Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 1 March 2021,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-1-march-2021,Health and Social Care Secretary,2021-03-01,"Good evening and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.I’m joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace.Since we spoke on Friday, I’m absolutely delighted that we’ve reached the milestone of more than 20 million people in the UK getting a vaccine against COVID-19.It’s a magnificent achievement for the country.First slide please.As of yesterday, 20,275,451 people have received a jab.I want to pay tribute to all the teams involved – across the whole of the UK – who are delivering the largest and fastest vaccination programme in British history.That we’ve been able to do this – and move so much faster than any other similar-sized nation – has depended on a huge number of people; it is not an accident.It’s down to insight and hard work.For the last year, we have shared a common mission: to deliver a vaccine, as fast as safely possible.We’ve got used to saying thank you to the people who have made this happen.But I just want to call out a few in particular.First, the regulator the MHRA – who have remained tough and rigorous throughout but flexible, so it’s safety, not bureaucracy they focused on, proving themselves to be, without doubt, the best medical regulator in the world. And we are all very gratefulNext, the Vaccines Taskforce. Their combination of academic excellence, with private sector entrepreneurialism, and civil service grip has forged a team of remarkable capability, which is a model for how governments can get stuff done in the future.The scientists, the pharmaceutical companies and the armed forces, everyone involved in the delivery effort – from the leadership of the NHS to every local volunteer.And you, the British people.For sticking by the rules and for your remarkable enthusiasm to get a jab – it makes me really proud.Recent figures show 94% of those eligible have said they have either had a jab – or will get the jab when the call comes. 94%.And this is so important because each and every jab makes us all safer.Every time a friend sends me a message with a picture of them getting their jab – and they do a lot – I know that we’re all one step safer and we’re all one step closer to returning to normality.It is fantastic the enthusiasm that people are showing and we still have a long way to go, so let’s stick at it.Today we have some new data to present on the effectiveness of the vaccine, both its real-world effect we can now see in the data and some new analytical research that we’re publishing, which shows how it’s saving lives, and this is being published in a paper by Public Health England and others right now.First, let’s look at the real-world data.Next slide please.If you look at the number of new cases as we described on Friday the number of new cases is falling but the rate of decline has slowed.This shows how we all need to keep sticking to the rules.Let’s not blow it now.However.Next slide please.The number of hospitalisations is falling faster.Even better: among the age groups vaccinated first, the fall in hospitalisations is faster than in the younger age groups who are still yet to get a jab.This is a sign of the vaccine working.Next slide please.But where you can really see it is in the data on deaths – we can see that the number of deaths each day is thankfully falling much much faster than after the first peak, and again, as you can see from this slide, is falling faster in the over-80s – who got the jab first – than in the under-80s.Final slide please.Taken together, this difference in the data – between older and younger groups – shows a ‘vaccine gap’, you can just see it starting to emerge here over February.This is a gap between the rate of decline in older and younger groups, the rate of decline in terms of people dying each day, is going faster amongst the over-80s and this shows in the real world, across the UK, right now, that the vaccine is helping to protect the NHS and save lives.These real-world effects are backed up by some exciting new data that shows that a single shot of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine or Pfizer vaccine works against severe infection amongst over-70s, with a more than 80% reduction in hospitalisations. This is extremely good news.In fact, the detailed data show that the protection that you get from catching COVID, 35 days after a first jab, is even slightly better for the Oxford jab than for Pfizer, albeit both results are clearly very strong. Professor Van-Tam is going to set more details in a moment.These results may also help explain why the number of COVID admissions to intensive care units among people over 80 in the UK have dropped to single figures in the last couple of weeks.Which is something that I know, we all welcome. This is seriously encouraging, it shows the power of science and what it means for you is that when the call comes – get the jab. The evidence shows it will protect you.And I can formally announce that we’re now inviting the over-60s to be vaccinated.All part of our national effort to offer everyone the jab by the end of July.To do that, and to make sure our vaccine programme has the funds it needs to keep up this incredible work, at the Budget on Wednesday, the Chancellor will set out £1.65 billion of new government funding to reinforce our vaccine rollout across all parts of the UK.As more of us are protected against the virus, we can gradually replace the safety that comes from the restrictions that we have to impose with the safety from the jab.Part of that funding will go towards further vaccine testing and development to make sure that we are as fast and effective in developing the next generation of COVID vaccines, including vaccines against variants, as we were with the existing ones.There’s a huge amount of work underway to ensure that we can develop vaccines against variants as fast and as safely possible.Finally, I want to turn to the 6 cases of the variant of concern first identified in Manaus, in Brazil that we have identified here in the UK, 3 in Scotland and 3 in England.We know that 5 of these people quarantined at home – as they were legally required to do.We have been in contact with them and their families, and are grateful to them for understanding the seriousness of the situation.We are putting in place surge testing in South Gloucestershire, as a precaution and I urge everyone to remain vigilant.One of the 6 completed a test but did not successfully complete contact details.We are therefore asking anyone who took a test on the 12 or 13 February but hasn’t received the result back, to please get in touch by calling 119 in England, Wales or Northern Ireland – and 0300 303 2713 in Scotland.And Susan Hopkins will give more information on this effort in a moment.We identified these cases thanks to the UK’s advanced sequencing capabilities. We know about them because of NHS Test and Trace, and scientists around the world are now working to get ahead of some of the new coronavirus variants, looking at how a third vaccine dose could tackle these evolving mutations – much as we do with flu each year.But for now, tackling this disease rests with every single one of us.It’s important to remember that, no matter what variant it is, COVID spreads in the same way, through social contact between people.The steps we can all take to stop its spread are the same.To stay at home, to take vital steps like hands, face, space, and make sure we observe the basics – letting fresh air in – and keeping to the rules on social distancing.And that’s how we can keep ourselves safe – and protect the people around us.And if we can do that, as surely as spring follows winter there will be brighter days ahead."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 February 2021,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-26-february-2021,Health and Social Care Secretary,2021-02-26,"Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.I’m joined by Professor Jonathan Van Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor to Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace.Before I share some news on our vaccination programme, I’d just like to update you on the latest coronavirus data.First slide please.Today’s ONS figures show that the number of cases is now down to 1 in every 145 people and that the rate of decline is continuing but actually the pace of it is slowing.The rate of hospital admissions show a fall of 40% over the past fortnight, but there are still 15,485 people in hospital, and that’s far too high.The number of deaths have more than halved in the last fortnight, but 380 deaths were reported each day on average over the last week. And that is far too high.The good news is that the link from cases, to hospitalisations and deaths, which has had a grim inevitability throughout 2020, that link is now breaking, thanks to the vaccination programme.This demonstrates as you can see that there’s been a fall in the number of cases, another fall, but that the speed of that fall is slowing slightly.And this fact and the fact that the pressure on the NHS has lifted means that the UK’s Chief Medical Officers have agreed that the UK alert level can be moved down from level 5, to level 4, which of course is great news. But level 4 still means the NHS is under serious pressure.The number of cases is now falling by only 15% a week. In some areas that has flattened entirely. And one in five local authorities have seen a rise in cases in the last week.I’m going to ask Professor Van Tam to set out more details of this and the geography in a moment.But I just want to say this about the figures. This stark picture shows this isn’t over yet. The stay-at-home rules are still in place for a reason.Every action that you take, every time you put your mask on, every time you stay at home – you are playing your part. This is on all of us to keep this under control.This is still a deadly virus. We will get through this. But we have to stick at it. We must all remain vigilant.Vaccination programmeAnd that brings me to the vaccination programme, because while the vaccination programme is rolling out at the pace of one of the fastest in the world, we’re not there yet.We can all take comfort that through science we have found a solution.We have got a route out, and we can gradually replace the protection that is there in the restrictions, with protection that comes from the vaccine and that is very good news.I’m delighted to be able to tell you that as of this morning, 19 million people have had the vaccine. That’s 35% of all adults across the United Kingdom.That also includes over half a million doses that were given yesterday.It’s easy for us to get used to these very large numbers. But that’s 19 million people who now are starting to get the protection that we know comes from this jab, and we know that the jabs are saving lives right now across this country.And of course the programme is expanding all the time.This week, we’re bringing 10 more major vaccination sites on stream, including Towngate Theatre in Basildon and Reading Football Club. And I thank everybody who is continuing this expansion of the vaccination rollout.These join our network across the country of cinemas and cathedrals, and mosques and museums, and so many other places that have been converted from whatever they do normally into these life-saving centres, right in the heart of our communities.And we’ve seen this incredible enthusiasm about coming forward too.As my colleague, Derek Grieve, who heads up Scotland’s rollout, told Her Majesty the Queen he’d like to ‘bottle the community spirit’ we’ve seen.And I’m very pleased to tell you that today’s ONS data shows 94% of adults say they’ve either received a jab or intend to do so. That is staggering. It’s really, really good news that there is so much enthusiasm for this jab.And it is testament to colleagues who have worked so hard to build the confidence in this jab, and make it as accessible as possible to people, which is what we’re constantly striving to do.I’d like to give a shout out to Farzana Hussain, who is a GP in East London, who’s been personally calling each of her priority patients, giving information about the vaccine and urging them to come forward and get jabbed.I also want to thank the whole team in Coventry and Warwickshire, who have delivered the highest uptake in the whole country, giving first doses to over 95% of over-65s in their area. Thank you. It’s an absolutely spectacular effort.This work is so important, and it’s important because the fightback against this disease rests with every single one of us.And the more people who are protected, the safer we’ll all be.So if you get the call, please come forward, to protect yourself and to protect those around you.Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation (JCVI)Now, throughout our vaccination programme, we’ve focused on protecting those at greatest clinical need. This is the final thing I want to turn to.We offered a vaccine, for instance, to everyone in the top 4 priority groups by 15 of February, and our current target is to offer a first dose to everyone in the top 9 groups by 15 of April.That’s everybody who’s 50 or over or part of an at-risk group.Earlier this month, I asked the clinicians at the JCVI to set out what is the best order to offer vaccinations for the under-50s.I asked them to make this assessment based on how we can save the most lives and prevent the most hospitalisations.Earlier today, they published their interim recommendations.Next slide please.The JCVI’s clinical advice is that to save the most lives, once we have offered the vaccine to priority groups 1 to 9, we should take an age-based approach, and invite people to come forward in 3 further stages:First, people aged between 40 and 49 years old, then 30 to 39, and finally, 18 to 29, who will become group 12.This is the fastest and simplest way to roll out the jab.Our moral duty is to put saving lives first. And that’s what we’ve done.So I can confirm that we will follow this clinical advice.We will get jabs into arms as quickly as we can, in the clinically recommended order.And once we’ve met the target, by 15 of April, we’ll move onto these priority groups 10, 11 and 12.I’m sure we all agree that the best approach is the one that saves the most lives.So that’s what we’re going to do, together.ConclusionWhile we make great progress on vaccines, with one of the fastest rollouts in the world, we all though still have to hold our nerve and do our bit.It’s on all of us, still, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.And I’d now like to hand over to Professor Van Tam."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 8 February 2021,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-8-february-2021,Health and Social Care Secretary,2021-02-08,"Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.I’m joined by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, and by NHS England’s Medical Director for Primary Care Dr Nikki Kanani.Before I update you on our coronavirus response, I’d like to take you through the latest data.There are still 29,326 patients with COVID in hospital across the UK – still more than at either the April or November peaks.And sadly, 841 deaths have been reported on average each day over the past week.My thoughts are with everyone who has lost a loved one to this deadly disease.Today, I’d like to update you on 3 important parts of the coronavirus response.VaccinesFirst, the next steps on the vaccination programme.It’s now 2 months since that wonderful day when Margaret Keenan got her first jab, the first person in the world to be vaccinated with a clinically authorised vaccine for coronavirus.We’ve now vaccinated as of today more than 12.2 million people.That’s almost one in 4 of all adults across the United Kingdom.Take-up of the vaccine so far has been significantly better than we hoped for.Based on the work we’d done before the vaccination programme started, and looking at the surveys, we knew that the UK had one of the most positive attitudes to vaccine uptake.But even so, we thought we’d get take-up of around 75%.I’m really pleased to be able to tell you that, as of midnight last night, among the over 80s, we’ve now given a first dose to 91%; among those aged between 75 and 79, it’s 95%. And almost three-quarters of those aged between 70 and 74, who were the most recent group to be invited.We’ve also visited every eligible care home with older residents, and offered vaccinations to all their residents and staff.So among eligible care home residents, the take-up is 93%.But we’ll not rest until we vaccinate all those in the most at-risk groups.Because vaccines save lives. They protect you, and there’s increasing evidence they protect those around you too.The fewer people who are left unprotected, the safer we’ll all be and the more securely we’ll be able to release restrictions when the time is right.I’ve been thrilled to see so much enthusiasm about coming forward for a jab, and I’m just so pleased that take-up has been so high.But we’re not going to rest until all those who are vulnerable have been protected.So the NHS, and local authorities, and the teams working with them are doing everything they can to reach the remaining people in these groups and we’ll keep on searching for those final few per cent, even as we expand the offer of a vaccine to younger age groups.I’m going to ask Dr Kanani to say a few words more about this project in a moment.We’re on track to meet our goal of offering a vaccine to everyone in priority groups 1 to 4 by the 15th of February – one week today – before moving onto the other JCVI priority groups.The NHS has worked hard to contact everyone in groups 1 to 4.But we want to be certain.So, from today, I have a message for everyone aged 70 and above.Until now, we’ve said please wait for the NHS to contact you.But now that message is changing.If you live in England, and are 70 and over, and have not yet got an appointment to get vaccinated please contact the NHS.The easiest way is to do this is through the National Booking Service, online at nhs.uk.Or if you can’t get online then you can call 119 or you can speak to your local GP practice.If you’re in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, we are also on track, working together to meet the goal by the 15th February, and your local health team will be in touch.I’m so grateful to the whole team who are delivering this vaccination programme so brilliantly across the whole United Kingdom.And to everyone who’s doing their bit, by baring their arms, and getting the jab.TestingWhile we use our vaccination programme to go on the offensive against this virus, it’s very important we keep our defences up as well.Our testing programme has also grown at a blistering rate.We’re now carrying out, on average, 4.5 million tests every single week.NHS Test and Trace is returning 97% of in-person test by the next day contact tracing is performing incredibly well, reaching over 97% of contacts where details are given – and 98% of those they’re reaching within 24 hours.I want to say a massive thank you to the NHS Test and Trace, who have built this extraordinary capability almost from scratch.Even in lockdown, testing to find out where the virus is, is critical to break the chains of transmission and to find those positive cases so people isolate and stop the spread.Today I’m delighted to be able to announce another step forward, to bolster our on-shore test manufacturing capacity.We’re joining forces with the Derby-based manufacturer Surescreen, to deliver 20 million rapid tests, which can produce results in 30 minutes.They’ll be used in our asymptomatic testing programme to identify the around one in 3 people who get the virus without any symptoms at all yet can still pass it on.This expanded capacity means we can offer more regular testing to even more people.Many employers are already taking up our offer of rapid, regular workplace testing which has protected critical workers like in the NHS and schools, so they can keep going.Employers who’ve introduced workplace testing tell me that they find it useful for early identification of people who have COVID and so the number of outbreaks reduces as time goes on and so lowers the number of people who are off work with COVID. This is a really important part of what we want to do.Now, from today, we’re expanding the offer of regular workplace testing to all businesses with over 50 employees, in sectors that are currently open.Testing will become even more important as we exit lockdown, when the time is right.For now of course, you must work from home if you can.But if you can’t, we want to make sure we’re providing as much certainty and confidence as possible. I’d urge all eligible employers to take up this offer. You can go online to the portal at gov.uk/coronavirus.And this will all help to keep vital services going, and to keep the virus on the back foot.New variantsThe third thing I want to touch on is our work to tackle new variants.All viruses mutate over time. And part of controlling any virus is responding to new variants as they arise.We do this every year with flu, for instance.Knowing this, we invested in genomic sequencing capability right at the start of this pandemic genomic sequencing is how you identify new variants giving the UK one of the biggest genomic sequencing capabilities in the world.In fact we’ve provided almost half of global COVID sequencing.This genomic capacity has allowed us to spot variants here at home and is allowing us to support others to detect variants in other parts of the world.We musn’t let a new variant undo all of the good work that the vaccine rollout is doing to protect people.Now, the first line of defence is to spot and suppress new variants aggressively wherever they’re found.Hence the tougher measures at the border and the firm action we’re taking in those small number of areas where variants of concern have been found in the community Including door-to-door communications, and enhanced testing and sequencing.At the same time, since the emergence of variants of concern late last year, we’ve been working on how vaccines can be used to tackle them.It is imperative that our vaccination programme keeps pace with any changes to this virus.And Professor Van-Tam will be saying a little bit more about what we’re doing.The work has 3 parts.First, the evidence is that the existing vaccines have some effect against new variants particularly preventing serious illness and mortality so the existing vaccine rollout is mission critical for tackling new variants too.Second, we’re working with the existing vaccine suppliers on potential booster jabs, targeted specifically at the new variants, to strengthen this protection further.Third, we’re building on-shore UK capacity, including cutting edge mRNA technologies to give us the ability rapidly to develop and deploy vaccines against any new variants, or similar new diseases, in the future.We’ve entered into a new partnership with the vaccine manufacturer CureVac to develop vaccines that can be quickly adapted as new strains are identified just as we do for the flu vaccine every year.I’m determined that we build this capacity right here securely here in the UK.To protect everyone across these islands, not just from new variants but for the long term too.We’ve agreed an initial supply of 50 million doses, to add to the 400 million doses that are already in our vaccine portfolio so we’ll be prepared for whatever the future might bring.Of course, the fewer new cases of coronavirus that we have, the lower the chance of a new variant appearing domestically.So the essential message to stay at home and follow the social distancing rules is our best defence right now.Taking all this together, what I want to say is this.The number of people in hospital is still far too high, but it is falling. The number of deaths is far too high, but that is falling too. We’re turning a corner in our battle against coronavirus.The vaccine rollout is going well – and if you’re aged 70 and over and haven’t been contacted yet, please get in touch now.And all the time, we must be vigilant and do what it takes to tackle any new variants that arise.For now, the most important thing you can do is: get the jab when your time comes.Stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 1 February 2021,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-1-february-2021,Health and Social Care Secretary,2021-02-01,"Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.And I’m joined by Professor Steve Powis, the Medical Director of NHS England. And Dr Susan Hopkins, who is the Chief Medical Advisor to Public Health England and to NHS Test and Trace.I’ve got quite a lot of news to bring you up to speed on. Right at the start, I wanted to tell you where we are with our vaccine programme.I’m so proud of the team, who’ve now vaccinated 9.2 million people across the UK, that includes 931,204 vaccinations just this weekend.And to put that into context – that’s one in every 60 adults in the whole United Kingdom vaccinated in one single weekend. It’s a mammoth effort.I know how much these jabs mean to people. And I’m so grateful for all the messages that we get, and all the pictures that I’m sent of people being vaccinated.It fills me with pride that so many people are doing so much to help for this roll out to happen so smoothly and I want to say thanks to you all.Care homesGetting vaccinated is an emotional moment for so many people and that’s because it is about protecting those who are most vulnerable to COVID.We’ve now vaccinated almost 9 in 10 of all over 80s in the UK and now, as of today, we’ve vaccinated over half of all people in their 70s.And, I’m delighted that I can tell you we’ve visited every eligible care home with older residents in England, and offered vaccinations to all their residents and staff.This has been an incredible example of health and social care working together, working side-by-side to protect people most in need.As Professor Martin Green, the Chief Executive of Care England said today, this is a “wonderful achievement and one that is testament to the hard work of care home staff and our colleagues in the NHS and local authorities.”And, I want to thank every single person who’s helped us to get this far.Vaccine supplyI also want to let you know some good news on vaccine supply. Today we’ve ordered another 40 million vaccine doses from Valneva.As we have all along, we’ve invested early and at risk, before we know for sure if it will come good because from the start, we’ve taken a no regrets attitude to backing vaccines. We’ve tried to leave nothing on the table.If this gets regulatory approval, the Valneva vaccine, like many others, will be made right here in the UK.The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is made in Oxford, and Staffordshire, and Wrexham. The Novovax vaccine is being manufactured on Teesside. And if approved, this Valneva vaccine will be manufactured in Livingston, in Scotland.We didn’t start this pandemic with a large-scale on-shore vaccine manufacturing capability, so we’re building one, all across the United Kingdom.The vaccine programme just goes to show how important it is to have the UK working as one, together.InternationalWe now have over 400 million doses of vaccines on order. This is obviously more than the UK population needs. And my attitude has always been we protect every UK citizen as fast as we can. And at the same time, we’re generous around the world.I want to say this to our international partners. Of course, I’m delighted about how well this is going at home. But I believe fundamentally that the vaccine roll out is a global effort.One of the many reasons that I’m so happy with the AstraZenenca contract is that it not just that it gives us a strong supply here but because it is the only vaccine being deployed that’s available to the whole world at cost.And because it’s logistically straightforward, it can be practically deployed in the poorest parts of the world too.So, we will protect UK supply and we’ll play our part to ensure the whole world can get the jab.New variantsAnother area where we’re helping around the world is in spotting new variants.Our global leadership in genomic sequencing has helped us to spot new variants here in the UK, and quickly alert the rest of the world. But there are other countries that don’t have the capacity they need.Last week, we offered our capacity and expertise to other nations through our New Variant Assessment Platform, because a mutation in one part of the world is a threat to people everywhere.For example, our South African colleagues spotted a new variant through their high quality genomic sequencing and rightly notified the world, as we did with the variant that we discovered here in the UK.We’ve now identified 105 cases of this variant here. Eleven of those cases don’t appear to have any links to international travel.There’s currently no evidence to suggest this variant is any more severe, but we need to come down on it hard and we will. We’ve already made sure that all these cases are isolating and that we’ve done enhanced contact tracing of all of their close contacts.We are surging extra testing into the areas where this variant has been found and sequencing every single positive case.Working with local authorities, we are going door-to-door to test people in the local area. These cases have been identified in the following postcodes:W7, N17, CR4, WS2, ME15, EN10, GU21, and PR9If you live in one of these postcodes where we’re sending in enhanced testing, then it’s imperative that you stay at home. And that you get a test, even if you don’t have symptoms.This is so important so that we can break the chains of transmission of this new variant. And we’ve got to bring this virus to heel.So there’s lots of good news, but this is a stark reminder that the fight against this virus isn’t over yet.Every day, we’re protecting more people and getting ourselves one step closer to normal life. But this is no time to let things slip. So let’s, all of us, do what we must to get this virus under control."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 25 January 2021,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-25-january-2021,Health and Social Care Secretary,2021-01-25,"Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing. I’m joined by our Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries and Dr Susan Hopkins, who is the Chief Medical Advisor to Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace.I want to update you on the latest coronavirus data – and the vaccine rollout. In the last week in the UK, we have seen 37,258 cases of coronavirus, on average each day. The NHS is still under intense pressure across all parts of the country with 37,899 people in UK hospitals with COVID-19 – and that includes 4,076 on ventilators.Sadly, today 592 more deaths were reported. We must never forget the real impact of this disease. The loved ones that we’ve lost. Grandparents. Parents. Friends. Colleagues. We grieve for each one. And the pressure on the front line, I can tell you, is just so relentless. And when I talk to my colleagues who are working in COVID wards.They are flat out and they are stretched to the limit. They’re doing everything they can. And I want to say a huge thank you to all those colleagues who are working so hard – they are pulling a huge shift and it’s a duty on all of us to support them.I want to extend that thanks also to our ambulance service workers and in particular I want to thank ambulance service staff who stepped up over the weekend when an appeal went out from the Scottish Ambulance Service for extra help and ambulance services from the other nations stepped forward.Our health systems across the UK routinely work closely together – offering support when its needed. From vaccines to ambulance services, and the UK is stronger together in the fight against this pandemic.I know how tough that fight is. Thankfully, there are early signs that the actions we’re taking are working. The rise in the number of cases is slowing – and falling in some parts of the country like London and Scotland. At the same time, the number of vaccinations is going up.Like many of you, I’ve been talking to members of my family who’ve just had the call to be vaccinated. It’s a really emotional moment when people get vaccinated. It means so much to people because the vaccine brings safety to that individual and marks the route out for us all from this pandemic.I’m so proud to be able to tell you that we have, as of last night, vaccinated 78.7% of all over 80s. That’s almost 4 in 5 of everyone aged over 80. I’m delighted – you can see from these figures – there’s so much enthusiasm for vaccination amongst the over 80s because octogenarians know what the scientists know: which is that the vaccines save lives.Of course, the rate limiting factor to this vaccination programme remains supply. As we know, supply is tight. We’ve had a very strong performance in this past week. And I’m confident that the NHS will deliver every shot that’s made available to it. To help with that, today we opened a further 32 large-scale vaccination centres including at Blackpool Winter Gardens, the Black Country Living Museum – better known to many as the set of Peaky Blinders – and London’s Francis Crick Institute – itself no stranger to human ingenuity.And I’m determined to get vaccine uptake as high as possible. Today we’re funding councils to enhance their vital efforts to engage those who are hardest to reach through our Community Champions scheme. As of today, 6.6 million have now received a vaccine against COVID-19. That’s more than 1 in 9 of the adult population.On Saturday alone, we gave nearly half a million jabs. In the last week, 2.5 million people have been vaccinated across the UK. That’s a rate of more than 250 people a minute.We’re on track to offer everyone in the top 4 priority groups a jab by the 15 February. If you’re in one of those groups, one of the top 4 priority groups, and you haven’t had the call yet, don’t worry: the NHS will be in touch.It’s a truly national effort. Alongside the GPs, pharmacists and other NHS staff and of course Armed Forces working so hard – alongside all of them working every weekend every evening. I particularly want to thank the 80,000 people who stepped forward to help deliver this, doing things like volunteering to stand in car parks for 8 hours a day – in the freezing cold to ensure elderly people can safely get into a vaccination centre.It’s truly heart-warming. We’ve seen this selfless attitude towards the vaccination programme and it makes me very proud and very grateful to all those who have stepped forward. Because we know the responsibility for our fightback against this disease rests with every one of us. That is equally true when it comes to following the rules and maintaining social distancing.Social distancing works – by denying the virus the social contact it needs to spread. I want to reiterate an important point made by the Chief Medical Officers and the clinical advice that they have been giving: even if you’ve had the jab, the rules still apply.There’s 2 reasons for this. First, because the protection takes time. Your body’s immune is only fully trained up around three weeks after your jab. And, even if you have protection yourself, we still don’t know whether you will be able to pass coronavirus on to someone else.We are monitoring this very carefully and will publish information on it as soon as we have it available. So this is not a moment to ease up.The success of our vaccine rollout means we cannot – cannot – put our progress at risk.The final thing I want to say is this. There’s no question that the new variants have made this fight a whole lot tougher. And I want to set out again, precisely what we know about the new variants. As with all science – as we have throughout this unprecedented crisis – we are learning more all the time.The new variant first discovered in Kent – which comprises now a significant number of our cases now – is spreading 30 to 70% more easily than the existing variant. Based on analysis conducted by academic colleagues in a variety of studies there is a realistic possibility that this variant may be associated with increased mortality compared to the old variant – as well as increased transmission.Because of our extensive genomic sequencing, we have identified cases of the new variant first identified in South Africa and that one that was first identified in Brazil. Further scientific work is underway to understand more about these variants but in the meantime it reinforces the critical message that we must be cautious.For all of us, our response must to be extra careful stay at home – maintain social distancing. We’ve all frankly sacrificed too much and its so important that we protect lives and we’re making progress with the vaccine.With the end in sight we cannot put that progress at risk. And there’s a promise of better days that lie ahead we have to hold our nerve and persevere through this difficult winter. So it’s incumbent on us all, wherever possible to stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives."
Home Secretary's statement on coronavirus: 21 January 2021,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/home-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-21-january-2021,Home Secretary,2021-01-21,"Good afternoon.I am joined today by Dr Vin Diwakar, NHS England Regional Medical Director for London, and Martin Hewitt, Chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council.The rollout of our fantastic vaccination programme continues to make good progress.The brilliant NHS is vaccinating people at the rate of 200 jabs per minute.And as of today, four million, nine hundred and seventy-three thousand, two hundred and forty-eight people have been vaccinated across the United Kingdom.The NHS are working as quickly, efficiently and as fairly as possible to get the vaccine to priority groups.And I want to take this moment and opportunity to counter some of the disinformation about the vaccine – especially any messages targeted towards those from an ethnic minority background.This vaccine is safe for us all.It will protect you and your family.It is our best chance of beating this virus.So I urge everyone across our wonderfully diverse country to get the vaccine when their turn comes to keep us all safe.But we are sadly not out of the woods yet, this virus remains severe and it is a deadly threat.Our NHS is under immense pressure and large numbers of people are still falling ill and, sadly, dying.So it is absolutely crucial that you stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.Since yesterday, thirty-seven thousand eight hundred and ninety-two people have tested positive for coronavirus.As of 19 January, thirty-eight thousand, six hundred and seventy-six people were in hospital with coronavirus.  That is up 4.8 per cent from the week before.Of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, sadly ninety-four thousand, five-hundred and eighty people have died. That’s one thousand, two-hundred and ninety fatalities since yesterday.Every death is a tragedy and these numbers demonstrate, that this country remains in the grip of a pandemic.My thoughts go to all of those who have lost loved ones.The sacrifices that millions of you are making day in, day out are starting to make a difference.By staying at home, you are helping to keep those you care about safe, and contributing to this national effort.But there is still a small minority who refuse to do the right thing.To them, my message is clear: if you do not follow these rules, then the police will enforce them.Police officers are now moving more quickly to handing out fines when they encounter breaches. And they have my absolute backing in doing so.As we have done throughout this pandemic, we are constantly reviewing our approach to ensure that we can crack down on the most serious cases of rule-breaking.And today I can announce that next week we will be introducing a new £800 fine for those attending house parties, which will double for each repeat offence to a maximum level of £6,400.These fines will apply to those who attend illegal gatherings of more than 15 people in homes.The science is clear: such irresponsible behaviour poses a significant threat to public - not only to those in attendance, but also to the wonderful police officers who attend to shut down these events.From the outset, we have given the police the necessary powers to enforce the rules, which are in place to stop the spread of the virus.As this latest measure demonstrates, we will not stand by while a small number of individuals put others at risk.I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our police forces and our fire services for their extraordinary contribution throughout the pandemic.They are out there each and every day, supporting our communities, risking their own health to keep the rest of us safe.And we have seen in their own commitment during this whole response to the flooding caused by Storm Christoph.During such a difficult time for this country, the commitment and courage shown by our emergency services has been truly inspiring.Everyone has a role to play in our fight against this virus.So please: stay at home so we can protect the NHS and save lives.I will now hand over to Martin Hewitt, Chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 18 January 2021,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-18-january-2021,Health and Social Care Secretary,2021-01-18,"Welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing. And I’m joined by Professor Steven Powis, the Medical Director of NHS England and by Dr Susan Hopkins, the Chief Medical Adviser to Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace.And I want to bring you up to date with the latest data on the disease and on our vaccine plan in order to combat it.Today, 37,535 positive cases of coronavirus were recorded. The NHS is under significant pressure in all parts of the country.There are 37,475 people in UK hospitals with coronavirus – that is the highest that it’s been throughout the pandemic and someone is admitted to hospital every 30 seconds.And sadly, today 599 more deaths were recorded. That’s 599 more people who have died from this terrible disease and left loved ones and their families in mourning.And I know the pain that this disease causes – and I’m determined to do everything we possibly can to defeat it, and I know that is what you want too.And our vaccine delivery plan is absolutely at the core of this, it is our way out. It’s also the biggest medical deployment in British history and it’s one of the biggest civilian operations that this country’s ever undertaken.Our approach is, of course, to save as many lives as possible – as quickly as possible and to reduce the pressure on the NHS.We’re on track to deliver our plan to vaccinate the most vulnerable groups by the middle of February, the groups that account for 88% of COVID deaths.And I’m very glad to report that, as of midnight last night, we have now vaccinated 4,062,501 people across the United Kingdom, and we’re currently vaccinating more than double the rate – per person per day – than any other country in Europe.Latest data show that we’ve now vaccinated more than half of those over 80 as well as half of our elderly care home residents.And we all know these are the groups most vulnerable to COVID and we know that every jab counts and I am really pleased that we’ve been able to meet this milestone.Some areas of the country have done even better. There are some parts where the vast majority of octogenarians have been vaccinated and there are some places – for instance Slough – who have vaccinated all of their care home residents.And so, I want to thank all those who’ve been doing this enormous task and in particular Slough, and other places around the country, who have reached the critical goal of making sure that every body in a care home can be vaccinated.And this means that, in those areas, where the vast majority of people in the top two priority groups have been vaccinated, from today, we can start moving on to the over 70s, and those under 70 who are clinically extremely vulnerable.We’re doing this because it’s the best way both to maximise the pace of the rollout and deliver according to the clinical prioritisation. All with the goal of saving as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible and reducing the pressures on the NHS.And I want to say to anybody aged over 80 but hasn’t yet had their jab, I want to say we will reach you. The NHS will contact you and you will have your invitation to be vaccinated within the next 4 weeks.And I’m absolutely determined to do all that I possibly can to support people in care homes, while we get this vaccination done as soon as possible.Over the weekend I announced £120 million to support staffing levels in social care, and that’s in addition to the £149 million we recently made available to support the regular staff testing in care homes.And I want to thank everyone working in social care for the incredible way that you’ve stepped up for those who you care for – you make us all proud.And I know – that as we continue to live under these difficult restrictions – people want to know the way forward for everyone.Our vaccine programme continues to accelerate and expand – and another 10 large-scale vaccination centres came on stream in England just this morning.But in the meantime we must all continue to play our part. We must stay at home wherever possible and take vital steps like the basics of hands, face and space, letting fresh air in – and keeping to the rules on social distancing.Don’t blow it now. We’re on the route out. We’re protecting the most vulnerable, we’re getting the virus under control. Together, I know that we can do it.And we’ve got to stick at it and especially with our plans for all adults in the UK to be offered a COVID vaccine by September.And just before I end, I just want to say this: there are many more ways that everybody can help in this great national effort.Of course, following the rules is the single most important thing that people can do. But more formally, people are helping by being a community volunteer, or signing up for clinical trials for vaccines and for therapeutics.Or, the 50,000 people who’ve now signed up for the Sun’s ‘Jabs Army’ – smashing the target, in the battle against this disease.And I want to thank each and everyone of you, and the Sun newspaper for leading in this part of the national effort.But also informally too – and this is something that I know so many people are already doing in every part of the country – and I see it every day, and people talk to me about it all of the time.And it really inspires me, how people are helping in adversity. Like a grandson, helping their grandma to book an appointment online, or neighbours dropping off essentials on the doorstep, or the community groups that are getting together to help drive people to a vaccination centre so that people can get that all important jab.I find it really heartening, and the kind actions we’re seeing from so many people – especially when people need help.So, thank you for all that you are doing for your loved ones, for your communities, for your friends and colleagues and neighbours.Being there for each other is so important in these difficult days – and that spirit that can help us all get to the brighter times that I know are ahead.Thank you for watching so far and now we are going to turn straight to the questions."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 January 2021,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-15-january-2021,Prime Minister,2021-01-15,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 January 2021Good afternoon.As you know, this country is engaged in the biggest and fastest vaccination programme in our history, and the chances are that you know someone personally who has already received a vaccine.But it would be fatal if this sense of progress were now to breed any kind of complacency because the pressures on our NHS are extraordinary.On Tuesday we saw 4,134 new admissions to hospital on a single day, the highest at any point in this pandemic.There are now more than 37,000 Covid patients in hospital across the UK and, in spite of all the efforts of our doctors and nurses and our medical staff, we are now seeing cancer treatments sadly postponed, ambulances queuing, and intensive care units spilling over into adjacent wards.And with 55,761 positive cases since yesterday and, very sadly, 1,280 deaths, this is not the time for the slightest relaxation of our national resolve and our individual efforts.So please stay at home, please protect the NHS and save lives.And please remember that this disease can be passed on not just by standing too near someone in a supermarket queue, but also by handling something touched by an infected person.And remember also that 1 in 3 people with Covid have no symptoms, and that is why that original message of hands, face and space, washing your hands, is as important now as it has ever been.And it is precisely because we have the hope of that vaccine and the risk of new strains coming from overseas that we must take additional steps now to stop those strains from entering the country.So, yesterday we announced that we are banning flights from South America and Portugal.And, to protect us against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains, we will also temporarily close all travel corridors from 0400 on Monday.Following conversations with the devolved administrations, we will act together so that this applies across the whole of UKThis means that if you come to this country, you must have proof of a negative Covid test that you have taken in the 72 hours before leaving and you must have filled in your Passenger Locator Form, and your airline will ask for proof of both before you take off.You may also be checked when you land and face substantial fines for refusing to complyAnd, upon arrival, you must then quarantine for ten days – not leaving your home for any reason at all, or take another test on day 5 and wait for proof of another negative result.And we will be stepping up our enforcement – both at the border and in-country.And it is vital to take these extra measures now when day by day, hour by hour, we are making such strides in protecting the population.We have now vaccinated over 3.2 million people across the UK, doubling the numbers of last week.That’s 2.8 million in England, 225,000 in Scotland, 126,000 in Wales and 115,000 in Northern Ireland.Yesterday alone, we vaccinated around a quarter of a million people in England, and that is still far more than any other country in Europe.And with almost 45 per cent of our over 80s now vaccinated and almost 40 per cent of care home residents, we are steadily protecting those most at risk.And I pay particular tribute to the vaccination efforts going on in Cockermouth, in Cumbria, Yateley and Cheltenham, where they have vaccinated around 90 per cent of their over-80s in their communities. And I’ll also pay tribute to North Lincolnshire, to Sunderland and Morecambe Bay, where vaccination teams have protected over 80 per cent of their care home residents.And it’s thanks to that amazing constellation of the vaccination teams: doctors and nursesarmed forces, local authorities, pharmacies and volunteers that we are steadily building up that immunity, that protection for the vulnerable, for the NHS and for us all.So, when the call comes, please do get a jab and, in the meantime, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 11 January 2021,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-11-january-2021,Health and Social Care Secretary,2021-01-11,"Health and Social Care Secretary’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 11 January 2021Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.I’m joined by Professor Steve Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England.Before I turn to our vaccine delivery plan, which we’ve published today, I wanted to go through the latest coronavirus data.As we know, the new strain of this virus is highly contagious, and it is putting our NHS under very significant pressure.Yesterday 46,169 positive cases of coronavirus were recorded across the whole of the UK.As the slide shows, 32,294 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus – that’s across the UK and as you can see that is up sharply, it’s up 22% from this time last week.The average number of deaths reported each day over the past week is 926.And our hearts go out to the family and the loved ones of each and every person who has died of coronavirus.As the Chief Medical Officer said earlier today, we are at the worst point of this pandemic, and you can see that from this slide and from the increase in the number of people in hospital.So the NHS, more than ever before, needs everybody to be doing something right now and that something is to follow the rules.Now, I know there’s been speculation about more restrictions.And we don’t rule out taking further action if it’s needed.But it’s your actions now that can make a difference. Stay at home. And please reduce all social contact that is not absolutely strictly necessary.That’s what’s needed.Act like you have the virus.And it’s all the more important to do this because the vaccine rollout is now proceeding at pace and we all know that this is the way out of the pandemic.I am determined, as I have been for almost a year now, to drive this vaccination programme as fast as is safely possible.I’m determined to ensure every adult in this country has the chance to be vaccinated.And that as many as possible take up that chance to be vaccinated.Vaccines are important and I care about vaccines because I want our country to get back to normal as fast as possible.I want us to have that great British summer.And my team and I are working hard to deliver this as fast as possible, both to save lives and to make people safe and to protect the NHS and reduce the very significant pressures it’s under right now.Vaccines delivery planI wanted to bring you up to speed with the very latest statistics on vaccination.So far, across the UK we’ve given 2.6 million doses to 2.3 million people.And we’ve protected more people through vaccinations than all other countries in Europe put together.Today I’d like to take you through the details of our UK COVID-19 vaccines delivery plan that we’ve just published.It sets out how we will build on this work that’s been done so far, and put in place the biggest vaccination programme in British history.There are 4 parts to the plan.The first is supply.I’ve always believed in British science, and that it can find the solutions to get us out of this.For a year now we have been working to develop and buy vaccines for everyone in the UK.Thanks to our investment in Ebola and MERS vaccines several years ago, the Jenner Institute at Oxford University was able to repurpose existing work, and move so fast to develop a successful vaccine.But our search has been global throughout, so while we’ve backed the scientists who’ve been working on this here at home, we’ve also worked with international partners like Pfizer and BioNTech, to ensure that we were the first country in the world to authorise, and use the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.And of course the Moderna vaccine has now been authorised and is ready to bring on stream.I want to thank all those involved, but this work is not yet done.The supply of the vaccine is currently the rate limiting step.And we will bring forward as much vaccine as becomes available.And we must ensure that we have the vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities in this country for the future too.The next part of the plan is prioritisation, this has been much discussed.The plan sets out how we prioritise the vaccine so that we can protect those at greatest clinical risk. And one simple statistic explains why this is important.The top 4 priority groups account for 88% of the deaths from COVID.This stark fact explains why we must prioritise according to clinical need – to save lives – and because that is the fastest route to safely lifting restrictions.We are on track to deliver on our pledge to offer a first vaccine to everyone in the top 4 cohorts by the 15th of February.I want to give you an update on progress.Two-fifths of over 80s have now received their first dose.Care home residents are of course in the very top priority group.In the last few days, since the Oxford vaccine was approved for use in primary care on Thursday morning, we have significantly accelerated the care home vaccination rollout.Almost a quarter of older care home residents have now received their first dose of the vaccine.We are committed to reaching every care home resident this month.And I want to see as much of that as possible as soon as possible.I’m incredibly grateful to everybody working in social care.Whether in care homes, or domiciliary care, for everything they are doing to keep the people who are the most vulnerable to COVID, to keep them safe right now.This is not easy, but it is vital. And it is vital too that when the vaccine reaches your care home, everyone, everyone, residents and staff alike steps forward and gets that jab.Each of these jabs helps save lives. And we’re making this happen as fast as we can.The plan sets out how we will continue through the clinically prioritised groups, and beyond.So all adults can be offered a vaccine by the autumn.The third part of the plan is expanding where you can be vaccinated.As of Friday, 96% of the population in England lived within 10 miles of a vaccination site and we’re expanding the number of vaccination sites further, right across the whole of the UK, with the devolved NHS responsible for delivery in each of the 3 devolved nations, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.This expansion will include community pharmacy and roving vaccination centres, on top of the hospitals, GP practices, and the 7 mass vaccination centres, that we have opened, including the one I visited today at Epsom.This huge expansion means that by the end of January everyone will live within 10 miles of a vaccination centre, either fixed or roving in England. And this will help us make sure that everyone can get access to the vaccine that’s so important.The final part of this plan is about the people who will make it happen.Over the past few months, we have recruited and trained an 80,000 strong vaccination workforce.I am incredibly grateful to all who have stepped forward.Including people from all parts of the NHS:    retired clinicians        pharmacists        airline cabin crew        the armed services        St John’s Ambulance        The Royal Voluntary Service  And so many volunteers who have come forward for their country.Thank you for your service.And I’m very grateful to the many offers of support we’re receiving right now, and for all those who are in training as this vaccination rollout expands.So that is the vaccine delivery plan. It is an incredibly important piece of work.But while this crucial work takes place, each and every one of us must keep pushing back against this virusBy following the rules that are in place.Please do your bit and help keep the NHS strongWhile we roll up our sleeves and make this ambitious plan a reality.So please, stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 7 January 2021,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-7-january-2021,Prime Minister,2021-01-07,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 7 January 2021Good afternoon, today I’m joined by Sir Simon Stevens, Chief Executive of NHS Englandand Brigadier Phil Prosser, who is Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme across our United Kingdom.Because I know there is now one question at the very top of your mindsand that is how fast and how effectively we can get these millions of new vaccines into the arms of the most vulnerable and those who need them most.And you want to know that we in government,the NHS, the Armed Forces, local and regional government, government at every levelare truly throwing everything at itround the clock if necessary.And I believe that with the country once again in lockdownand all the difficulties that means for you, for your family, for students, for education, for your businesses,and of course with the tragic number of deaths that we’re seeing and that we’ve seen today,you have a right to understand exactly how we are cracking this problem and how the national vaccine effort is progressing.And you rightly want to know how we are going to reach the target that I set out earlier this weekof offering a slot for vaccination by 15th of February for everyone in those key groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and ImmunisationThat’s over 12 million people in England, and 15 million in the UKincluding older care home residents and staffeveryone 70 or overall frontline NHS and care staffand all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable.And just to remind you of the importance of these groups for fighting the diseasethey account for 88 per cent of all those who have sadly lost their lives.And so our tactics arefirst to use the immense natural capacity of the NHSand by the end of next week there will beover 1,000 GP-led sites providing vaccines223 hospital sitesseven giant vaccination centresand a first wave of 200 community pharmaciesIf all goes well these together should have the capacity to deliver hundreds of thousands of vaccines per day by Jan 15thand it is our plan that everyone should have a vaccination available within a radius of ten miles.And it follows from that that the limits will not be on our distributional power but on the supply of vaccines.And I have no doubt that we have enough supply to vaccinate these four groups by the Feb 15th deadline and we also have the distributional network to do itand to continue an expanding programme down that priority list.Yes, let’s be clear this is a national challenge on a scale like nothing we have seen beforeand it will require an unprecedented national effort.And, of course there will be difficultiesappointments will be changedbut as Brigadier Prosser will shortly explainthe army is working hand in glove with the NHS and local councils to set up our vaccine networkand using battle preparation techniques to help us keep up the pace.We will publish our full vaccine deployment plan on Mondayalong with daily updates on the progress we are making.We have now vaccinated 1.26 million people in England,113,000 in Scotland,49,000 in Wales,and 46,000 in Northern Ireland.So altogether, nearly 1.5 million people across the UK have now received their first doseand within 2-3 weeks all of them will have a very considerable degree of immunity.And it is thanks to the arrival of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine which can be stored at room temperature,that we can accelerate the pace of vaccination in care homes.We are using that vaccine in care homes for the first time todayand by the end of the month we hope to have offered every elderly care home resident a vaccine.Our new National Booking Service will also make it easier to book and access appointmentsSo I urge everyone to comes forwardsbecause it’s absolutely vital that we should have confidence in these vaccines.And I want to thank everyone involved in this extraordinary national effortall the GPs, nurses, pharmacists and all the staff behind the scenesour armed forceslocal councilsour scientists who have not only developed the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the first ever life-saving treatment of Covid in the form of dexamethasone –but I am pleased to tell you today, British scientific research has now contributed to the creation of more new lifesaving treatments that have just passed rigorous clinical trials.In particular, Tocilizumab, sorry I’ll say it again, Tocilizumaband Sarilumab, they’ll shortly be on everybody’s lipswhich have been found to reduce the risk of death for critically ill patients by almost a quarterand they’ve cut time spent in intensive care by as much as ten daysand these lifesaving drugs will be available through the NHS with immediate effect,potentially saving thousands of lives.And finally again I want to thank you – the British public – for coming forward to be vaccinatedin the numbers that you have - still greater than all the countries of Europe put together.And yes of course, we are in a race against timebut I can assure you we’re doing everything we can to vaccinate as many people as possible across our whole United Kingdom.And in the meantimeplease stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives.And now I’ll hand over to Sir Simon Stevens"
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 January 2021,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-january-2021,Prime Minister,2021-01-05,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 January 2021Good afternoon,I want to update everybody about vaccinesbecause across this entire country today there are people – everybody - making another huge sacrifice.Teachers and pupils coping with online learningBusinesses who have borne the brunt of successive lockdowns and, of course, the amazing staff of our NHS and our care workers who are grappling with a new variant - this new variant - of coronavirus.And I believe that when everybody looks at the position people understand overwhelmingly that we have no choicewhen the Office of National Statistics is telling us that more than 2 per cent of the population is now infectedthat’s over 1 million people in England –and when today we have reported another 60,000 new casesand when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40 per cent higher than at the first peak in April.I think obviously – everybody, you all - want to be sure that we in government are now using every second of this lockdown to put that invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable in the form of vaccinationand so to begin to bring this crisis to an end.And I can tell you that this afternoonwith Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca combined – as of this afternoonwe have now vaccinated over 1.1 million people in England and over 1.3 million across the UK.And that includes more than 650,000 people over 80which is 23 per cent of all the over 80s in England -And that means that nearly 1 in 4 of one of the most vulnerable groups will have in 2 to 3 weeks – all of them - a significant degree of immunity.And when you consider that the average age of Covid fatalities is in the 80sYou can see the importance of what we have already achieved.And that is why I believe that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation was right to draw up a programme aimed at saving the most lives the fastest.So by February 15th, as I said last night, the NHS is committed to offering a vaccination to everyone in the top four priority groups including older care home residents and staff, everyone over 70, all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable.And to help us with meeting this target we already have 595 GP-led sites providing vaccines, with a further 180 coming on stream later this week.We have 107 hospital sites – with a further 100 later this weekSo that is almost a thousand sites – vaccination sites - across the country by the end of this weekAnd next week we will also have 7 vaccination centres opening in places such as sports stadia and exhibition centres.We know that there will still be long weeks ahead in which we must persevere with these restrictionsbut I want to give you – the British people – the maximum possible transparency about this vaccine roll out with more detail on Thursday and daily updates from Monday so that you can see day by dayand jab by jabhow much progress we are making.Thanks very much I am now going to hand over to Chris to do the slides."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 December 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-address-to-the-nation-4-january-2021,Prime Minister,2020-12-30,"Prime Minister’s address to the nation: 4 January 2021Since the pandemic began last year, the whole United Kingdom has been engaged in a great national effort to fight Covid.And there is no doubt that in fighting the old variant of the virus, our collective efforts were working and would have continued to work.But we now have a new variant of the virus. It has been both frustrating and alarming to see the speed with which the new variant is spreading.Our scientists have confirmed this new variant is between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible – that means you are much, much more likely to catch the virus and to pass it on.As I speak to you tonight, our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic.In England alone, the number of Covid patients in hospitals has increased by nearly a third in the last week, to almost 27,000.That number is 40 per cent higher than the first peak in April.On 29 December, more than 80,000 people tested positive for Covid across the UK – a new record.The number of deaths is up by 20 per cent over the last week and will sadly rise further. My thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones.With most of the country already under extreme measures, it is clear that we need to do more, together, to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out.In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant.That means the Government is once again instructing you to stay at home.You may only leave home for limited reasons permitted in law, such as to shop for essentials, to work if you absolutely cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical assistance such as getting a Covid test, or to escape domestic abuse.The full details on what you can and can’t do will be available at gov.uk/coronavirus.If you are clinically extremely vulnerable, we are advising you to begin shielding again and you will shortly receive a letter about what this means for you.And because we now have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England must move to remote provision from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers.Everyone will still be able to access early years settings such as nurseries.We recognise that this will mean it is not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal. The Education Secretary will work with Ofqual to put in place alternative arrangements.We will provide extra support to ensure that pupils entitled to free school meals will continue to receive them while schools are closed, and we’ll distribute more devices to support remote education.I completely understand the inconvenience and distress this late change will cause millions of parents and pupils up and down the country.Parents whose children were in school today may reasonably ask why we did not take this decision sooner.The answer is simply that we have been doing everything in our power to keep schools open, because we know how important each day in education is to children’s life chances.And I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe for children – children are still very unlikely to be severely affected by even the new variant of Covid.The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households.Today the United Kingdom’s Chief Medical Officers have advised that the country should move to alert level 5, meaning that if action is not taken NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days.Of course, there is one huge difference compared to last year.We are now rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in our history.So far, we in the UK have vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe combined.With the arrival today of the UK’s own Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine, the pace of vaccination is accelerating.I can share with you tonight the NHS’s realistic expectations for the vaccination programme in the coming weeks.By the middle of February, if things go well and with a fair wind in our sails, we expect to have offered the first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.That means vaccinating all residents in a care home for older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70, all frontline health and social care workers, and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable.If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups, we will have removed huge numbers of people from the path of the virus.And of course, that will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have endured for so long.I must stress that even if we achieve this goal, there remains a time lag of two to three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity.And there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted.So we should remain cautious about the timetable ahead.But if our understanding of the virus doesn’t change dramatically once again…If the rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful…If deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect…And, critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules…Then I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers.I want to say to everyone right across the United Kingdom that I know how tough this is, I know how frustrated you are, I know that you have had more than enough of government guidance about defeating this virus.But now more than ever, we must pull together.You should follow the new rules from now, and they will become law in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Parliament will meet – largely remotely – later that day.I know that the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland share my conviction this is a pivotal moment and they’re taking similar steps.The weeks ahead will be the hardest yet but I really do believe that we are entering the last phase of the struggle.Because with every jab that goes into our arms, we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people.And, thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight and we know exactly how we will get there.But for now, I am afraid, you must once again stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Thank you all very much."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 December 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-30-december-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-12-23,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 December 2020Today I want to begin with the good news: the approval of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine which is a fantastic achievement for British scienceAnd which will allow us to vaccinate more people, and also vaccinate them more quickly.And there is one important development that’s helping us to accelerate our vaccination programme across the whole of the UK:We’ve had new advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationthat the first dose can protect people against the worst effects of this virusbecause the benefits kick in after two or three weeks.And so from now on we will give a first dose to as many vulnerable people as possible,with the second dose to follow twelve weeks later.And what that means is we can vaccinate and protect many more people in the coming weeks.I know everyone watching this will want to know when you can get your vaccineand all I want to say is we are working as hard and as fast as we can to get the supplies to you, and as soon as we have the supplies we will be getting them into people’s armsTo summarise where we areWe have to face the fact we’ve got two big things happening at once in our fight against Covid -One is working for us; and one working against us.On the plus side we have two valid vaccines and we are racing, as I say, to get them out.On the downside, there is a new strain of the virus which is spreading much faster and surging across the country.And we have seen a 40 per cent increase in cases in England in the last week alone,almost 15 per cent more patients in hospital – more than at the peak of the first wave.And yesterday sadly we recorded almost a thousand deaths across the UK, for the first time since April.So at this critical moment with the prospect of freedom within reachWe’ve got to redouble our efforts to contain the virus.That’s why the Health Secretary has announced that more areas of England will be moving into Tier 4 from tomorrowAnd as I say again, no-one regrets these measures more bitterly than I do.But we must take firm action nowand that’s why we have to think very hard about schools.Because today of course it remains the case that keeping children in education is a national priorityit remains the case that schools are safe.But we must face the reality that the sheer pace of the spread of this new variantrequires us now to take even tougher action in some areas and that does affect schoolsLet me set out for you what this means.In most of England, primary schools will still reassemble next week, as planned for the new term.But, in the areas we have just published today on gov.uk,I am afraid the start of the new term will be delayed until at least January 18,when the latest data on those infection rates will be reviewed.That is because the rate of transmission in these areas is so high,and there’s just such pressure on the local NHS,that extra action is required to control the spread of the virus.The children of key workers, or those who are considered to be vulnerable, will still go back to primary schools from next week – wherever they live in England.They are not affected by today’s announcement.In secondary schools, all vulnerable children and the children of critical workers will go back next week across England, as originally planned.But we will ask exam year pupils in secondary schools to learn remotely during the first week of termand return to the classroom from 11 January.The remaining secondary school pupils, i.e. non exam groups will go back a week later, that is from 18 January – but I want to stress that depending on the spread of the disease it may be necessary to take further action in their cases as well, in as I say the worst affected areas.To minimise disruption in schools and to fight the disease we are massively expanding our testing operationensuring that every secondary school pupil is tested as they return, and regularly thereafter.Again I want to thank the teachers, pupils and parents who have worked so hard to keep schools safe and keep them open.We are also asking universities to reduce the number of students who return to campus in January, prioritising medical courses and others requiring face to face teaching.And in all cases, students should be offered two rapid tests when they return.All of these measures are in the end designed to save lives and to protect the NHS.And for that very reason,I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow nightand see in the New Year safely at home.That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless they are in the same household or support bubble,and avoiding large gatherings of any kind.We are still in the tunnel of this pandemicthe light however is not merely visible:thanks to an extraordinary feat of British engineering if you likethe tunnel has been shortenedand we are moving faster through it, and that gives me great confidence about the future in the SpringSo for now let’s double our efforts, let’s follow the rules,protect our NHSand together make 2021 the year we leave this tunnel behind us."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 21 December 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/speech-on-coronavirus-restriction-tiers-vaccines-and-testing,Prime Minister,2020-12-21,"Health and Social Care Secretary’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 December 2020Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.I’m joined by Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins, the Chief Medical Advisor to Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace.We all know that 2020 has been a hard year.And it is ending in this festive period, which is going to be very different.After all the efforts that we’ve gone through to control this virus, and in many parts of the country, this virus is under control.Just as we’ve got a tiering system in place that was able to control this virus, we’ve discovered a new, more contagious virus, a variant which is spreading at a dangerous rate.And I know that the vast majority of people watching today and across the country understand what we need to do together to get through this.So today we’re announcing further action within the tiering system and also some further progress on vaccines and on testing.And I just wanted to say this before I set out the details of what we’re going to have to put in place: I know this action has consequences.And I know how difficult it is.But I also know that it is right to take the action that is necessary to control this virus.Across the country, cases have risen 57% in the last weekThe average daily COVID hospital admissions are 1,909 a day – that’s the highest figure since mid-April.There are 18,943 people in hospital right now, that’s almost as many as at the peak.And yesterday, 691 deaths from coronavirus were reported. That’s 691 people who have died just before Christmas. And our hearts go out to their families and loved ones as with all those that have died from this horrible disease.I know the pain this causes.So against this backdrop of rising infections, rising hospitalisations and rising number of people dying from coronavirus, it is absolutely vital that we act.We simply cannot have the kind of Christmas that we all yearn for.Of course, it’s the social contact that makes Christmas so special. But it is that social contact that the virus thrives on, and that’s how the virus has spread from one person to another.So it’s important that we all minimise our social contact as much as is possible this Christmas, and that will help protect ourselves, our loved ones and the whole country.We’ve got to keep our resolve. We’ve got to keep going through this.And there are 4 areas of our response that I want to update you on today very specifically.Local actionThe first are those tiering decisions that I’ve just mentioned.We know that the 3-tiered system worked to control the old variant, and is working now in large parts of the country, especially in Northern England.But, we also know that Tier 3 is not enough to control the new variant.That is not a hypothesis, it is a fact, and we’ve seen it on the ground.We have seen case rates rise in some of places close to where the current Tier 4 restrictions are, in places like East Anglia, where we’ve also detected a significant number of the new variant as we’ve seen case rates rise sharply.It is therefore necessary to put more of the East and South East of England into Tier 4.We are also taking action in parts of the South West, where there are some early signs of the new variant, and where cases are rising.Even though case rates in some of these areas are not as high as in some areas badly affected, in London for instance and in Kent, the direction is clear, and in many cases is quite stark.The doubling times are short.And we have learnt that when it’s a matter of when, not if we take action.It is better to act sooner.So, from one minute past midnight on Boxing Day, Sussex, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, those parts of Essex not yet in Tier 4, Waverley in Surrey, and Hampshire, including Portsmouth and Southampton, but with the exception of the New Forest, will be escalated to Tier 4.Bristol, Gloucestershire, Somerset, including the North Somerset Council area, Swindon, the Isle of Wight, New Forest and Northamptonshire, as well as Cheshire and Warrington, will be escalated to Tier 3.And I’m afraid Cornwall and Herefordshire have seen sharply rising rates and need to be escalated to Tier 2.This is not news that anybody wants to deliver.And I am truly sorry for the disruption that it causes.But I think people know how important it is that we take decisions like this to keep people safe and to protect the NHS.South AfricaThe second piece of new I want to tell you about is developments on another new strain of this virus.Of course, the fight against this virus is a global effort.And we are constantly vigilant and looking around the world.As part of our surveillance, and thanks to the impressive genomic capability of the South Africans, we have detected 2 cases of another new variant of coronavirus here in the UK.Both are contacts of cases who have travelled from South Africa over the past few weeks.The Chief Scientific Advisor and Chief Medical Officer and others met their South African counterparts over the last day.We are incredibly grateful to the South African Government for the rigour of their science, and the openness and the transparency with which they have rightly acted, as we did when we discovered the new variant here.This new variant is highly concerning, because it is yet more transmissible and it appeared to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered here.We have taken the following action.First, we are quarantining cases, and close contacts of cases, found here in the UK.Second, we are placing immediate restrictions on travel from South Africa.Finally, and most importantly, anyone in the UK who has been in South Africa in the past fortnight, and anyone who has been in close contact with anyone who has been in South Africa in the last fortnight, must quarantine immediately.By quarantine, I mean they must restrict all contact with any other person whatsoever.We will be changing the law to give this legal effect imminently.These measures are temporary, while we investigate this further new strain, which is currently being analysed at Porton Down.And I want to thank everyone involved for the seriousness with which I know they will take these instructions.TestingI’d like to now move onto some more positive developments.The third thing I wanted to talk about was an update on testing.As you know, we continue rapidly to expand testing capacity here in the UK.We are expanding community testing yet further in areas where the rate of infection is highestSo we can identify people, and especially to identify the around 1 in 3 people, who carry the virus without displaying any symptoms at all.116 local areas have now signed up for this community testing, and we are in discussion with more.These rapid turnaround tests are proving to be extremely effective at finding cases where we otherwise wouldn’t.And I am today publishing an assessment of the Liverpool community testing project, which shows how effective this can be.I would urge anyone who has the opportunity to take part to protect their local area.And at the same time we are boosting rapid testing in care homes, with a further £149 million to support that effort.So all those who work in care homes in England will receive 2 rapid tests a week, in addition to their weekly PCR test.VaccinesFinally, amid all this difficulty, the great hope for 2021 is of course the vaccine.The vaccine is our route out of all this.And, however tough this Christmas and this winter is going to be, we know that the transforming force of science is helping find a way through.I am delighted to be able to announce that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, developed here in the UK, has submitted its full data package to the MHRA for approval.This is the next step towards a decision on the deployment of the vaccine, which is already being manufactured including here in the UK.We are, of course, continuing to deploy the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which is being delivered now from over 500 sites all across the UK, and we are adding more all of the time and we are accelerating the rollout.I am also delighted to be able to announce that we have begun vaccination in care homes.We know that people who live in care homes are amongst those most vulnerable to this disease, and I’m delighted that we’re able to do this. It is another enormous logistical challenge, and I am very grateful to colleagues in the NHS and social care sector, who have worked so hard together to make this happen.This afternoon, it gives me great joy to tell you that the Chelsea Pensioners will be vaccinated, along with care home residents right across the country.I think we all need a bit of good news.And the reality is this vaccine programme is the we are going to get this.Because every time someone is vaccinated, our country becomes a little bit safer, they become a little bit safer and we get a little bit closer to the life that we all want to get back to.Achievements this yearAs I sincerely hope this is my last press conference before Christmas.I want to take a moment firstly to thank you, and everyone watching, for the sacrifices you’ve made.And I want to thank my whole team, who have done so much, including those here, including Susan and Jenny, but including the huge team in the NHS, in the Department and right across the board.As a country, we have been faced with the most enormous challenges, and it has been very tough.But I especially want to thank those who help this country to become the first in the world to roll out a clinically approved vaccine.I want to thank all those that have helped us build a bigger capacity genomic testing than anywhere else in the world – and of course the biggest testing capacity in Europe.I want to thank our scientist who discovered the first proven treatment for coronavirus.And I want to thank everybody working in the NHS and in social care for the work that they’ve done this year, and also for the work that’s going to carry on this winter.And especially to colleagues are going to work over Christmas, which of course is so important in the NHS and in social care.Look, I know how hard 2020 has been for everybody.And after delivering some really difficult news, if I may I want to end on a reflection about where we are as a country.This Christmas, and the start of 2021, is going to be tough.The new variant makes everything much harder, because it spreads so much faster.But we mustn’t give up now. We know that we can control this virus, we know that we can get through this together.We’re going to get through it by suppressing the virus, until a vaccine can make us safe, and that has been our strategy and that’s what we must do.And I know that we can do this. We’ve seen so much sacrifice.We’re not going to give up now, especially after so much sacrifice.I know that some of these decisions are tough.But I believe that everybody making the right decisions, and I believe that everybody will do what is needed to keep themselves and others safe, especially this Christmas.And I know from the bottom of my heart that there are brighter skies ahead."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 December 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-21-december-2020,Prime Minister,2020-12-16,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 21 December 2020Good afternoon,I want to update everyone on one thing and that’s what’s happening at our borders and especially at Dover.Last night at 11pm the French Government imposed restrictions on UK freight crossing to France when accompanied by a driver.And so today I chaired a meeting of the Government’s emergency, COBR committeein order to co-ordinate a UK-wide response.And it is vital first to stress that these delays– which are only occurring at Dover –only affect human-handled freight,and that is only 20 per cent of the total arriving from or departing to the European continent,which means the vast majority of food, medicines and other supplies are coming and going as normal.You may also be aware – in fact I’d be amazed if you weren’t –that the government has been preparing for a long time for this exactly kind of event.So working with the Kent Resilience Forum, Kent County Council and Highways England,we’ve activated our long-prepared plans,with the result that we have already been able to reduce the number of lorries waiting on the M20 from 500 to 170.The site at Manston Airfield is ready to cope with any overflow.And, of course, we are working with our friends across the Channel to unblock the flow of trade as fast as possible.The Government at all levels is communicating with our friends in ParisI have just spoken to President Macron - we had a very good call - we both understand each other’s positions and want to resolve these problems as fast as possible.I know that Grant is also speaking to his counterpart and we are working to a solution, as I say, as fast as we canto allow freight traffic to resume between the UK and France,and ensure that lorries can travel in both directions in a Covid-secure way.I want to stress that we in the UK fully understand the anxieties of our friends about Covid, their anxieties about the new variant,but it is also true that we believe the risks of transmission by a solitary driver sitting alone in the cab are really very low.And so we hope to make progress as fast as we possibly can.I want to repeat that these delays only apply to a very small percentage of food entering the UK,and as British supermarkets have said, their supply chains are strong and robust,so everyone can continue to shop normally.And to our international friends and partners I want to say very frankly:We understand your concerns,And I hope that everybody can see that as soon as we were briefed as a government of the fast transmissibility of this new strain at about 3.15pm on Friday afternoon,We lodged all the necessary information with the World Health OrganisationAnd we took prompt and decisive action the very next day to curb the spread of the variant within the UK.And we want to work with our colleagues, with our friends around the world, as we have from the beginning to develop new treatments and new vaccines.And today I can announce that half a million people in the UK have now received their first dose.As we’ve seen throughout this pandemic, this virus alas can move all too swiftly from one nation to another,But it is steadily being defeated by an international responseAn international response that is bringing the hope of vaccines to the entire world,And in that the UK will continue to play our full part.I’ll now handover to our Secretary of State, Grant."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 14 December 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-december-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-12-14,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 December 2020It is just a week since the United Kingdom began the biggest vaccination programme in our history.And the public is coming forward at an extraordinary pace to get a jab, to protect themselves,beginning with the elderly and the most vulnerable.With 138,000 recipients of the first dose – and more joining them every minute - there is no doubt we are winning and we will win our long struggle against this viruswhich makes it all the more important that we hold our nerve this winter.Because we are now in a race to protect us all while doing everything we can to keep the virus under control.And thanks to the colossal collective effort in Novemberwe did bring the R below 1we did get the infection rate down.But I must be frank with youwe are already seeing worrying rises in some parts of the country:Kent is still seeing rising infectionsthe number of cases in London is at 270 per 100,000 people.And that’s why we acted quickly by moving London into Tier 3 from today.And tomorrow the Health Secretary will announce the outcome of the latest tiering review.And so like every other European country facing similar challengeswe have come to this moment, a great global festivala turning point, a time of year that is of immense emotional and spiritual importance.But also a moment for us to exercise extreme cautionwhen we must remember that one of the most striking features of this virus is that it spreads invisibly from people who don’t even have symptomswhich is in fact around 1 in 3 of everyone infected.And that’s why from the beginning this virus has been so hard to fight and that’s why it’s so important to follow the rulesand why this Christmas it’s vital that everyone exercises the greatest possible personal responsibility.And having looked at the latest data – with our colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,we have decided that the overall situation is alas worse and more challenging than we had hoped when we first set the rules.So while it would not be right to criminalise people who have made plans and simply want to spend time with their loved ones,we are all collectively across the UK, governments at every level,asking you to think hard and in detail about the days aheadand whether you can do more to protect yourself and others.We are keeping the laws the same – but we all want to send the same message:a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas, and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas.When we say three households can meet on five days,I want to stress these are maximums, not targets to aim for.And of course it is always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet.And that means that if you are visiting others over Christmas,we are asking you – in the five days beforehand, as early as this Friday -to reduce the number of people you are in contact with to the lowest possiblebecause this virus spreads from human contact.If possible don’t travel from a high prevalence to a low prevalence areaand avoid staying away from home overnight if you can.Remember, the vaccine is on the way and our aim is to inoculate everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable or elderly in the early months of next year.So if you’re elderly, the best way to minimise your personal risk is to wait to be vaccinated before spending time indoors with others.And if you have an elderly relative, you might want to delay seeing them until they’ve been vaccinated.And whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day SalesAnd no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the New Year – remember the rules in your local area will apply.In most places across the UK, I’m afraid that means you cannot mix with other households indoors.All the information about how best to protect yourself and your loved ones is being made available on gov.uk.So have yourselves a merry little ChristmasAnd I’m afraid this year I do mean littleBut with the vaccine, and all the other measures that we are taking,We do know things will be better in this country by EasterAnd I’m sure that next year Christmas will be as normal for every family in the country."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 10 December 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-14-december-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-12-10,"Health and Social Care Secretary’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 14 December 2020Welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.Today I’m joined by Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty and Professor Kevin Fenton, Public Health England’s Regional Director for London.Sadly, the news on the spread of the virus is not good.The latest number of cases of coronavirus is rising once more.We’ve seen an increase of 14% in the last week and the number of patients admitted to hospital across the UK has risen again too.The average number of new cases reported each day is 18,023 which is up on last week.Today, there are 16,531 COVID patients in hospitals across the UK – which is also up.And sadly, on average each day over the past week 420 deaths have been reportedOnce again, the spread of this disease is not even across the country. There have been sharp rises in South Wales, London, Kent, Essex and parts of the East and South East of England.In some areas, the doubling time is now 7 days, this rise is amongst people of all age groups – not just school-age children.I’m particularly concerned by the rising rates amongst the over 60s, the number of people in hospital which is also rising. That’s even before that we factor in the increases in last week’s rates.And we know, through painful experience: more cases lead to more hospitalisations and sadly, more deaths.To think that this link and this chain is broken is wrong and dangerous.We’ve seen it time and time again elsewhere this year when cases rise, the pressure on hospitals mount. And so to then sadly, do the number of people who die from coronavirusTo stop this, we need to act fast.I can tell you that because of the testing and surveillance systems that we built, we’ve also identified a new variant of this virus which may be associated with the faster spread in some areas.We deal with this variant just like we do with all the others and this underlines how important it is for us to be vigilant.The vaccine is being rolled out – and it’s wonderful to see that tens of thousands of people have had their jabs, their first jabs and it’s also very good to see that the vaccine, as of today, is being rolled out by GPs in England and to care homes in Scotland.Help is on its way. But we’re not there yet.To control this deadly disease while the vaccine is being rolled out, we all have a role to play.Everyone should minimise their social contact, because that’s how we can control the spread of this disease.Turning to London and south and west Essex, and south Hertfordshire – in these areas we have seen sharp exponential rises in the past week we have taken swift and decisive action to protect the NHS and save lives even ahead of the formal review point on Wednesday.We must act now.So, from one minute from midnight on Wednesday morning these areas will move into Tier 3 – the very high alert level.I know this is not the news people wanted – it’s a blow to so many people who have made plans and to businesses that will be adversely affected too.But we know from experience: the best thing to do in the face of this virus is to act fast and not wait to see the growth continue.And we do not rule out further action.This rise in transmission – as well as the new variant of COVID – should be a warning to us all that – even after such a difficult year – we must stay vigilant.People of all ages can spread this disease and around 1 in 3 people don’t display any symptoms at all. But can still spread it.We should never lose sight of our own role in this – our personal responsibility.Each and every one of us to respect the rules where you are don’t ease up on those simple steps that keep us safe: like hands, face, and space. The social distancing that we need. And to come forward and get a test.This moment is a salutary warning for the whole country – this isn’t over yet.Please play your part and do all you can to stop the spread of this disease.I’ll now turn to Professor Whitty to turn to the data and the details.See coronavirus epidemiological data by local authority, the press release on London, South Essex, and South Hertfordshire moving to Tier 3 restrictions and Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock’s oral statement to the House of Commons about the coronavirus situation, vaccinations and new areas to be put into Tier 3."

The NHS was the first health care system in the world to roll out the vaccines for other deadly diseases like TB, measles, mumps and rubella, and meningitis C.So I’m so proud we can now add COVID-19 to that list.Before updating you on vaccine deployment, I’d like to go through the latest coronavirus data.The average number of new cases each day is now 16,236 – that has risen over the last week.Today, there are 15,242 COVID patients in hospital across the UK – which is slightly less than last week. And sadly, 516 deaths were reported yesterday.Vaccine deploymentThe fall in the number of cases has flattened off – and is rising in some parts of the country like Kent, Essex and some parts of London.It shows us this fight is far from over and how we must all play our part and stay on our guard, now and through Christmas.We’ve got help on the horizon and we can all see that with the vaccine – so don’t blow it now. And of course, this shows why the deployment of a vaccine is so important.I just want to take a moment to thank everyone involved in the vaccine rollout so far, which has been done with such professionalism and skill.And today I want to pay a special tribute and thank pharmacists, who are working with such a tricky vaccine. Must be kept cold at -70 degrees. They have done so much work to get ready for this moment at such pace.As of today, we are vaccinating in 73 hospitals across the UK. Tens of thousands of people have had the jab.I want to set out the next steps.I can confirm that we will shortly expand our vaccination programme further to 10 more locations in England and from next week we will begin vaccinations in GP-led sites and vaccinate in care homes by Christmas.We will keep on expanding this roll out to reach more and more people.As more vaccines come on stream, we will open vaccination centres in larger venues, like sports stadia and conference halls next year and that’s when most people can expect to get their jabs.When the time comes, the NHS will get in touch with you – so you don’t need to come forward and get in contact with the NHS.Get the jabOn Tuesday in Milton Keynes, it was great to meet some of the patients and the staff involved.And I loved what Barbara – who’s 82 – said. When she got her jab there she said: “I’d much rather get the vaccine than COVID-19 itself”.I’m with Barbara. It’s free according to need – and it’s the very best way to protect you and to protect those around you. And when enough people get vaccinated – and we see those hospitalisations coming down – we can then start lifting those restrictions which have made this year so tough.And I felt so proud when I sat with Muhammad Hassan, I sat with him while he got his jab. He’s a doctor at Milton Keynes Hospital who volunteered to treat COVID patients – and himself caught COVID in the first peak.He said the jab was painless.But we also talked about the challenges that we still face right now while we roll out the jab across the country.Protect the NHSEven with this mass vaccination programme, for the next few months, we will not have sufficient protection through the vaccination programme.This is always the most difficult time for the NHS anyway for the winter months.And with the number of cases flattening again, we’ve all got to do our bit and not put more pressure on the NHS.To do that, we must keep respecting the rules where we are and take those sensible steps that we can all take: washing our hands, covering our face and making space between people, respecting that social distancing and the rules that come with it.We can’t stop that now, just because the vaccine is here.And even if you’ve had the jab, you are not immune. The vaccine will not fully protect you until 7 days after you’ve received the second dose and we don’t yet know if it will stop you from passing on the disease to other people.So we all have to keep acting as if we still can pass it on. That is the safest way to get the number of cases down and keep people safe.London, Kent and EssexI’m particularly concerned about the number of cases in London, Kent and Essex.Cases are rising – and in many areas, already high.Looking into the detail, the testing results and surveys show us that by far the fastest rise is among secondary school age children, 11 to 18 year-olds while the rate among adults in London is broadly flat.But we know from experience that a sharp rise in cases in younger people can lead to a rise amongst more vulnerable age groups later. We’ve seen that happen before.So we need to do everything we can to stop the spread among school-age children in London right now.We must not wait until the review which will take place on the 16 December.We need to take targeted action immediately.Having spoken to the leaders of London’s councils, and to the mayor, we have decided to put in place an immediate plan for testing all secondary school aged children in the 7 worst affected boroughs of London, in parts of Essex that border London, and parts of Kent.We want to keep schools open, because that’s both right for education and right for public health.We are therefore surging mobile testing units and we will be working with schools and local authorities to encourage these children and their families to get tested over the coming days.More details will be set out tomorrow.And I want to urge all those involved to step forward for testing.It is important that 11 to 18 year-olds get tested in these boroughs irrespective of whether they have symptoms – this is a really important point, because we know that you can have COVID – and you can still pass it on – even without symptoms.Around 1 in 3 people with COVID have no symptoms at all but they can still pass it on to others.I know that nobody wants to be responsible for endangering those around them so I urge everyone involved to get a test.We surged testing in Leicester. We surged testing in Liverpool.We know that community testing can work and it requires a collective spirit of determination and resilience, and of people coming together to do the right thing. Something I have confidence that everybody involved will find in the days to come.This sort of community testing deployment is not just available in London, Kent and Essex, where cases are rising, but also across the country to help get cases coming down.We are now working with over 100 local authorities across England – and with the 3 devolved administrations – to help get cases down using community testing.This includes Manchester, Kirklees and Lancashire, who are planning to mobilise community-based testing in their areas before Christmas. As are Manchester and Kirklees.This offer remains available across the UK to be done in partnership with local authorities and devolved administrations.Test and Trace 2.0We can deploy this sort of massive testing, because of the work NHS Test and Trace have done so effectively to build our vast testing capacity.Our new NHS Test and Trace Business Plan, which we published today, sets out how we will grow this yet further.Today’s figures on testing and tracing show that – thanks to improvements in the way we do contact tracing – by reducing the number of repeat calls that are made to individual households, which has been one of the pieces of feedback that we’ve received, our contact tracing now reaches 86% of contacts, and that’s up from around 60% just a few weeks ago.I want to pay tribute to the contact tracing team, working under Dido Harding, for delivering on this very significant improvement.From today, I can confirm that people instructed to isolate by the COVID-19 app, and are eligible, can claim the £500 Test and Trace Support Payment directly through the app too.Hospital upgradesEven as we work to overcome these immediate challenges, I’m determined that we also lose no time in modernising our hospitals.Today, I can announce 1,800 projects, which are being funded from our £600 million package to upgrade and refurbish hospitals across 178 NHS trusts this year.This will include projects for fixing roofs, for new MRI machines. These projects, which will be completed over the winter period, will make a real difference for staff and patients alike and help our NHS build back better.CloseThese announcements that I’m making today show just what a massive effort is needed every day to tackle coronavirus even with the vaccine on the horizon.I’m very grateful to all those working in schools, local authorities, delivering the vaccine rollout, our pharmacists, NHS Test and Trace and the hospital improvement programme for the efforts that will be needed to deliver all of this.It shows that every part of our NHS – from GP surgeries to hospitals – and every part of government – local and national – is all playing its part in the battle against this virus.We’ve got to remember, in this battle, that we’re all on the same side.And, especially with Christmas coming, there’s something we all can do which is to respect the rules, and all of us, at all times, do all that we can to stop the spread of the virus.This is a marathon, not a sprint.We’ve got to keep going.The finish line is in sight.And I know that, together, we can get there."

Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 November 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-30-november-2020,Prime Minister,2020-11-26,"Coronavirus press conference (30 November 2020)Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street coronavirus briefing.I’m joined today by Professor Steve Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England, and General Sir Gordon Messenger, the Head of Operations for the Community Testing Programme.Tomorrow night, our national restrictions in England will come to an end and, subject to the vote in Parliament, we’ll return to the tiered system from Wednesday morning.I know that the national restrictions have been really tough for some people. But the good news is: they’ve been working.Let me take a moment if I may to run through the numbers.Today’s study from Imperial College shows that the national restrictions have brought down cases down by a third.Over the last week, the average number of positive tests is now 14,778 – down from a peak of 25,331 on 16 November.Today, there are 15,712 patients in hospital in the UK with coronavirus – that is down from 16,612 on 23 November a week ago.In England, in the week before the peak, the number of cases grew by 11% but in the last week, cases have dropped by 30%, almost a third.This is clearly good news – it shows the national restrictions have been successful.And what this means in practice is that – through everyone’s actions in respecting the national lockdown and through everything people have sacrificed – we’ve reduced pressures on the NHS, we’ve brought down the number of coronavirus cases, we’ve got this virus back under control.And I want to thank you for that and for the part that you’ve played.The effect of the action we take, of course, brings with it huge challenges too – especially for the hospitality sector.But as the analysis of health, economic and social effects of COVID-19 and the approach to tiering shows – which we’ve published today – it clearly demonstrates, this action is necessary to avoid a much worse outcome.And we must be vigilant. There are still 14,778 positive cases reported every day. There are still those 15,712 people in hospital with COVID.And, sadly, there are still 460 reported deaths, on average, each day. This is far too many.But there is light at the end of the tunnel. We know that, together, we can beat this – and we’ve got to stick at it.Putting this in technical terms, the R rate is back below 1 – but only just.When R is below 1, the number of infections falls over time, because on average, each infected person infects fewer than one other.And for that to happen on average, it’s important that lots of infected people, infect no one else at all.This is the central challenge of this pandemic and it’s made much much more difficult because about 1 in 3 people who have coronavirus have no symptoms at all, but nevertheless pass the infection on to others.And that’s why, even as we ease these national restrictions, we’ve got to keep some restrictions in place. Hence the tiering system.So while we can let up a little, we can’t afford to let up a lot.The success of our collective efforts means that, from Wednesday, everyone in England – even those in Tier 3 – can have some greater freedoms.But we don’t have much headroom. We can’t risk letting cases rise again – especially into Christmas and with the flu season around the corner.The Prime Minister has published the government’s COVID-19 Winter Plan which sets out the end to national restrictions and the steps we’ll take to help bring life back to normal by spring.But even as we take these steps forward, we must keep our resolve. We’ve worked so hard and collectively sacrificed so much. But we can get through this. And we know that hope is on the horizon.In the past fortnight we have made some really significant progress on vaccines and the NHS now stands ready to deploy a vaccine, should one be approved by the UK’s independent regulator.And today, Moderna, the American company, formally filed for the use of its vaccine in America. Moderna has already been submitting data to the MHRA, the UK’s regulator, for some time.And as we set out this weekend, we have secured 2 million further doses, meaning that we in the UK now have access to a total of 357 million doses of 7 different vaccines.And while we keep working on a vaccine, we have already built a huge testing capacity that we can deploy right now.I wanted to take a moment to talk through the next steps on testing.Since the start of the pandemic we’ve built the biggest testing capacity in Europe and it means we can use tests to do lots of things we couldn’t do before.In addition to our symptomatic testing programme and the rapid testing we are now deploying in the NHS and across social care, we have the capacity to do more.Today we begin the roll-out of our university student testing programme and expand community testing.And we won’t just test people with symptoms; because of this problem of asymptomatic transmission, people who don’t have symptoms but do have covid transmitting covid to others we’re going to test people who don’t have symptoms as well.This really matters, because by finding the positives, we can break the chain of transmission and stop other people catching covid.In Liverpool, where over 300,000 people – both with symptoms and without – where that testing has happened, they’ve managed to bring the case rates down by over three-quarters.And so on Wednesday Liverpool will go into Tier 2, not Tier 3.Of course, I want to see this sort of success right across the board so we’re rolling out community testing much more widely.We’ve been working with those areas going into Tier 3 with colleagues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland too.And today – with the publication of our community testing prospectus – we set out the next phase of that work to give Tier 3 areas a faster way out of the toughest restrictions, to support them to come down the tiers – as has happened in Liverpool.We’ve already received significant interest from around the country, including from the West Midlands, Redcar, Warwickshire and Medway and others.And this offer is available across all of the UK and will be delivered in partnership with local authorities in Tier 3 areas and devolved administrations throughout the country.Because by using tests that can turn results around in under 30 minutes we can identify and isolate people who have covid, including, crucially, the 1 in 3 people with covid, who don’t have any symptoms at all – but can nevertheless pass the infection on.Because you can have covid without symptoms and still infect others. That of course is a silent danger.You wouldn’t know that you’re risking lives around you.So, if you’re offered a test – please take it. You might just save a life.The final thing I wanted to say is that it is all of our responsibility to keep ourselves safe, to keep our families, our friends and our communities safe. That responsibility is on all of us.I know it weighs heavily – we’ve been carrying it for a long time now.But the light of dawn is on the horizon.It’s the moment to stand firm until the morning.So we can look back and see clearly: that everything we gave and everything we did, it was not for nothing but so we could save lives and build back better for everyone.I now want to turn to Professor Powis to take us through the latest numbers on the impact on the NHS."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 November 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-26-november-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-11-16,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 November 2020We now have reason to hope that by Spring, community testing and vaccines will combine to end this era of restrictions.But to get there we must first navigate a hard winter when the burden on our NHS is heaviest and the cold weather favours the virus.The data already suggests national measures in England have slowed - and in some places reversed - the growth of new cases.As more data comes in, we hope and expect to see those trends continue.Together we have prevented our NHS from being overwhelmed,but those dangers have not gone away.If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again,casting aside our hard won gains,and forcing us back into a New Year national lockdown with all the damage that would mean.The tough measures in our Winter Plan are the best way to avoid this outcome.All our friends around the world are grappling with the same question of how to keep people safe without retreating into a winter of hibernation.In Italy there is a nightly curfew,in Germany, hospitality will remain closed until 20th December,and in France, until 20 January.Across the whole of the UK, measures remain in place to control the virus.Under our Winter Plan, England will return to a tiered system of local restrictions.Our decisions on which area enters which tier are based on public health advice according to five indicators:cases across all ages,especially the over 60s,the rate by which cases are rising or fallingthe percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covidand the pressure on the NHS.We are publishing data packs setting out the reasons behind decisions in each area.To find out how this affects you, log on to gov.uk where all the information is available.I’m sorry to confirm that, from Wednesday, most of England will be in the top two tiers with the toughest measures.I know this will bring a great deal of heartache and frustration, especially for our vital hospitality sector,our pubs, our restaurants, our hotels, in so many ways the soul of our communities -which continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden.I really wish it were otherwise, but if we are to keep schools open – as we must - then our options in bearing down on the disease are necessarily limited.What we will do is continue taking every possible step to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK.These tougher tiers strike a balance – they are sufficient to continue driving the virus downwards but it’s important to recognise they are less intrusive than the current national measures.In all tiers, shops, gyms and the leisure sector, hairdressers, other forms of personal care, places of worship will reopen.You will no longer be instructed to stay at home, though you should continue to work from home if you can.The rule of 6 will once again apply in public outdoor spaces and organised outdoor sport can begin again.But there is no doubt that the restrictions in all tiers are tough – and I am sorry about that.While the data is beginning to improve, the virus is still prevalent, and the faster we drive it down the faster we can lift restrictions.And that is exactly what these new tiers are designed to achieve.While the previous tiers slowed the spread of the virus,they were never quite enough to cut the R below 1 and keep it there,so areas did not escape whatever level they were placed in.Our new approach is designed to reduce R below 1,opening a path for areas to move down the scale, as soon as the situation improves.And crucially, we now have the means to accelerate that moment of escape with rapid community testing,allowing anyone carrying the disease - including those without symptoms – to isolatethereby reducing the R.And the truth is that at least one in three people with Covid have no symptoms at all and may be spreading the disease without even knowing that they’ve got it.The only way to identify them and protect everyone is through mass testing.Liverpool shows what can be achieved.In Liverpool, in the space of two and a half weeks, over 240,000 tests have been conductedand together with the effect of national restrictions,this has helped to reduce the number of cases in Liverpool City Region by more than two thirds.So having previously been in tier 3, Liverpool City Region and Warrington will now be in tier 2.This is a success story which we want other parts of the country to replicateso we will work with local government, public health leaders and our fantastic Armed Forces,to offer community testing to tier 3 areas as quickly as possible,opening the way for them to follow Liverpool’s example.Testing on this scale is untried, but in due course, if it works, where people test negative, it may also be possible for families and communities to be released from certain restrictionseven if their home area stays in tier 3.The allocation of tiers will be reviewed every fourteen days, starting on 16 December.So your tier is not your destiny.Every area has the means of escape.And I have no doubt that together we can get through this Winter,suppress the virus until vaccines come to our aid,and then reclaim our lives and all the things that we love."
Business Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 12 November 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-november-2020,Business Secretary,2020-11-12,"Health and Social Care Secretary statement on coronavirus 16 November 2020Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street coronavirus briefing.I’m joined today by Professor Jonathan Van Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Office and Dr Susan Hopkins, the Chief Medical Advisor to NHS Test and Trace.Before we talk about testing and vaccines, I’d like to update you on the latest coronavirus data.The average number of new cases each day is now 25,329 up from 22,443 last week.There are today 14,915 COVID-19 patients in hospital across the UK, compared to 13,025 a week ago.And, sadly, yesterday 168 deaths were reported.This means that in the last week we’ve seen an average of 413 deaths, up from 332 a day a week ago.My profound sympathies are with everyone who’ve lost a loved one throughout this pandemic. These numbers make painfully clear, this virus remains a potent threat. And that threat is not just to the oldest and most vulnerable but to anyone, of any age, and of any background.We have already seen the serious impact that long COVID can have on peoples’ quality of life, even the fit and the young. Symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness, muscle pain, and neurological problems long after they first had the virus.We know that long COVID affects thousands of people, many thousands of people. We have already opened long COVID clinics in many parts of the country. And I am very pleased to be able to confirm that the NHS will have a network of 40 long COVID clinics right across England in place by the end of the month.They will bring together doctors, nurses, therapists and other NHS staff like physios to help those suffering with the long-term effects of coronavirus. Long COVID shows that this virus can strike us all, and we must all do our bit to strike back by following the rules and denying the virus the connections that it needs to spread.I know that this has not been easy and that it has meant celebrating Diwali or commemorating the fallen in ways that have been different this year from what we might normally do.I want to say thank you to everyone for their patience. We must persevere and get this virus under control. Coronavirus is not a short term problem that can easily be fixed. We must focus on the long term solutions, underpinned by the best possible science that can see us through this crisis and also lay firm foundations for the future.Testing capacityThis includes our ability to test at scale. We’re constantly improving our response, to bring the confidence that high-quality testing can provide. We’ve already built the largest coronavirus testing capacity in Europe.Up from 2,000 tests a day in March, to our current capacity of more than half a million. But we will not rest, because testing capacity helps keep people safe and can help us get things back more like normal life.Today I am delighted that we can announce two new mega labs, which will open early in the new year. They will add another 600,000 capacity to our daily capacity, that doubles the current capacity. They will also create 4,000 jobs. Crucially, they will represent a permanent part of the UK’s new diagnostics industry.We didn’t enter this crisis with a major diagnostics industry, and so together we have built one. Both to help beat the virus by testing more people and returning results more quickly and to give our country a permanent defence that we need for any future epidemic.And to improve our care for so many other diseases, like heart disease or cancer or flu.I am absolutely determined that we must have a massive diagnostics capacity, not just for this pandemic, but long into the future.More capacity also speeds up turnaround times but speeding up turnaround times isn’t just about the test, it is also about the logistics.So I want to take one moment to thank the Royal Mail, who, from this weekend, will empty some of their post boxes 7 days a week to speed up home testing. It is a big team effort and I am very grateful for our posties for playing their part to help keep people safe.This expansion of testing matters because it helps protect people. I just want to touch on some of the reasons why it matters.It means we can test the most vulnerable, and those who care for the most vulnerable, and we can test them more frequently.Over the last week, for instance we have delivered more than 3 million tests to NHS staff, to begin their regular bi-weekly testing.And today I know so many people have been relieved to hear that we have started a pilot for testing visitors in care homes, to use tests to allow people to visit loved ones in care homes in a way that keeps them safe and bring back some of those magical moments of social contact.Our expansion of testing also means we can roll out mass testing further.We are making progress in the city wide testing across Liverpool and we are now rolling out this localised approach to other areas.83 local authorities have now signed up to receive regular batches of these new lateral flow tests, which can allow for results in minutes.This is an important step and it combines the local insight of the brilliant Directors of Public Health right across the country with our strong national infrastructure of NHS Test and Trace combining to keep our communities safe.VaccinesI also want to turn to vaccines. While we don’t yet have a vaccine, we can now have hope.You may have heard the two promising pieces of news from earlier today.First, Janssen’s Phase 3 clinical trials are beginning today in 17 sites across the country, including Southampton, Dundee, Cardiff and Belfast.It’s the third vaccine to enter clinical trials here and should the trials come good, and that is by no means certain, and it can be proved to be safe and effective. We have 30 million doses on order by the middle of next year.Finally, you will no doubt have seen the excellent news that Moderna have today announced results from their preliminary trial data, suggesting that their vaccine has an effectiveness of 94.5 per cent. This is another encouraging step forward, although I stress that this is preliminary.The safety data is limited and their production facilities are not yet at scale.Should this latest vaccine be approved, the doses would be available from spring next year.And I can announce that we have today secured an initial agreement for 5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine.It is a similar RNA technology to Pfizer/BioNTech, of which we have already ordered 40 million doses, which should that be proved to work will come on stream potentially at the end of this year.Across diagnostics and vaccines, great advances in medical science are coming to the rescue. And while there is much uncertainty, we can see the candle of hope.And we must do all that we can to nurture its flame but we are not there yet.Until the science can make us safe, we must remain vigilant and keep following the rules that we know can keep this virus under control.Now I’d like to hand over to Dr. Hopkins to say more about our work on mass testing."

I am joined today by Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS EnglandThe average number of new cases each day is now 22,524, compared to 22,398 a week ago.There are now 14,196 COVID-19 patients in hospital across the UK, compared to 12,406 a week ago.1,219 patients are now in mechanical ventilation beds, compared to 1,142 a week ago.And, sadly, another 595 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported yesterday.The 7 day average daily number of deaths each day in the UK within 28 days of positive test by date reported is now 375, up from 295 a week ago.Our thoughts are very much with the families and loved ones of those who’ve lost their lives.Which is a reminder to us, as to why we are taking the action we are, to stop the spread of this virus and ultimately save lives.Today, we are also reminded about the vital importance of fighting this virus to protect our economy.Whilst the economy grew by 15% in the third quarter, it slowed in September and remains 8.2% below where we were in February.We in government understand acutely the human impact this statistic represents.It’s jobs, livelihoods, and families affected.So we will continue to support businesses now, and as they recover.The government has provided unprecedented levels of support for businesses over the past 8 months.To date, that represents over £200 billion in support.This is one of the most generous and comprehensive packages of financial support provided in the world, which the International Monetary Fund has praised.Just this month we have announced an extension of the self-employed grant scheme to March next year.An extension of the furlough scheme, at 80% until the spring.Cash grants of up to £3,000 per month for businesses in England, which are required to be closed due to this month’s national restrictions.These will benefit 600,000 business premises.And I can confirm today that we will be distributing £2.2 billion to local authorities tomorrow, to allow them to make these vital grant payments to businesses which have been affected.All of these measures are designed to preserve jobs and help businesses stay afloat.Today, we have also announced that more than 19,000 jobs have been created so far through our Kickstart Scheme.These jobs are spread across the country and in a variety of sectors.I know how hard this job market is, particularly for young job seekers, hoping to enter the workplace for the first time.The Kickstart Scheme is a ray of hope for young people, and I want to thank all the businesses which have stepped up to participate in this scheme.I speak to businesses everyday, and I can see, that despite the tough times, they are determined to soldier through this.Through sheer hard work, innovation, resilience and invoking a real community spirit across the United Kingdom.For example, in Aberdeenshire, Brewdog has made hand sanitiser to protect our front-line NHS staff.In Belfast, Axial3D has helped to develop thousands of new ventilators.In Surrey, Carousel Lights have adapted their manufacturing process to produce ‘sneeze screens’ for GP surgeries, pharmacies, and care homes.In Caerphilly, Transcend Packaging has converted production lines to create PPE, almost doubling their workforce in just four months.Because, despite the government’s support, and when it comes down to it, it is you who are keeping this country going.You who are powering our economic recovery.Just as our brilliant scientists and researchers are powering ahead in the race to discover a safe and effective vaccine.A little over 6 months ago, I stood here and announced the creation of the Vaccines Taskforce.A team of industry experts, scientists and civil servants, with one mission: to secure a vaccine to beat down this virus.Since then, they have secured access to 350 million doses, through agreements on 6 of the leading candidates in the world.The Taskforce has demonstrated how we can work together at pace.Business and science, the NHS and local communities, together forging a path out of this predicament.But, although this week’s announcement on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is potentially very good news, we still have a lot of hurdles to overcome before we can be certain of its safety and efficacy.And so we must ensure that we continue to follow the guidance.To protect our loved ones, our families, our friends, our communities.Because the virus is still here. It is still a danger.So we must not lose our resolve now.We must keep focused.To protect the health of the nation and the health of the economy.Working together, supporting each other, we will get through this.We will come out the other side stronger, more resilient and more united.Thank you."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 November 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-9-november-2020,Prime Minister,2020-11-05,"PM statement on coronavirus 9 November 2020Across the country and around the world this evening,people are asking one question about our fight against Covid,does the news of progress towards a vaccine – that’s been announced today - mean we are at the beginning of the end of our troubles?So, let me set out our assessment.The Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine has been tested on over 40,000 volunteers and interim results suggest it is proving 90 per cent effective at protecting people against the virus.But we haven’t yet seen the full safety data,and these findings also need to be peer-reviewed.So we have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go before we know the vaccine can be used.What I can say is that if and when this vaccine is approved, we, in this country, will be ready to start using it.Earlier this year the UK Government ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine – enough for about a third of the population, since you need two doses each.That puts us towards the front of the international pack on a per capita basis – and I should add we’ve ordered over 300 million doses from 5 other vaccine candidates as well.If the Pfizer vaccine passes all the rigorous safety checks and is proved to be effective then we will begin a UK-wide NHS led programme of vaccine distribution.We will decide the order in which people are offered the vaccination taking account of recommendations from a group of scientific experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.They’re looking at a range of factors, including the different characteristics of different types of vaccines, to work out the most effective way to protect as many people as possible and save as many lives as we can.And we will be setting out more detail about that in due course.But – and you know I am going to say this -I must stress, these are very, very early days.We have talked for a long time, or I have, about the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hillAnd tonight that toot of the bugle is louder.But it is still some way off.And we absolutely cannot rely on this as a solution.The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at such a critical moment.On Friday, SAGE reported that the R is above 1 in England – though this does not take into account the current national restrictions.Alas, the death figures are tragically rising, running at an average of over 300 a day – sadly double where they were 24 days agoThe number of Covid patients in hospital has risen from just over 10,000 two weeks ago to nearly 13,000 on 5 November,and we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak.Irrespective of whether there is a vaccine on the way or notwe must continue to do everything possible right now to bring the R down.And that is why we hope and believe that mass testing will help.Our first pilot began in Liverpool on Friday, in partnership with Liverpool City Council.We’ve tested thousands of people there but there are still a lot more to do, so please if you are in Liverpool, get yourself along to a testing centre – there are 19 at the moment with more still to come.The more people get tested the better we can protect that great city, and drive the disease down in Liverpoolso do it for your friends, for your relatives, for your community.And I want to thank the fantastic support of the army, the people of Liverpool and Liverpool City Council.And we are now going further by sending out hundreds of thousands of rapid lateral flow tests to local authorities right across England - and also of course to the Devolved Administrations.We’re also working with universities to establish, as soon as possible, similar mass testing capacity for students up and down the country.But while we are making progress this project is still in its infancy.And neither mass testing nor progress on vaccines –both vital arrows in our epidemiological quiver, both key parts of our fight against Covid - are at the present time a substitute for the national restrictions, for social distancing, for hand hygiene and all the rest.So it is all the more important to follow the rules.I know it’s been a tough first weekend of these Autumn restrictionsand I’m especially grateful to the Royal British Legion and all those who worked so hard to ensure that no virus would stop us yesterday from honouring the memory of those who gave their lives for our freedom.But we must get through this to 2nd December, when these measures expire and we plan to move forward with a tiered approach.Remember the basics, hands, face, space,and the follow the rules,that is how we can together protect our NHS, save lives and get this virus back in its box.And that is what we will do.So thank you.And I’m now going to hand over to Brigadier Fossey to talk about how the unrivalled logistical expertise of the British army that’s helping to deliver mass testing to Liverpool."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 31 October 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-november-2020,Prime Minister,2020-10-31,"PM statement on coronavirus 5 November 2020Good evening everyone,Across the whole United Kingdom, people are engaged in a huge joint effort to put the coronavirus back in its box.Throughout the pandemic, this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods – in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.We have put in place an unprecedented package of economic support, protecting the wages and jobs of millions of people.We have built the largest testing capacity in Europe, with 32 million tests conducted so far and over half a million tests now available every day across the UK.We have ensured that, as we head into winter, the NHS has at its disposal over 30,000 ventilators and billions of items of Personal Protective Equipment, most of it now manufactured here in the UK.Across the whole of the UK, we have a shared goal – to suppress the virus, ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed, and in doing so to save lives.The UK Government and the devolved administrations are working together on a joint approach to the Christmas period, because all of us want to ensure families can come together wherever they live.The challenges we face are significant across the U.K.The average number of new cases each day is now 22,398, that’s up from 9,716 a month earlier.There are now 12,320 patients in hospital, up from 2,602 a month earlier.1,142 patients are now in mechanical ventilation beds, up from 369 a month earlier.Sadly 492 deaths were reported yesterday. The weekly average number of deaths each day is now 295, up from 53 a month earlier.That’s why new restrictions are in place in each part of the UK.In England, from today, we are once again asking you to stay at home.As I explained on Saturday you can only leave home for specific reasons: for work if you can’t work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies.The full rules, all of the details, are available at gov.uk/coronavirus and on the NHS Covid-19 app – please log on to see what you can and can’t do.I know how tough this is:For staff in the NHS and care homes, who are facing a tough winter on the frontline.For families, who can’t meet in the way they would want to.For businesses, forced to shut just as you are getting back on their feet.I know many of you are anxious, weary and quite frankly fed up with the very mention of this virusBut I want to assure you this is not a repeat of the spring.Schools, universities and nurseries are all staying open.And these measures though they are tough are time-limited.The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact.So these rules will expire, and on 2 December we plan to move back to a tiered approach.There is light at the end of the tunnel.We have better treatments and techniques to take care of those in hospital, thanks largely to the ingenuity of British scientists.Rapid testing is being rolled out on a massive scale – with city-wide testing starting tomorrow in Liverpool.I am hugely grateful to the people of Liverpool for their participation in this pilot. I hope that by working together, we can get that great city on top of the virus.More broadly, there is also the very real chance of safe and effective vaccines.So taking those things together, these scientific advances can show us the way ahead.And in the meantime, the government will continue to support people affected by these new restrictions.As you know, we have protected almost 10 million jobs through furlough, and as the Chancellor announced earlier today, we are now extending the scheme through to March.We are also extending our support for the self-employed, so that the next payment increases to 80 per cent of average profits.We’re providing cash grants for businesses who are closed, worth more than £1 billion every month.We are giving £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England to support businesses.And a further £2 billion of funding is guaranteed for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.As we face these challenges together, we must look after those in most need.As of September we have helped over 29,000 rough sleepers off the streets, two thirds of whom are now in settled accommodation.Today we’re announcing a further £15 million to help councils offer safe accommodation for people who are sleeping rough or at risk of becoming homeless. This programme will help areas that need additional support most during the restrictions and throughout the winter.These are difficult times.And while it pains me to have to ask once again for so many to give up so much, I know that, together, we can get through this.So please, for the next four weeks, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.I’ll now hand over to the Head of NHS England Simon Stevens who’s going to talk about the NHS’s preparations for winter."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 October 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-31-october-2020,Prime Minister,2020-10-22,"Good evening and apologies for disturbing your Saturday evening with more news of Covid and I can assure you I wouldn’t do it unless it was absolutely necessary.First I will hand over to Chris and then Patrick who will present the latest data.Data PresentationThank you very much Patrick, and Chris. I am afraid that no responsible PM can ignore the message of those figures.When I told you two weeks ago that we were pursuing a local and a regional approach to tackling this virus, I believed then and I still believe passionately that it was the right thing to do.Because we know the cost of these restrictions, the damage they do, the impact on jobs, and on livelihoods, and on people’s mental health.No one wants to be imposing these kinds of measures anywhere.We didn’t want to be shutting businesses, pubs and restaurants in one part of the country, where incidence was very low, when the vast bulk of infections were taking place elsewhere.Our hope was that by strong local action, strong local leadership, we could get the rates of infection down where the disease was surging, and address the problem thereby across the whole country.And I want to thank the millions of people who have been putting up with these restrictions in their areas for so long. I want to thank local leaders who have stepped up and local communities.Because as you can see from some of those charts, the R has been kept lower than it would otherwise have been, and there are signs that your work has been paying offAnd we will continue as far as we possibly can to adopt a pragmatic and local approach in the months aheadBut as we’ve also seen from those charts, we’ve got to be humble in the face of natureAnd in this country alas as across much of Europe the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst case scenario of our scientific advisersWhose models as you’ve just seen now suggest that unless we act we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a dayA peak of mortality alas far bigger than the one we saw in AprilEven in the South West, where incidence was so low, and still is so low, it is now clear that current projections mean they will run out of hospital capacity in a matter of weeks unless we act.And let me explain why the overrunning of the NHS would be a medical and moral disaster beyond the raw loss of lifeBecause the huge exponential growth in the number of patients – by no means all of them elderly, by the way – would mean that doctors and nurses would be forced to choose which patients to treatWho would get oxygen and who wouldn’tWho would live and who would die,And doctors and nurses would be forced to choose between saving covid patients and non-covid patientsAnd the sheer weight of covid demand would mean depriving tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of non-covid patients of the care they needIt is crucial to grasp this that the general threat to public health comes not from focusing too much on covid, but from not focusing enough, from failing to get it under controlAnd if we let the lines on those graphs grow in the way they could and in the way they’re projected to grow, then the risk is that for the first time in our lives, the NHS will not be there for us and for our familiesAnd even if I could now double capacity overnight – and obviously I am proud that we have massively increased capacity, we do have the Nightingales, we’ve got 13,000 more nurses now than last year, we have many more doctors – but it still would not be enough, because the virus is doubling faster than we could conceivably add capacityAnd so now is the time to take action because there is no alternative.From Thursday until the start of December, you must stay at home.You may only leave home for specific reasons, including:For education;For work, say if you cannot work from home;For exercise and recreation outdoors, with your household or on your own with one person from another household;For medical reasons, appointments and to escape injury or harm;To shop for food and essentials;And to provide care for vulnerable people, or as a volunteer.I’m afraid non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues will all be closed – though click and collect services can continue and essential shops will remain open, so there is no need to stock up.Pubs, bars, restaurants must close except for takeaway and delivery services.Workplaces should stay open where people can’t work from home – for example in the construction or manufacturing sectors.Single adult households can still form exclusive support bubbles with one other household, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated.If you are clinically vulnerable, or over the age of 60, you should be especially careful to follow the rules and minimise your contacts with others.I know how tough shielding was, and we will not ask people to shield again in the same way again. However we are asking those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to minimise their contact with others, and not to go to work if they are unable to work from home.I am under no illusions about how difficult this will be for businesses which have already had to endure hardship this year. I am truly, truly sorry for that.This is why we are also going to extend the furlough system through November. The furlough scheme was a success in the spring. It supported people and businesses in a critical time. We will not end it. We will extend it until December.There will be some differences compared to March.These measures above all will be time-limited, starting next Thursday 5 November. They will end on Wednesday 2 December, when we will seek to ease restrictions, going back into the tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends.Christmas is going to be different this year, very different, but it is my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now, we can allow families across the country to be together.My priority, our priority, remains keeping people in education - so childcare, early years settings, schools, colleges and universities will all remain open. Our senior clinicians still advise that school is the best place for children to be.We cannot let this virus damage our children’s futures even more than it has already. I urge parents to continue taking their children to school and I am extremely grateful to teachers across the country for their dedication in enabling schools to remain open.And it is vital that we will keep provision for non-Covid healthcare groups going.So please - this is really important - unless your clinicians tell you otherwise, you should continue to use the NHS, get your scans, turn up for your appointments and pick up your treatments. If at all possible, we want you to continue to access these services, now and through the winter. Indeed it’s only by taking this action that we can protect the NHS for you.On Monday I will set out our plans to parliament. On Wednesday, parliament will debate and vote on these measures which, if passed, will as I say come into force on Thursday.We have updated the devolved administrations on the action we are taking in England and stand ready to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond.We should remember we are not alone in what we’re going through. Our friends in Belgium, France and Germany have had to take very similar action.So as we come together now to fight this second wave, I want to say something about the way aheadBecause people will reasonably ask when will this all endAnd as I have said before I am optimistic that this will feel very different and better by the springIt is not just that we have ever better medicine and therapies, and the realistic hope of a vaccine in the first quarter of next yearWe now have the immediate prospect of using many millions of cheap, reliable and above all rapid turnaround testsTests that you can use yourself to tell whether or not you are infectious and get the result within ten to 15 minutesAnd we know from trial across the country in schools and hospitals that we can use these tests not just to locate infectious people but to drive down the diseaseAnd so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround testsApplying them in an ever-growing number of situationsFrom helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when they’re giving birth to testing whole towns and even whole citiesThe army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of daysWorking with local communities, local government, public health directors and organisations of all kinds to help people discover whether or not they are infectious, and then immediately to get them to self-isolate and to stop the spreadAnd I can tell you tonight that the scientists may be unanimously gloomy about the immediate optionsBut they are unanimously optimistic about the medium and the long term futureWe will get through this – but we must act now to contain this autumn surgeWe are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and AprilIt is less prohibitive and less restrictiveBut from Thursday the basic message is the sameStay at home. Protect the NHS. And save lives."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 20 October 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-october-2020,Prime Minister,2020-10-20,"PM statement on coronavirus 22 OctoberI am very glad to be joined today not just by Sir Patrick Vallance but by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak who is going to tell us more in a moment about our latest package to help this country in its battle with Covid.And I want to thank Rishi for measures that will protect people’s livelihoods and protect jobs and which will help us to deliver our overwhelming objective of getting the virus under control while keeping pupils in education and keeping the UK economy moving forward.I know that there are some people who will say that this economic objective is so important that we should stop all measures to control the virus and stop restrictions of any kind on our social lives or on the way we run our businesses.We can’t do that because alas the maths is inescapable. We would face many thousands more deaths.And no, to answer one commonly posed question, we would not be able to insulate the elderly and the vulnerable. Not in a society with so many multigenerational households. No country has been able to do that.And an uncontrolled expansion in the number of Covid patients would mean that the NHS would have even less capacity to treat heart patients and cancer patients and to deal with all our other medical needs.So that’s why we reject that extreme laissez-faire approach.And then there are others who say on the contrary that we need now to lock the whole place down from John O’ Groats to Lands’ End.Turn the lights out, shut up shop. Close schools and universities and go back to the same kind of lockdown we had in March and April and May.And I have to say I don’t believe that is the right course now. Not when the psychological cost of lockdown is well known to us and the economic cost.Not when it is being suggested that we might have to perform the same brutal lockdown again and again in the months ahead.And not when there is such obvious variation – unlike last time – between different parts of the country.So that’s why we are going for a balanced approach.A middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus.A regional and local approach - the same approach that is now being followed by some of the countries that are the most successful in their fights against the virus.And so to all those who are enduring these restrictions, and who have been enduring them for so long in all parts of the country.I want to repeat my thanks, for your bravery, for your patience and your public spiritedness.And I repeat – there are clear signs that our collective actions are working.Yes the R is above one, but thanks to the efforts of people of all ages in following the guidance and the rules the R is about half its natural rate.And if we follow the guidance together and follow the rules then we can get it down.And it is precisely because these measures are burdensome that from the beginning this government has provided unprecedented support to everyone in this country –  support worth £200bn to look after jobs and livelihoods and business.And as we adjust our campaign to fight the virus it is right that we should now produce a new package of support across the country in addition to the specific agreements we have reached with Lancashire, Merseyside and others.And because it is far, far better to keep business going now rather than to let those jobs go forever in a new national lockdown.We will win this fight against Covid.Because we can see that treatments are getting better, and medicines are getting better and testing technologies are getting better.And we have shown before that we can drive the R down.And in the meantime we need to protect jobs, protect livelihoods, and put the UK in strongest position for an economic recovery.I am now going to hand over to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 12 October 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-20-october-2020,Prime Minister,2020-10-12,"PM statement at the coronavirus press conference on 20 OctoberGood afternoon,Across the world, the countries most successful in their fight against coronavirus are adopting regional and local measures to protect their populations.That is why last week we launched the three Local COVID Alert Levels for England, with interventions based on the prevalence of the virus in local areas.Since then we have been undertaking discussions with local leaders in those parts of the country which are currently bearing the brunt of the second wave of this epidemic.Before I update you on those discussions, I will ask Jonathan Van-Tam to brief us on the latest data nationally and in Greater Manchester.Thank you very much JVT.That presentation you’ve just seen shows you clearly why we must act.Now I don’t want anyone to think their actions or efforts have been in vain.Our collective action, across the country, has brought the R number well below its natural rate of about 3.As a result, the virus is not spreading as quickly as it did in February and March.However, while the R is below its natural level, it does remain above 1, meaning the virus continues to spread.So, we need to take action to reduce the R and control the virus, especially in those parts of the country, as you’ve just seen, where the virus is most prevalent.This evening, informed by the data we have just seen, I can announce that Greater Manchester will move to the Very High alert level.This means that:Pubs and bars must close, unless they are serving substantial meals.  Households can’t mix indoors or in most outdoor settings.  In some public outdoor spaces, groups must be limited to the rule of six.  And we strongly advise against travel into and out of the area.In line with the additional measures taken in Lancashire, casinos, bingo halls, betting shops, adult gaming centres and soft play areas must also close.Regulations will be laid in Parliament on Thursday and come into force just after midnight.I know that these restrictions are tough, both on businesses and individuals. And believe me no one wants to be putting these things into effect. But that is why we are putting in place a comprehensive package of support:The Job Support Scheme ensures those affected by business closures are still paid. And once you top that up with Universal Credit, those on low incomes will receive at least 80% of their normal income.  We have made available up to £465 million to help local authorities implement and enforce restrictions. Greater Manchester will receive £22 million of this.  And that’s on top of the extra £1 billion of extra funding we are providing for all local authorities across the country.  We will work with local authorities to allocate testing and introduce local contact tracing.Over the last 10 days, we have sought to agree an approach with local leaders in Greater Manchester. Unfortunately, agreement wasn’t been reached.And I do regret this. As I said last week, we would have a better chance of defeating the virus if we work together.In addition I must say, to the support outlined above, we made a generous and extensive offer to support Manchester’s businesses. This offer was proportionate to the support we have given Merseyside and Lancashire, but the Mayor didn’t accept this unfortunately.And given the public health situation, I must now proceed with moving Greater Manchester, as I say, to the Very High alert level.Because not to act would put Manchester’s NHS, and the lives of many of Manchester’s residents, at risk.Despite the failure to reach an agreement, I hope the Mayor and council leaders in Greater Manchester will now work with us to implement these measures.Elsewhere, discussions on moving to the Very High alert level continue with local leaders in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and the North East.I hope and expect central and local government will continue to work closely together, as we are seeing in Merseyside, Lancashire, London and many other parts of the country.Because – ultimately – all of us want to protect the NHS, and in doing so to save lives."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 September 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-12-october-2020,Prime Minister,2020-09-22,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus on 12 October 2020Good evening everyone.We are entering a new and crucial phase of our fight against Coronavirus.Because the number of cases has gone up four times in four weeksand it is once again spreading among the elderly and vulnerable.There are already more Covid patients in UK hospitals today than there were on 23 March when the whole country went into lockdownand deaths, alas, are also rising once again.These figures are flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet.And we must act now.So we are giving local authorities across England around a billion pounds so they can protect vital services as they fight the virus.Nightingale Hospitals across the North of England are being prepared for service.And so we can squash this virus wherever it appearswe are today simplifying, standardising and in some places toughening local rules in England by introducing three levels of Covid Alert.Medium, with existing national measures such as the Rule of Six and the closure of hospitality at 10pm.High, with extra measures including a ban on indoor social mixing between households or support bubbles.And Very High, for places where, without further action, the NHS will swiftly be under intolerable pressure.Areas within the Very High Alert category will be reviewed every four weeks and nowhere will be shut down indefinitely.And the exact restrictions at this level, Very High, will be worked out with local leaders, along with tailored packages of support.But at a minimum they will, sadly, include a ban on all social mixing between households in private places, including gardensand pubs and bars must close unless they can operate solely as a restaurant, serving alcohol only as part of a main meal.We will also ask people not to travel into and out of Very High alert level areas.Nobody affected by this will be left to fend for themselves.And we will expand our unprecedented economic support to assist those affected by these decisions,extending our Job Support Scheme to cover two-thirds of the wages of those in any business that is required to close,and providing those businesses with a cash grant of up to £3,000 a month, instead of £1500 every three weeks,and extra funding too for those in the Very High category for local test and trace and enforcement.You will shortly be able to type in your postcode into Gov.UK and see exactly what restrictions apply where you live.The majority of the country will, for now, be at medium.Most areas currently under local intervention will be at High,and Nottinghamshire, including Nottingham itself, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will also move to this level.Over the weekend we have been working with local leaders in areas where the data are most worrying.And from Wednesday, local authorities in the Liverpool City Region will move to the Very High alert level.In addition to pubs and bars we have agreed with Liverpool City mayor Steve Rotheram that gyms, leisure centres, betting shops, adult gaming centres and casinos will close.We are still working with other local leaders to determine how best to tackle the resurgence of the virus in their areas.But tackle it we will.No one, least of all me, wants to impose these kinds of erosions of our personal liberty,but I am as convinced as I have ever been that the British people have the resolve to beat this virusand that, together, we will do just that.With that I’ll hand over to the Chancellor, who has some more details on how we’ll be supporting these businesses, employees and areas affected by today’s changes."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 September 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-september-2020,Prime Minister,2020-09-09,"PM address the nation on coronavirus 22 SeptemberGood evening, the struggle against covid is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime.In less than a year this disease has killed almost a million people, and caused havoc to economies everywhere.Here in the UK we mourn every person we have lost, and we grieve with their families.And yet I am more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win – and to achieve what we must I want to talk to you directly tonight about the choices that we face – none of them easy – and why we must take action now.I know that we can succeed because we have succeeded before.When the sickness took hold in this country in March, we pulled together in a spirit of national sacrifice and community. We followed the guidance to the letter. We stayed at home, protected the NHS, and saved thousands of lives.And for months with those disciplines of social distancing we have kept that virus at bay.But we have to acknowledge this this is a great and freedom-loving country; and while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches – too many opportunities for our invisible enemy to slip through undetected.The virus has started to spread again in an exponential way. Infections are up, hospital admissions are climbing.We can see what is happening in France and Spain, and we know, alas, that this virus is no less fatal than it was in the spring, and that the vast majority of our people are no less susceptible, and the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families losing loved ones before their time;and I know that faced with that risk the British people will want their government to continue to fight to protect them, you, and that is what we are doing, night and day. And yet the single greatest weapon we bring to this fight is the common sense of the people themselves – the joint resolve of this country to work together to suppress covid now.So today I set out a package of tougher measures in England – early closing for pubs, bars; table service only; closing businesses that are not covid secure; expanding the use of face coverings, and new fines for those that fail to comply;and once again asking office workers to work from home if they can while enforcing the rule of six indoors and outdoors – a tougher package of national measures combined with the potential for tougher local restrictions for areas already in lockdown. I know that this approach – robust but proportionate – already carries the support of all the main parties in parliament.After discussion with colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, I believe this broad approach is shared across the whole UK. And to those who say we don’t need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own.The tragic reality of having covid is that your mild cough can be someone else’s death knell.And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable – with all the suffering that would entail – I must tell you that this is just not realistic, because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers.That’s why we need to suppress the virus now, and as for that minority who may continue to flout the rules, we will enforce those rules with tougher penalties and fines of up to £10,000. We will put more police out on the streets and use the army to backfill if necessary.And of course I am deeply, spiritually reluctant to make any of these impositions, or infringe anyone’s freedom, but unless we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later, when the deaths have already mounted and we have a huge caseload of infection such as we had in the spring.If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space – once again – to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-covid medical needs.And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend.It would mean renewed loneliness and confinement for the elderly and vulnerable, and ultimately it would threaten once again the education of our children. We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again.But if people don’t follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further. We must take action now because a stitch in time saves nine; and this way we can keep people in work, we can keep our shops and our schools open, and we can keep our country moving forward while we work together to suppress the virus.That is our strategy, and if we can follow this package together, then I know we can succeed because in so many ways we are better prepared than before.We have the PPE, we have the beds, we have the Nightingales, we have new medicines – pioneered in this country – that can help save lives.And though our doctors and our medical advisers are rightly worried about the data now, and the risks over winter, they are unanimous that things will be far better by the spring, when we have not only the hope of a vaccine, but one day soon – and I must stress that we are not there yet - of mass testing so efficient that people will be able to be tested in minutes so they can do more of the things they love. That’s the hope; that’s the dream. It’s hard, but it’s attainable, and we are working as hard as we can to get there.But until we do, we must rely on our willingness to look out for each other, to protect each other. Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour.If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together. There are unquestionably difficult months to come.And the fight against covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead.But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 31 July 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-9-september-2020,Prime Minister,2020-07-31,"PM press conference statement 9 September 2020Good afternoon,Welcome back to Downing Street for an update on coronavirus as we enter autumn and approach winter.I will first hand over to Chris to take us through the latest data before I set out how we are responding to it.Thank you Chris. It is clear from that very powerful graphic that we must act.The most important thing every one of us must do is remember the basics.First, wash your hands, regularly and for 20 seconds. Don’t get back into old habits, it is so vital.Second, wear a face covering over your mouth and nose if you are in an enclosed space and in close contact with people you don’t normally meet. I know wearing a face covering feels odd to some people and I understand that. But face coverings do make it harder for the virus to spread – so please, wear one to protect others.Third, make space. Always stay 2 metres away from people you don’t live with – or 1 metre with extra precautions, like extra ventilation, screens, or face coverings.Fourth, if you have COVID symptoms, get a test and self-isolate. We are now processing 1.2 million tests a week. To date we have carried out 15.4 million antigen tests – that’s more than any other country in Europe, and more per head than other European countries like Germany and Spain.We are increasing our testing capacity further to meet rising demand. You can help by only booking a test if you have a fever, a new continuous cough, or you’ve lost your sense of taste or smell – if you don’t have those symptoms and haven’t been asked to book a test, please don’t.So those are the basics – hands, face, space – and get a test if you have COVID symptoms.Since the pandemic began, we have asked you to reduce your social contact and limit your interactions with friends and family.I know that, over time, the rules have become quite complicated and confusing. We have spoken to police officers about what they need for an effective enforcement regime and of course, listened to the feedback from you, the public.In response, we are simplifying and strengthening the rules – making them easier for you to understand and for the police to enforce.I should stress that if we are to beat the virus then everyone, at all times, should limit social contact as much as possible and minimise interactions with other households. It is safer to meet outdoors and you should keep your distance from anyone you don’t live with, even if they are close friends or family.So in England, from Monday, we are introducing the rule of 6. You must not meet socially in groups of more than 6 – and if you do, you will be breaking the law.This will apply in any setting, indoors or outdoors, at home or in the pub.The ban will be set out in law and it will be enforced by the police – anyone breaking the rules risks being dispersed, fined and possibly arrested.This single measure replaces both the existing ban on gatherings of more than 30 and the current guidance on allowing 2 households to meet indoors. Now you only need to remember the rule of 6.There will be some limited exemptions. For example, if a single household or support bubble is larger than 6, they can still gather.COVID Secure venues like places of worship, gyms, restaurants and hospitality venues can still hold more than 6 people in total. Within those venues however, there must not be individual groups larger than 6, and groups must not mix socially or form larger groups.Education and work settings are unaffected, COVID Secure weddings and funerals can go ahead, up to a limit of 30 people, and organised sport will still be able to proceed.As we have found on previous occasions, this rule of 6 will of course throw up difficult cases. For example, two whole households will no longer be able to meet if they would together exceed the limit of 6 people.I am sorry about that and I wish that we did not have to take this step. But, as your Prime Minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to save lives.We will of course keep the rule of 6 under constant review and only keep it in place as long as it’s necessary.I also want to see – and the public wants to see – stronger enforcement of the rules which are already in place. So I’ve have tasked the Cabinet with increasing enforcement and I would like to thank the police, as always, and other authorities for the work they are doing to keep us all safe.In future:Premises and venues where people meet socially will be legally required to request the contact details of a member of every party, record and retain these details for 21 days, and provide them to NHS Test & Trace without delay when required.  We will support local authorities to make further and faster use of their powers to close venues that are breaking the rules and pose a risk to public health.  Fines will be levied against hospitality venues that fail to ensure their premises remain COVID Secure.  We will boost the enforcement capacity of local authorities by introducing COVID Secure Marshalls to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres, and by setting up a register of Environmental Health Officers that local authorities can draw upon for support.  We will simplify the Passenger Locator Form needed for travelling to the UK, and take measures to ensure these are completed and checked before departure.  Border Force will step up enforcement efforts at the border to ensure arrivals are complying with the quarantine rules.  We will also restrict the opening hours of premises, initially in some local areas.At the present time we must also, I’m afraid, revise plans to pilot larger audiences in venues later this month and review our intention to return audiences to stadiums and conference centres from 1 October. That doesn’t mean we’re going to scrap the programme entirely it just means we are going to review and abridge it, and the Culture Secretary will say more shortly.Let me be clear – these measures are not a second national lockdown – the whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown.By bearing down on social contact and improving enforcement, we can keep schools and businesses open, in the knowledge they are COVID Secure.I have always said schools and colleges should only ever be shut again as a very, very last resort. As the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser have said, the long term risks to children’s life chances of not going to school are significant and far greater than the health risks of going back to school.Indeed it’s been fantastic to see so many children back in school this term and I want, once again, to thank all our teachers, and to reassure parents and pupils that schools are safe.University terms will also begin soon. Opening universities is critical, again, for students’ life chances and, again, the health risks to individuals are low.Of course, many university students are in the age bracket where we have seen the infection rates rise recently as Chris was just explaining. My message to students is simple. Please, for the sake of your education and your parents’ and your grandparents’ health: wash your hands, cover your face, make space, and don’t socially gather in groups of more than 6, now and when term starts.Today the Department for Education is publishing updated guidance for universities on how they can operate in a COVID Secure way, including a clear request not to send students home in the event of an outbreak, so as to avoid spreading the virus across the country. I am very grateful to universities for their continued cooperation and planning for the return of students.The measures I have set out today will help us control the virus but won’t, on their own, be enough to allow a more significant return to normality.Patrick is going to set out in a moment where we are on vaccines and treatments in a moment, but we are not there yet and there are no guarantees.So over the summer, we have therefore been working up an alternative plan which could allow life to return closer to normality. And that plan is based on mass testing.Up to now, we have used testing primarily to identify people who are positive – so we can isolate them from the community and protect high risk groups. And that will continue to be our priority. We are working hard to increase our testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October.But in future, in the near future, we want to start using testing to identify people who are negative – who don’t have coronavirus and who are not infectious - so we can allow them to behave in a more normal way, in the knowledge they cannot infect anyone else with the virus.And we think, we hope, we believe that new types of test which are simple, quick and scalable will become available. They use swabs or saliva and can turn round results in 90 or even 20 minutes. Crucially, it should be possible to deploy these tests on a far bigger scale than any country has yet achieved – literally millions of tests processed every single day.That level of testing would allow people to lead more normal lives, without the need for social distancing:Theatres and sports venues could test all audience members on the day and let in those with a negative result, all those who are not infectious.Workplaces could be opened up to all those who test negative that morning and allow them to behave in a way that was normal before COVID.Those isolating because they are a contact, or quarantining after travelling abroad, could after a period be tested and released.Now that is an ambitious agenda, but we are going to pilot this approach in Salford from next month, with audiences in indoor and outdoor venues. And then we hope to go nationwide.There are a number of challenges. We need the technology to work. We need to source the necessary materials to manufacture so many tests. We need to put in place an efficient distribution network. And we need to work through the numerous logistical challenges.And as I say, we are not there yet, and I should repeat that, as we manage this period of high demand, it is especially important that if individuals don’t have symptoms, and have not been specifically advised to take a test, they should not be coming forward for a test - because they could be taking a test away from someone who really needs it.Our plan – this moonshot that I am describing – will require a giant, collaborative effort from government, business, public health professionals, scientists, logistics experts and many, many more.Work is underway – and we will get on at pace until we get there, round the clock.We are hopeful this approach will be widespread by the spring and, if everything comes together, it may be possible even for challenging sectors like theatres to have life much closer to normal before Christmas.But as I have said before, all this progress is contingent on continued scientific advances and though we’re hopeful, I cannot 100% guarantee that those advances will be made.That is why it is so important that we take these tough measures now.I believe we will continue to drive this virus down and that we will beat this virus before too long.So let’s work together and follow the rules: meet in groups of no more than six. Wash your hands, cover your face, and make space.I will now hand over to Patrick to set out the latest on vaccines and treatments, and then we’ll go to questions from the public and the media."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 17 July 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-31-july-2020,Prime Minister,2020-07-17,"PM statement on coronavirus 31 July 2020Good afternoon,Two weeks ago, I updated you from this podium on the progress we had made as a country against coronavirus.And in many ways that progress continues.The number of patients admitted to hospitals is still falling, and now stands at just over 100 each day.In April there were more than 3,000 coronavirus patients in mechanical ventilation beds, but now the latest figure is 87.The number of deaths continues to fall. That is obviously encouragingBut I have also consistently warned that this virus could come back and that we would not hesitate to take swift and decisive action as required.I am afraid that in parts of Asia and Latin America the virus is now gathering pace. And our European friends are also struggling to keep the virus under control.As we see these rises around the world, we cannot fool ourselves that we are exempt. We must be willing to react to the first signs of trouble.Today, the weekly survey by the Office for National Statistics reports that the prevalence of the virus in the community in England is likely to be rising for the first time since May.Around 1 in 1,500 now have the virus, compared to 1 in 1,800 on 15 July and 1 in 2,000 on 2 July. The ONS also estimate there are now 4,900 new infections every day, up from around 3,000 per day on 14 July and 2,000 per day at the end of JuneWe can’t afford to ignore this evidence.It’s vital to stress that we are in a far better position to keep the virus under control now than we were at the start of the pandemic – because we know so much more about the virus and have so many more tools at our disposal to deal with it.Our testing capacity has increased 100-fold.We have a contact tracing system up and running which has led to over 184,000 people isolating who may otherwise have spread the virus and is capable of tracing thousands of contacts every day.We have secured supplies of billions of items of PPE to withstand new demands on hospitals and care homes.And of course we have new treatments, like dexamethasone and remdesivir, to shorten recovery times and reduce mortality rates.But as I say, we cannot be complacent. I cannot – I won’t stand by and allow the virus to cause more pain and heartache in this country.Last night the Health Secretary announced new restrictions on household contact in the North West – specifically Greater Manchester, and parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire.These are targeted measures on social contact between households, which the data tells us is driving the current increase in cases. Businesses and workplaces should continue as before in those areas.I know how it is hard to have restrictions like this imposed on seeing your family and your friends. But we have to act rapidly in order to protect those we love.And we know this sort of intervention works – measures taken in Leicester and Luton have suppressed the virus, allowing us to relax measures.Even as we act locally, it is also my responsibility to look again at the measures we have in place nationally in light of the data we are seeing about incidence.At every point I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional – that it relies on continued progress against the virus, and that we would not hesitate to put on the brakes if required.With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control.On Saturday 1 August, you’ll remember, we had hoped to reopen in England a number of higher risk settings that had remained closed. Today, I am afraid we are postponing these changes for at least a fortnight.That means that, until 15 August at the earliest:Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services must remain closed.Indoor performances will not resume.Pilots of larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will not take place.Wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted, but ceremonies can continue to take place, in line with COVID-Secure guidelines.I know that the steps we are taking will be a heavy blow to many people – to everyone whose wedding plans have been disrupted, or who now cannot celebrate Eid in the way they would wish, I am really, really sorry about that. But we simply cannot take the risk.We will of course study the data carefully and move forward with our intention to open up as soon as we possibly can.Two weeks ago, I also said that from tomorrow the government would give employers more discretion over how employees can work safely – whether by continuing to work from home or attending a Covid Secure workplace. We know that employers have gone to huge lengths to make workplaces safe, so that guidance remains unchanged.We also said we would pause shielding nationally from 1 August – based on clinical advice, that national pause will proceed as planned, and our medical experts will be explaining more about that decision later and about shielding later today.Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their bit to control the virus. But we must keep our discipline, we must be focused and we cannot be complacent.I have asked the Home Secretary to work with the police and others to ensure the rules which are already in place are properly enforced.That means local authorities acting to close down premises and cancel events which are not following Covid Secure guidance.And it means a greater police presence to ensure face coverings are being worn where this is required by law.We will also extend the requirement to wear a face covering to other indoor settings where you are likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet, such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship.We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings, and this will become enforceable in law from 8 August.At this stage, we are not changing the rules on social contact nationally. I don’t want to tell people to spend less time with their friends. But unless people follow the rules and behave safely, we may need to go further.Two weeks ago, I said we would hope for the best but plan for the worst.And of course we continue to hope for the best. The way to get there and to achieve that optimum outcome is if we all follow the rules, wash our hands, cover our faces, keep our distance – and get a test if we have symptoms, so that NHS Test and Trace can keep the virus under control.This is how we will avoid a return to full national lockdown.We’ve made huge progress together.I know we are going succeed and I know we are going to beat this – if each and every one of us plays our part."
"Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 July 2020",https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-17-july-2020,"Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary",2020-07-09,"PM statement on coronavirus 17 JulyGood morning,In the two weeks since I last addressed you from this podium, I am pleased to report that we have continued to make steady progress in our collective effort to beat the coronavirus.For 3 weeks now, the number of new cases identified through testing each day has been below 1,000.The latest SAGE advice is that, across the UK, the R rate remains between 0.7 and 0.9.SAGE also assess that the number of infections is shrinking by between 5 and 1 per cent every day.The latest ONS data shows prevalence and new infections to be stable and low.The number of patients newly admitted to hospital with coronavirus each day, and the number of coronavirus patients in mechanical ventilation beds, have both fallen by more than 90% from their peak in early April.And while we mourn every death, the average daily death rate continues, steadily, to fall.This progress is testament to the phenomenal efforts of our NHS and social care staff working tirelessly on the frontline.And it has only been possible thanks to the character and fortitude with which you, the British people, have made fundamental changes to the way you all live and work.When we set out our plan to rebuild on 11 May, we said our goal was to return life to as close to normal as possible, for as many people as possible, as fast and as fairly as possible, in a way that is safe and continues to protect our NHS.That goal remains the same – but the tools we use to achieve it are changing.At the start of the pandemic, when we knew far less about the nature and spread of the virus, we had to take blanket, national measures.National lockdown was undoubtedly the right thing to do and has saved many thousands of lives.Now however, we know more about the virus – we understand the epidemiology better and our intelligence on where it is spreading is vastly improved.That means we can control it through targeted, local action instead.In England, this work is led by NHS Test and Trace and within it the Joint Biosecurity Centre. My sincere thanks go to Dido Harding who oversees this work and who joins me today.This approach is already working.In Weston-super-Mare and Kirklees, we took swift and successful action to contain outbreaks at specific premises.In Bradford and Blackburn with Darwen, we identified troubling trends in the data and worked closely with the respective local authorities to increase testing and take targeted action. That work continues.And in Leicester, we instituted a local lockdown in order to bear down on stubborn rates of infection. As the Health Secretary announced last night, we will begin to relax the restrictions there next week. We can do so because the data is improving – with the percentage of people testing positive falling from a weekly rate of 12.2% on 29 June to 4.8% yesterday.The approach varies in different parts of the UK, but all parts of the UK benefit from the support of our armed forces, additional testing facilities, and billions of pounds of support provided by this Government.Today we are publishing our framework for containing and controlling future outbreaks in England, which will enable national and local government to work closely together.From tomorrow, local authorities will have new powers in their areas. They will be able to close specific premises, shut public outdoor spaces, and cancel events. These powers will enable local authorities to act more quickly in response to outbreaks, where speed is paramount.Action by local councils will not always be sufficient. So next week we will publish draft regulations which clearly set out how central government can intervene more effectively at a local level.Where justified by the evidence, ministers will be able to close whole sectors or types of premises in an area, introduce local “stay at home” orders, prevent people entering or leaving defined areas, reduce the maximum size of gatherings beyond national rules, or restrict transport systems serving local areas.I know that it will be hard going for people affected by these local measures. It isn’t easy, and for some it may seem unjust that people just a short distance away can live their lives closer to normal.But it has to be right that we take local action in response to local outbreaks – there is no point shutting down a city in one part of the country to contain an outbreak in another part of the country.Now of course, this local approach relies on having an effective testing regime in place.And here we have made substantial progress.Antigen test capacity – that’s the test which tells you if you currently have the virus – has increased 100-fold since the start of March, from fewer than 2,000 tests a day to more than 200,000 tests a day now.Publicly available data suggests we are now carrying out our tests more than anywhere else in Europe in total, and more tests than Germany, France, Italy and Spain per capita.We have set up testing sites around the UK and now have 200 mobile units which can be rapidly deployed wherever they are needed.It is now the case, and has been for some time, that anyone, anywhere in the UK with symptoms can get a test without delay. We are also testing increasing numbers of people who don’t have symptoms but who are at higher risk.As we approach winter, we will need to go further – not least as many more people will show Covid-like symptoms as a result of seasonal illnesses, and therefore require a test.So we will further increase testing capacity to at least half a million antigen tests a day – 3.5 million antigen tests a week – by the end of October.Demand for testing is not the only challenge that winter will bring.It is possible that the virus will be more virulent in the winter months – and it is certain that the NHS will face the usual, annual winter pressures.We have taken a number of steps therefore to get the NHS ready for winter.We have massively increased the number of ventilators available to patients across the UK – up from 9,000 before the pandemic to nearly 30,000 now.We have substantially increased the pipeline of personal protective equipment for the NHS and social care -constituting over 30 billion items of PPE over the course of the pandemic.We will be rolling out the biggest ever flu vaccination programme in the history of the U.K.And we will also of course give the NHS the resources it needs.And today, I can confirm that we are providing an additional £3 billion of funding to the NHS in England to get ready for winter. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive additional funds.This will allow the NHS to continue to use the extra hospital capacity acquired from the independent sector and also to maintain the Nightingale hospitals until the end of March.This new funding comes on top of the additional £30 billion of funding for health and social care that we have already announced this year.So we are making sure we are ready for winter, and planning for the worst.But even as we plan for the worst, I strongly believe we should also hope for the best.That means looking ahead with optimism – now extending our plan to lift the remaining national measures which have restricted our lives since March so we can get back to something closer to normal life.Now I must stress, the timetable I am about to set out is conditional. It is contingent on every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly. It relies on our continued success in controlling the virus. And we will not proceed if doing so risks a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS.Nonetheless, it is important to give people hope and to give business confidence.So in England, from today we are making clear that anybody may use public transport, while of course encouraging people to consider alternative means of transport where they are available.From 25 July, we have already committed to reopening the indoor gyms, pools and other sports facilities.From 1 August, we will update our advice on going to work.Instead of government telling people to work from home, we are going to give employers more discretion, and ask them to make decisions about how their staff can work safely.That could mean of course continuing to work from home, which is one way of working safely and which has worked for many employers and employees.Or it could mean making workplaces safe by following Covid Secure guidelines. Whatever employers decide, they should consult closely with their employees, and only ask people to return to their place of work if it is safe.As we reopen our society and economy, it’s right that we give employers more discretion while continuing to ensure employees are kept safe.Also from 1 August, we will reopen most remaining leisure settings, namely bowling, skating rinks and casinos, and we will enable all close contact services such as beauticians to resume.Nightclubs and soft play areas will sadly need to remain closed for now – although this will be kept under review.We will restart indoor performances to a live audience, subject to the success of pilots, and we will also pilot larger gatherings in venues like sports stadia, with a view to wider reopening in the Autumn.We will also allow wedding receptions for up to 30 people.All of these measures for 1 August should be done in a Covid Secure way.In September, schools, nurseries and colleges will be open for all children and young people on a full-time basis, as planned.And universities are also working to reopen as fully as possible.From October, we intend to bring back audiences in stadia and to allow conferences and other business events to recommence – again, these changes must be done in a Covid Secure way, subject to the successful outcome of pilots.Throughout this period, we will look to allow more close contact between friends and family when we can.It is my strong and sincere hope that we will be able to review the outstanding restrictions and allow a more significant return to normality from November at the earliest – possibly in time for Christmas.At all times, we will continue to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to support and care for those at risk, wherever they live in the UK.We have said that the shielding programme for those most at risk in England, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be paused at the end of this month. We will stay constantly vigilant and be sure to restart shielding at any point if required.Now I know some will say this plan is too optimistic, that the risks are too great and that we won’t overcome the virus in time.And of course, if they are right in saying that, and we cannot exclude that they are, let me reassure them, and reassure you: that we will not hesitate at any stage to put on the brakes.From May 11 onwards, this plan has been conditional, and it remains conditional.But if we continue to pull together as we have done so far, I know we can beat this virus.Hoping for the best, but planning for the worst – and it’s in that spirit that we must carry on waging this long, hard fight against Coronavirus.I’ll now hand over to Dido."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 July 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/digital-culture-media-and-sport-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-9-july-2020,Prime Minister,2020-07-03,"Coronavirus press conference (9 July 2020)For months now, our lives have been on hold.When the call came in March, we pressed pause on many of the things that brighten our lives.Meals with friends.Trips to the cinema or theatre.We had to close our gyms and swimming pools.Cancel our holidays.And postpone some of our favourite events.But as we’ve made huge progress against this disease, we’ve gradually seen the things we love return.Today, I’m very pleased to announce we can go a little bit further. As of this weekend, our artists, musicians and dancers can start performing live outside to audiences. We’ll also have the resumption of recreational sport, followed later by the reopening of our gyms, swimming pools and leisure centres.Normal life is slowly returning.This is an important milestone for our performing artists, who have been waiting patiently in the wings since March. Of course we won’t see crowds flooding into their venues. But from 11 July, our theatres, operas, dance and music shows can start putting on outdoor performances to socially distanced audiences.That means theatregoers can experience a live play for the first time in months at places like the stunning Minack Theatre in Cornwall. And music lovers can attend Glyndebourne this summer.We are taking various measures to make these places safe as they reopen. Venue capacity will be reduced, and organisations encouraged to move to electronic ticketing, to help test and trace.But our performing artists deserve an audience. And now they will be getting one.And while those outdoor performances get underway, we will be working with the public health experts to carefully pilot a number of indoor performances - from the London Symphony Orchestra at St Luke’s, to Butlins - to work out how we can confidently usher socially-distanced audiences indoors as soon as possible.At the same time, we’re funding scientific studies to help us understand and mitigate some specific public health risks, like the impact of singing, wind and brass instruments on transmission.The more we know about coronavirus in every setting, the safer we will be.We’re also taking steps through the planning system to protect theatres and venues from demolition or change of use, and of course all of this comms on top of the unprecedented £1.57 billion package of emergency support to help arts, heritage and cultural institutions weather the COVID storm.But, of course, we want to see all of our venues open as soon as it’s safe to do so.Today’s announcement brings us a further step closer towards that reality.Having allowed hairdressers to reopen, beauticians, tattooists, spas, tanning salons and other close-contact services can now do the same I’m pleased to say from Monday. Of course that will be subject to some restrictions on particularly high risk services.As I’ve seen myself at the Royal Academy this morning, the National Gallery, and as we’ll see shortly from National Museums Liverpool, our cultural institutions are  beginning also to welcome back visitors.As these places begin to reopen their doors, I’m really urging people to get out there and to play their part. Buy the tickets for outdoor plays and music recitals, get to your local gallery and support your  local businesses.We have seen in recent weeks how our landlords, waiters and shop assistants have welcomed customers back with open arms, while doing so much to keep their communities safe. It’s time to give other businesses those same opportunities.The Chancellor this week set out a bumper package of tourism and hospitality tax breaks, to get these industries firing on all cylinders once more and protect the millions of people who work for them.That means a VAT cut on everything from tickets to shows, theatres, amusement parks, museums and zoos.Lower costs for hotels, inns, caravan and campsites.Vouchers for food and non-alcoholic drinks.I’m urging the British people to make the most of this summer safely. We need them to support the places that we all love.And today there is good news for our nation’s fitness.As we all know, exercise is incredibly important for both physical and mental health. Even at the height of lockdown it was considered an essential activity - with countless people hitting their parks for their daily run or transforming their living rooms into temporary gyms.From this weekend onwards, millions of people will be able to rejoin their local sports teams as soon as their organisations publish approved guidance. Recreational cricket is back on this weekend. Five-a-side football, basketball, hockey and countless other sports will follow shortly after.From this Saturday, they’ll also be able to enjoy outdoor pools and waterparks.And from Saturday 25th, people will no longer have to work out in the park or on their living room floor. They’ll be able to get back into their gyms, their indoor swimming pools, their leisure centres, and jump on the spin bike or treadmill for the first time in months.Now we’ve made a number of positive visits to gyms in recent weeks, and of course had hoped to do this sooner. But we really do have to phase this properly. We will be giving gyms the certainty, clarity and time they need to reopen safely, so that the maximum number can open their doors in just two weeks’ time.Again, we’ve worked intensively with both professional bodies and the experts to get us to this point, and facilities will have to take a number of measures to protect their communities. That includes for example using timed booking systems to limit the number of people using the facility at any one time, and reduced class sizes. Equipment will be spaced out, and there will be enhanced cleaning throughout.As always, the public will need to do their bit and follow the guidance sensibly and safely. All of the measures we are taking are conditional and reversible. And we will not hesitate to impose lockdowns where there are local spikes - as we saw in Leicester, where things remain closed and of course in any other place when that is necessary.But the return of gyms and recreational sport is a vital part of our battle against coronavirus.We need to get the nation to get match-fit to defeat this disease.And our fight began with a collective effort, and I really hope it will end with one. At the beginning, we all stayed home to protect the NHS and save lives.Now the British public has a new part to play.It’s time to eat out to help out.To enjoy the arts to help out.And to work out to help out.It’s over to all of you to help the country recover safely.Thank you."
Education Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 02 July 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-3-july-2020,Education Secretary,2020-07-02,"Good evening,Since I last spoke to you from this podium, we have continued to make progress nationally against the virus.We are now reporting regularly fewer than 1,000 new cases each day.The Office for National Statistics estimates that between 14 June and 27 June, the most recent period they have analysed, 25,000 people in the community in England had the virus – 1 person in every 2,200.SAGE assess that the R rate – the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto – remains between 0.7 and 0.9 across the UK.SAGE also assess that, in England, the number of new infections is shrinking by between 2 and 5% every day.And while the number of people dying with coronavirus remains too high, the numbers do continue to fall.Now of course this picture is not universal. There are areas – such as Leicester – where the virus is still more prevalent than we would like.We always said there would be local outbreaks requiring local action. This is to be expected and will, I’m afraid, be a feature of our lives for some time to come.But that should not take away from the great progress we have made, together, as a country against this vicious disease.This progress is the reason why we have been able – slowly, carefully, cautiously – to ease the national lockdown.Without doubt, lockdown has saved many hundreds of thousands of lives – but it has also had a devastating impact on our way of life and our economy.And of course, lockdown has not yet been lifted entirely.Indoor gyms, nail bars and swimming pools are still closed, mass gatherings are still prohibited, social distancing is still essential.I want these restrictions to be lifted as soon as possible – of course I do.We have established taskforces to work rapidly and closely with the sectors that remain closed to explore how they can be Covid Secure. I am pleased to report good progress is being made.Next week we will set out a timetable for their re-opening – though of course I can only lift those remaining, national restrictions as and when it is safe to do so.Our goal remains to enable as many people as possible to live their lives as close to normally as possible – in a way which is as fair and as safe as possible.To achieve this we need to move away from blanket, national measures, to targeted, local measures.So instead of locking down the whole country, we will lock down specific premises or local areas where the virus is spreading.Instead of closing down non-essential retail and hospitality nationwide, we will only shut establishments locally as required.Instead of shutting all schools for most pupils, from September we will only shut those schools where it is absolutely necessary to control an outbreak.And instead of quarantining arrivals from the whole world, we will only quarantine arrivals from those countries where the virus is, sadly, not yet under control.We are already implementing this targeted approach in England.In Weston-Super-Mare, we identified an outbreak in a hospital, closed it to visitors and new admissions, tested all staff and patients and gave the hospital a deep clean. The outbreak was contained and the hospital is open again.In Kirklees, we identified an outbreak at a meat packing plant, shut down the plant, moved in a mobile testing unit, tested all employees and traced the contacts of those who were positive. The outbreak was contained and the plant has reopened with additional safety measures in place.And of course more recently in Leicester, we identified a community-wide outbreak which was not restricted to a single location, unlike Weston-Super-Mare and Kirklees. Public Health England engaged with the local authority, mobile testing units were deployed, full data was shared – council-wide data was shared on 11 June, and postcode-level data was shared last week.This enhanced monitoring through additional testing showed that the infection rate in Leicester was three times the next highest infection rate in any other city in the country. So on Monday, the Health Secretary announced local lockdown measures in Leicester for an initial period of 2 weeks.In each of these cases, the problems identified were specific to Weston-Super-Mare, Kirklees and Leicester. So of course it made sense to take action locally, rather than re-impose restrictions on the whole country.And we are learning the whole time. With each local outbreak, we see what works well and what not so well, so that we do better next time.Informed by our experience of these cases, we have developed an approach for controlling future local outbreaks which has five principle components: monitoring, engagement, testing, targeted restrictions and finally, as a last resort, lockdown.First, monitoring. Public Health England, working with the Joint Biosecurity Centre, will examine carefully data on the spread of the disease and people’s behaviour across the country. They will look out for emerging trends, rising case numbers and other indicators, while taking into account local factors. Critically, we have made local data available to all Directors of Public Health in local authorities, so they too can monitor what is happening in their area. And local data will also be available to the public on the gov.uk dashboard.Second, engagement. If monitoring identifies local problems, NHS Test and Trace and PHE will work with the relevant local authority to develop a deeper understanding of the problem and identify solutions. Working with local agencies, we will seek to keep the local community informed at every stage, so they know what is happening and what actions, if any, they need to take.Third, testing. We now have substantial testing capacity nationwide and we have the ability to target that capacity at local areas in order to get a grip on emerging outbreaks. Scaled-up testing at a local level, combined with contract tracing through NHS Test and Trace, can control the virus and thus avoid more stringent measures.Fourth, targeted restrictions. If the virus continues to spread, we will restrict activities at particular locations and close individual premises. As in Weston-Super-Mare and Kirklees, we will restrict access to places which become hotspots for the virus, while testing people who have spent time in those places, and tracing the contacts of anyone who tests positive.Fifth, local lockdown. If the previous measures have not proven to be enough, we will introduce local lockdowns extending across whole communities. As in Leicester, that could mean shutting businesses venues that would otherwise be open, closing schools or urging people once more to stay at home. Local lockdowns will be carefully calibrated depending on the scientific and specific circumstances of each outbreak and we are continually exploring smarter means of containing the virus.So that is the approach we will take as local outbreaks occur and we will set out more detail soon.Let me end by looking forward to this weekend.Tomorrow, there will be a moment of remembrance for those whose lives have tragically been lost before their time.And at 5pm on Sunday, the NHS’s 72nd birthday, we can all come together to clap those who have worked tirelessly and selflessly to help the nation get through this pandemic.I know everyone will be looking forward to the relaxation of national restrictions. As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, B&Bs, indeed much of our tourism industry.All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.Lockdown only succeeded in controlling the virus because everyone worked together, and we will only succeed in reopening if everyone works together again. Because we are not out of the woods yet. The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that. If it starts running out of control again this Government will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re-imposing restrictions.Anyone who flouts social distancing and COVID-Secure rules is not only putting us all at risk but letting down those businesses and workers who have done so much to prepare for this new normal.So as we take this next step, our biggest step yet, on the road to recovery, I urge the British people to do so safely.Remember – don’t gather in groups of more than 6 outside or 2 households in any setting.Keep your distance from those outside your household – 2 metres if you can, 1 metre with precautions if you can’t.Wash your hands.Let’s all stay alert, control the virus, save lives – and enjoy summer safely."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/education-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-02-july-2020,Prime Minister,2020-06-23,"Today, I am going to concentrate on our plans for the autumn for schools, early years and further education. Getting our children back to school is a vital part of our national recovery from the Covid-19 outbreak. Our children’s futures depend on it. They will be the doctors, the teachers, the engineers of tomorrow and we must make sure they are able to achieve their dreams.More and more parents are being reassured by the measures we are taking to keep their children safe and are letting them return to schools and nurseries if they are eligible to do so. As of this week there are more than 1.6 million children back in our schools.If you are one of those parents, I’d like to say thank you for putting your trust in us. I know many of you had doubts, and may still do. I want you to know that I treat my responsibility for your children with the utmost gravity. Their safety and wellbeing is my top priority. In welcoming more children back, we have followed not only the best scientific advice but also what other countries have been doing to manage a successful return for their children.At my last briefing, I told you how it was my intention for all children to be back in school in September. Today I want to give you more details about how we are going to make that happen.But before I do, I’d once more like to thank the fantastic school and college staff, childminders, nursery workers and carers who are all making this return possible.Schools, nurseries and early years settings have been welcoming more children back since the first of June. They have been keeping children in small consistent groups, with stringent infection control, hygiene and cleaning measures in place.Now that infection rates are falling, we can relax these bubbles and from 20 July we can lift the restrictions on early years settings, who will be able to return to their normal group sizes, although other safety measures must remain in place.We know that keeping contacts to a minimum is still one of the best ways to reduce the risk of infection and from this autumn, when the whole school population returns, we are asking schools to make sure that they continue to minimise contacts. This should be done by distancing where possible and by keeping classes or year groups separate from one another.We have suggested, for instance, that schools may stagger the start and end of a school day and that they keep their corridors as free from congestion as possible.We have issued full guidance on the approach schools and colleges should take and I expect them to apply this in a way that works most effectively for them, their students and their wider communities.We know that maintaining distance and bubbles may be more challenging in schools where children and young people have special educational needs and disabilities, so we have issued specific guidance for them.If anyone in a nursery, school or college develops Covid-19 symptoms they can already be tested. From September we are going to give all schools and colleges a limited number of home testing kits to give to any children and staff who are unable to get to a testing centre.Parents expect their children to be safe in school, but they also expect them to be getting a first-rate education. Which is why, from September, we will be asking schools to resume a broad and ambitious curriculum and we expect exams to go ahead as normal in the summer of 2021.We all know that the best place for children to learn is in school, which is why I have been so determined to get them back there as soon as we could. From September, attendance will once again be mandatory and no child should be out of school unless it has been agreed. This will be crucial if we are to minimise the effect of the pandemic on every child’s long-term educational development.I have already announced a £1 billion Covid catch up package to help children make up lost ground, including a £650 million catch up premium for state-funded primary, secondary and special schools and a £350 million National Tutoring Programme for the most disadvantaged pupils.I am confident that by adopting this carefully planned return in September, we will be in a good position to recover and rebuild our education system and ensure that none of our children lose out. By working together we will make sure that their hopes and dreams for the future are not going to be knocked off course."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-23-june-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-06-22,"The Prime Minister leading the coronavirus press conference on 23 June 2020Good evening,Could I have the first slide please?On 16 April, we set out our five tests for adjusting the lockdown, and since then they have guided our path out of lockdown.At every stage, we have diligently assessed our progress against these five tests before making changes.It has meant that we have, so far, avoided the catastrophe of a second peak of infection that could have overwhelmed the NHS and meant so many more lives lost.Next slide please.Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.Well, the NHS has coped fantastically under the extraordinary pressure of this extraordinary pandemic.On 20 June, 283 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - down from 438 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April.And on 22 June, 340 patients with coronavirus were in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 513 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.These numbers provide confidence that we are still meeting the first test.Next slide please.Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so that we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.Of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, it saddens me to report that 42,927 have now died. 171 fatalities were reported in the 24 hours to 5pm yesterday. A further 109 deaths which occurred in April, May and June have been identified and added to the total.As measured by a 7-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 121, down from 216 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.The second test is, therefore, still being met.Next slide please.Our third test is to receive reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.In total, 306,210 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, which is an increase of 874 cases since yesterday.The seven day rolling average of new positive cases is now 1,147, down from 1,543 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 5,195 on 14 April.Approximately one in 1,700 people in the community in England are now estimated to have the virus, down from 1 in 400 four weeks ago. SAGE believes infections across the UK are shrinking at a steady rate of between 4 and 2 per cent every day.Based on all the various data available, the government is confident the third test is being met.Next slide please.Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.Yesterday 237,142 tests were carried out or posted out across the UK, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April.The new NHS Test and Trace service has already advised over 87,000 people to self-isolate who might otherwise have unwittingly transmitted the virus.We have contracted with over 175 new suppliers able to deliver PPE at the scale and pace the UK requires.And this progress means we are satisfied that the fourth test is being met.Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS.I am once again grateful for the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their advice on the measures I am about to set out.I can confirm the government judges we have met the fifth test and we are therefore satisfied that all five tests are still being met.On 11 May, we set out our plan to recover.That plan as you may remember set out three steps for adjusting the lockdown.Step 1 was implemented, as planned, on 13 May, enabling people to spend more time outdoors.Step 2 was implemented, as planned, in phases on    1 and 15 June. Shops have opened, children have started to return to school and people have been able to see more of their loved ones.Now Step 3 can be implemented, as planned, on 4 July.All the measures I am about to set out apply to England - the devolved administrations are responsible for adjusting lockdown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, moving at the pace they believe is right for them.After a long period of asking you, the British public, to follow very strict and complex rules to bring coronavirus under control, we can now make life easier for people to see more of their friends and family, and to help businesses get back on their feet and people back into jobs.Critically, we can make a change to the guidance on two metres, which kept us safe while transmission of the virus was high but which can now be modified.Having considered all the evidence, while staying at two metres is preferable, we can now move to “1 metre plus” where it is not possible for us to stay two metres apart. This means staying one metre apart, plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission.These precautions could include installing screens, making sure people face away from each other, providing handwashing facilities, minimising the amount of time you spend with people outside your household, and of course being outdoors.On public transport, it means one metre plus wearing a face covering for mitigation, as everybody I think now understands.We are setting out COVID-Secure guidance to help businesses take the measures that are right for them.We can also allow more sectors to reopen on 4 July, as planned for Step 3.So, from 4 July, the following premises will be allowed to reopen provided they are COVID-Secure:hotels, bed and breakfasts and self-contained holiday accommodation  caravan parks and campsites  places of worship and libraries  restaurants and cafes  bars, pubs and social clubs  cinemas and bingo halls  museums and galleries  hair salons and barbers  outdoor playgrounds and outdoor gymsThis has been an incredibly tough time for these establishments. But I hope that everyone working in them can take confidence in knowing they will be able to open their doors once again in just a couple of weeks’ time.And of course they should do so in a way that is COVID-Secure, keeping customers and staff safe.But I am afraid to say that some premises, such as nightclubs, swimming pools and indoor gyms, must remain closed for now given the particular risks of transmission in those settings. However, we are establishing taskforces for those sectors to establish how they too can open, in a COVID-Secure way, as fast as possible.At the same time, we can give people more freedom to see their friends and family.From 4 July, your household will be able to meet with one other household at a time, including staying over.This can be indoors or outside, at your home, in a restaurant or pub, or in paid accommodation.I want to stress you should remain socially distant from anyone outside your household.For meeting outdoors, you can continue to meet in a park or a garden in a group of up to six people, drawn from six different households.Again, at all times you should maintain social distancing from anyone outside your household.As we give people back more control over their lives, we will be asking them to follow guidance on limiting their social contact, rather than forcing them to do so through legislation.And this obviously requires everyone to act responsibly, which I have no doubt they will do. It will still be possible for the police to break up large and irresponsible gatherings. But neither the police themselves, or the public that they serve, want virtually every aspect of our behaviour to be subject to the criminal law.Yesterday the Deputy Chief Medical Officer and the Health Secretary set out updated advice for those who are shielding in England, so that they can soon start to return to leading more normal lives.Opening up more of Britain in this COVID-Secure way is only possible if everyone continues to stay alert to the risks of coronavirus.That means you should:stay 2 metres apart and if you can’t do that then keep 1 metre apart with mitigations  wash your hands regularly  wear face coverings on public transport, or where you are indoors in a crowded environment where distancing is not possible  follow the rules when visiting businesses  crucially, get a test done immediately if you develop symptoms  and self-isolate if you are asked to by NHS Test and TraceWe are only able to make these changes because we have persevered together and stuck to our path.We had five tests - and we met them.We had a plan - and we stuck to it.The government has asked a huge amount of all of you, and the people of this country have met that challenge with good humour and common sense.Of course, the fight is far from over. This is a nasty virus still that wants to take advantage of our carelessness. I’m afraid there will be local outbreaks. And I must tell you that if the virus were to begin to run out of control, I will not hesitate to put on the handbrake on and reverse some of these changes, at a local or indeed national level as required.But we can avoid that if we all continue to stay alert and do our bit to control the virus. The British public have proved again and again, not that it was ever in doubt it, that they can be trusted to do the right thing and to do it with common sense.There is no doubt we are beating back this virus and, with your continued cooperation and good judgment we will beat it once and for all.I’ll now hand over to Patrick."
Education Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 19 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-june-2020,Education Secretary,2020-06-19,"Good afternoon, and welcome back to the coronavirus press conference.I’m joined by Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries.Dr Harries is going to set out our next steps for the 2.2 million people who have been shielding for the last 3 months. Just before we do, I’d like to take you through the latest data.This slide shows the number of tests that have been carried out, now over 8 million tests in total. And it also shows that for the first time since the peak, the number of positive cases confirmed is under a thousand, at 958. Next slide.The second slide shows the number of people in hospital, the top of the two shows the number of people admitted with COVID-19, which is 380. That’s down from 432 a week ago. The bottom chart shows the number of ventilated patients. That’s the number of patients on a mechanical ventilator, and that number is 330, down from 395 a week earlier. Clearly the number of people going into hospital and the number of people in the most serious condition in hospital in ventilated beds, both coming down. Next slide please.The regional picture is broadly the same across the country and for the first time since the peak there are fewer than 5,000 people in hospital with coronavirus. And if we go to the final slide, thank you.Thankfully the number of people who have died from coronavirus each day is also coming down. The latest data show that yesterday 15 more deaths were reported. This is the lowest figure since mid-March, the 15 March. Each of these deaths is someone who is loved and someone we mourn. And each death his one death too many. Nevertheless, the fact that we have a figure of reported deaths that is 15, much lower than any previous figure since the peak, is good news. However, it’s a weekend figure and we do see the number of deaths reported tend to rise after a weekend.Nevertheless having set out all those statistics, if you take into account the number of people in hospitals, the number of people going into hospital, the number of people testing positive and the number who sadly have died, all of those figures are coming down and are pointing in the right direction.It shows that, while there is still much to do, we are clearly making progress. We are working through our plan and our plan is working.We protected the NHS and thanks to the patience and sacrifice of everyone watching, infections are falling, the NHS is restoring and the virus is in retreat.A month ago, around 1 in 400 people had the virus. Now it’s around 1 in 1,700.This means that tomorrow the Prime Minister will be able to set out the next steps in our plan for more local action, and to ease the national lockdown.And there’s one group who have been more patient and given up more than almost any other, and that’s the 2.2 million people who have been shielding in England.Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own shielding programmes, so what we say today is about England only.Since the start, the clinical advice has been to protect those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to this disease.Our shielding programme – that has delivered medicine, support and more than a million food boxes – has been integral to that plan.I want to now speak directly to those of you who’ve been shielding.Like so many, I have friends and I have family who’ve been shielding. I know what a burden this has been.Shielding has involved not leaving your house for months, not seeing people you love, not being able to wander to the park for some fresh air, or even pop to the shops for something you need.This sacrifice has been for a purpose, and I want to thank every single one of you.We knew it was a difficult ask, but these measures have been vital in saving lives.Right from the start we’ve been clear that we didn’t want the shielding advice to be in place any longer than was clinically necessary.I’m very, very grateful to the clinicians who have led this work and kept the clinical advice under review.Dr Harries will now set out the next steps in that clinical advice and then I’ll set out the practical support that we’ll be maintaining.Dr HarriesI thought it might be helpful to say a few words on the clinical basis for the shielding programme: what we’re advising now and what we might see in the future. Particularly to the adults but also to the children who’ve been shielding.This is a new virus, we’re continuing to learn about its transmission and that knowledge will continue to grow over the coming years.At the start of the epidemic in the UK, using the information we had available, and our best understanding gained from other respiratory viruses, such as flu and SARS, we recognised that some people would likely be more vulnerable of severe outcomes from disease than others. This included older people and those with underlying medical conditions. Those are normally the people who would have a flu vaccination each year.This clinically vulnerable group we advised to be particularly stringent in following social distancing guidance. That recommendation continues.Senior clinicians recognise that for a small sub-set of the population there may be an even greater risk. So, for example, this would be those who may be on particularly high combinations of immunosuppressant treatments or where their disease was particularly poorly controlled.This group, the clinically extremely vulnerable, were those advised to shield.Shielding doesn’t alter the risk of illness if they become infected. It reduces the likelihood of meeting the virus in their daily lives. Now we’re out of the peak of the epidemic in the UK and estimated levels of community transmission and infection are back to those before shielding commenced, we are in a position to start relaxing the shielding advice over the next few weeks. We may well actually have some summer weather a little in our favour too.Therefore the advice to those shielding is to start taking steps now to start coming back to a more normal lifestyle.This has been a very difficult and sometimes frightening period for those shielding. To give people time to prepare we’re setting out the advice in a stepped approach. So first, from July 6, which is a time period when other measures have been eased to make sure we are monitoring the epidemiology continuously, we’re advising that people who are shielding may want to start meeting in groups of up to 6 outdoors, including those from outside their household.If you live alone or are a lone parent you can form a support bubble with another household. Those in that support bubble can then spend time in each others homes, including overnight.Secondly from August 1 we will pause shielding. We will still be advising people to stay at home as much as possible and to minimise contact with others outside their household. From August 1 our advice would be that people can go out to more places, see more people. This might include going to the shops, for example, or visiting a place of worship.If you do leave your home you should continue to keep a safe distance from people at all time, regularly washing your hands for 20 seconds is still one of the most effective ways that you can protect yourself. If you’re unable to work from home from August 1, you’re able to return to work, as long as the business is COVID-safe.When this programme started we used a precautionary principle. New evidence is telling us that the risks for individuals are often more clearly due to a combination of factors in that individual such as age, ethnicity, obesity levels for example, as well as the medical conditions that they have.The Chief Medical Officer has commissioned work to ensure that, should we need to step up the shielding programme again, we would have available a much more individualised way for you and your doctor to understand your risk and receive more tailored advice.The new risk assessment research methodology is being published today by academic colleagues led by Oxford University. In the future, therefore, those who we advise to take action may be slightly different group to those who shielded through this new disease peak.Where this is particularly relevant is for children. As evidence has evolved, we’ve seen that admission to hospital for all children under 18 for COVID-19 is very low indeed. Only 36 children in the UK have been admitted to intensive care. Shielding guidance to date has covered a broad range of conditions and clinical vulnerabilities. We know that many parents have been worried about how they can protect their children, and they often carry the burden themselves.Now we have new guidance developed by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and this will help families understand who does and does not need to shield. Now we have more evidence we can be much more specific about risk and it’s very likely in the future very few children will need to shield.The evidence the clinical experts have brought together strongly recommends children and young people who are cared for just in primary care are very unlikely to need to continue to shield in the future. There is a group of children who exist that, due to their underlying condition, may need to continue to shield. Over the summer parents can look forward to discussions through routine paediatric appointments. In the interim we will be talking with your doctors and the royal colleges to ensure everyone has the right information. For now there is no need for parents to speak to their doctor immediately. We will sort that information out in due course.For anybody with underlying clinical conditions, whether adult or child, looking forward and after shielding advice has paused we will still advise you to be careful. Keep your overall social interactions down, as low as feels comfortable initially, whether at home or in work, keep practising good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.Finally I would like to say special thank you to clinical colleagues, particularly in primary care, and specialists in hospitals and all of their staff who have been working hard to support those shielding over the last 3 monthsSecretary of State for Health and Social CareI’ll just set out the practical consequences of all this. I’m sure the whole nation is grateful, Jenny, that your wisdom is guiding this work and grateful for setting out the clinical advice so clearly.Over the next few weeks we’ll all have time for these changes.First, In the coming days, as I promised I will write to everyone on the shielded patient list with further details about what this means for you and what to expect, and we will update our online guidance in line with these changes.I know that after 3 months of shielding it might take time to adjust to the new guidelines.We are working closely with the NHS, councils and charities to make sure this updated advice is as clear as possible.If you are receiving centrally provided food boxes or medicine deliveries, this will continue until the end of July.And I can announce that 7 supermarkets have confirmed ongoing access to priority supermarket delivery slots, for as long as they are needed.Support from NHS Volunteer Responders will continue, and so too will the support from NHS mental health services for those struggling with their mental health.And for anyone facing financial hardship, we’ve made money available to councils to help those struggling to buy food and other essentials.And my message to employers is crystal clear. Please work with us to ease the transition back to a more normal way of life for shielding employees. We expect you to do the right thing.Nothing matters more than keeping people safe, and we will keep the evidence about the risks to people under constant review.The NHS will maintain the shielded patient list and we stand ready to support people to shield again if that’s what’s clinically required, including through an enhanced digital platform.The support for the shielded has been a huge effort of community spirit, with practical and emotional support alongside the brilliant work of Public Health England and the NHS, supported by my department, the communities department and under the leadership of Chris Townsend in government.So I want to say a huge thank you to those who shielded, to all those who looked after them, and to each and every one of you who’ve played your part in the national effort to bring this virus under control.Together, let’s keep going.Stay alert, control the virus, and save lives."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 18 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/education-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-19-june-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-06-18,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 19 June2020: Coronavirus press conference 19 June 2020.Welcome to today’s briefing from Downing Street. I’ll start with an update on the progress we’re making to beat the virus, before moving on to an update on schools.The first slide shows the latest COVID alert level:The COVID-19 alert level across the UK has moved down from level 4 to level 3, as recommended by the Joint Biosecurity Centre.  The Chief Medical Officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have reviewed the evidence and agree with this recommendation.  In all four nations, there has been a continuing steady decrease in cases but this does not mean that the pandemic is over. The virus is still in general circulation, and localised outbreaks are likely to occur.The second slide shows cases confirmed with a test:7,433,114 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 169,600 tests carried out or posted out yesterday.  301,815 people have tested positive, an increase of 1,346 cases since yesterday.  SAGE has confirmed today that their estimate of the R rate for the UK is unchanged on last week, at 0.7-0.9. We want to keep the R number below 1.0. R is the average number of additional people infected by each infected person.The third slide shows the latest data from hospitals:494 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 16 June, down from 534 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April.  354 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 392 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.The fourth slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country:There are now 5,030 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 10% from 5,608 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,699 on 12 April.  As the graphs show, while there is some variation, most nations and regions of the UK are broadly following a similar pattern.The fifth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus:Across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 42,461. That’s an increase of 173 fatalities since yesterday.  When measured by a 7-day rolling average, the daily number of deaths currently stands at 140, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.Turning to schools.In March when we asked schools to close we did something different from virtually every other nation, we made the decision to keep schools and nurseries open not just for the children of critical workers but also to those children who are the most vulnerable in society. This was because we recognised the important role that they play in keeping those children safe.From the start of this month, schools began to welcome back children from nursery, reception, Year 1 and Year 6 as part of a phased and cautious return. And from this week, we started to see the return of years 10 and 12.We want as many children back in school as possible which is why, this week, we announced more flexibility for primary schools so that they have the opportunity to bring back more of their pupils if they are able to do so, in line with the protective measures that we have set out.Today, with the overwhelming majority of primary and secondary schools, as well as colleges and nurseries, opening to more children and young people, I wanted to take the opportunity, again, to say thank you. Thank you to all of the teachers, childcare and support staff who have done and continue to do so much to welcome children back in to such a positive, supportive environment.I think all of us who have seen our children return to school, know they are enjoying being back in the classroom and being with their friends and other children.School is vital for every one of our children. That is why we will bring all children, in all year groups, back to school in September.While many children have already returned to school, I do understand the anxiety that some parents continue to feel. I want to assure you the wellbeing of your child is absolute top priority of us all.We have put robust protective measures in place, including a hierarchy of controls and protective bubbles - I must stress that it is in every child’s best interest to return to school if they are eligible and able.This measured return is part of our roadmap, it’s part of how we will recover and rebuild.But I think all of us recognise how much children have missed out, and why it is so important we support them to catch up on lost ground.Having opened schools to more pupils and set out our intention for a full return in September, the next part of our recovery will be to roll out our hugely ambitious catch-up plan for all our children. We must get them back to where they should be and put in place a secure foundation for longer term reform. We will not allow an entire generation to lose out on their education or accept lower expectations for them.That’s why we are launching the £1 billion Covid catch-up plan that will lift outcomes for all pupils, with targeted support for those from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of falling behind because of this disruption.As part of this package, we’ll provide a universal ‘catch up premium’ worth £650 million for all state school children in England to help them to make up for the lost teaching time in the next academic year.The Education Endowment Foundation has published a guide for schools on how the money could be best spent, which will include intervention programmes, access to technology or summer schools.This crisis will have affected children in many different ways – and for this reason I am giving schools the discretion to tailor this funding towards their particular needs and the needs of the children they teach.The plan also includes a new £350 million National Tutoring Programme to increase access to high-quality tuition for disadvantaged children and young people. This will not only help children in the short term but will create a positive, long-lasting legacy to drive up standards - expanding the number of high-quality tutoring providers for all schools to use.This £1 billion package is on top of the £14.4 billion three-year funding settlement announced last year - recognising the additional work schools will need to do to help students to catch up.Over the coming weeks we will publish further information and guidance to help schools prepare for a full return in September. We are working across Government and with the sector to ensure these plans are fully in place so that this can happen.The pandemic has dealt an unprecedented shock to our education system, as it has to many other parts of our national life. Although we have a clear plan, there will of course be times when we have to respond quickly to changing circumstances. If this virus has taught us one thing, it is the absolute importance of being flexible and adaptable when we have to be.The education system has shown it can do this and more.We all want to see every child back in school and we will work together to achieve this."
"Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 17 June 2020",https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-18-june-2020,"Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary",2020-06-17,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Downing Street daily coronavirus briefing.I’m joined today by Baroness Dido Harding, the Executive Chair of NHS Test and Trace.Before we start, I want to recognise the sad loss of Dame Vera Lynn. She united us in the worst crisis that this country faced. Ever since, she’s inspired us all with the words she will always be associated with: ‘we will meet again’.We send our condolences to her family and we will all remember her warmly.First things first, I’d like to take you through the latest data, then talk about NHS Test and Trace and vaccines.First slide please.The first slide shows that yesterday there were 136,516 tests, taking the total to 7-and-a-quarter million tests in total. There were 1,218 positive test results.If we go to the next slide, this slide shows the estimated number of people who had COVID-19 in England according to ONS’s (Office for National Statistics) survey. As you can see, the number has been coming down over time. And this same survey implies around 4.5 thousand new cases per day.Data from hospitals also shows that broad downward direction. There 490 admissions with COVID-19 on 15 June and, as we can see, the number of people on mechanical ventilator beds is 360.The number of people in hospital continues to come down in almost every region. You can see a very small up-tick in the east of England. But, as you can see from the charts, there is some movement in the variation in each of the lines.Overall movement continues to be down. Overall, 5,193 down from 5,863 this time last week.Final slide of this group. When it comes to the number of people who have sadly died from coronavirus, yesterday the number of deaths reported was 135, bringing the total to 42,288. Again, we can see the downward trajectory, thankfully, of that number.The number of 135 is lower than this time last week, but there’s still some way to go.There’s one additional report that’s worth looking at.Today’s weekly surveillance report from Public Health England shows that last week, for the first week since mid-March, the number of people who died in this country, in total, from coronavirus or anything else, was no higher than is normal at this time of year. So that demonstrates that the number of deaths is coming right downBut the battle against this virus is not over.And it’s a battle with many fronts. And there are 2 areas that I want to update you about today.VaccinesThe first is vaccines.Before I talk about coronavirus vaccines, I just want to mention a very important reminder about other routine vaccines that are there to protect you.Throughout the crisis we’ve tried to keep the vaccination programme for children going. That has been largely successful.But if you, or your child, is invited for a vaccination, like MMR, please make sure you attend. It’s very important we don’t fall behind on vaccinations for other diseases because of this crisis.During this pandemic, we have put stringent measures in place to protect people who are getting vaccinations.And, in the long run, the best way to defeat this virus is, of course, the discovery of a vaccine. And, since the start, we have been supporting the most promising projects.As of this week, the Imperial vaccine is now in the first phase of human clinical trials and AstraZeneca has struck a deal for the manufacture of the Oxford vaccine.They’re starting manufacturing now, even ahead of approval, so we can build up a stockpile and be ready, should it be clinically approved. Just like with dexamethasone, the treatment which we stockpiled before we had the proof it was clinically effective. So we are starting the manufacture of the Oxford vaccine now so that it will be ready should the science come off.Today, we have published the way in which we propose to prioritise people for access to a vaccine, as soon as one comes available.Just as we did for testing, we will be guided by the clinical science, prioritising those in most need.I am very grateful to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which has published its interim advice today.They recommend priority vaccination for 2 groups: frontline health and social care workers, and those at increased risk of serious disease and death from coronavirus, including, for example, adults over the age of 50 and those with heart and kidney disease.As we learn more about the virus, we will continue to take into account which groups may be particularly vulnerable, including for example those from ethnic minority backgrounds.So we can protect the most at risk first should a vaccine become available and get this country back on her feet as soon as we possibly can.Test and TraceOur approach on vaccines is to throw everything at it, as fast as we can, and rigorously to test and make sure they are safe before deployment.This is our approach across the board, including for Test and Trace too. That’s the second area I want to focus on today.Baroness Harding will talk through the latest figures from our NHS Test and Trace programme shortly.Today’s data shows a system that is working well and constantly improving. And, remember, each one of the thousands of people who are now isolating because of the NHS Test and Trace programme and all the work of those involved is someone who would have been innocently going about their daily lives not knowing that they were a risk to their community.And, as you may remember, our plan is to complement this human contact tracing with a contact tracing app. Like other governments around the world, we have been working hard on this, and I want to be up-front and open about the challenges that we, and other countries, are facing.Over the past few weeks, we have rigorously tested our prototype app in the Isle of Wight, and in field trials ‒ and I want to thank everyone who has been involved and all the islanders of the Isle of Wight: the council, who have been brilliant, the local NHS, and Bob Seely, the local MP, who has played a real leadership role.Because of this testing, we discovered a technical barrier, that every other country building their own app is also now hitting. We have found that our app works well on Android devices, but Apple’s software prevents iPhones being used effectively for contact tracing, unless you use Apple’s own technology.After we started work on our app, Google and Apple then started work on their own product, and as soon as they did this, we began working on both. We kept our options open, in the same way as we do with other areasAnd I feel, personally, in this fight, more than any other, we must leave no stone unturned. So I asked Dido and the NHS expert Test and Trace team to make sure they worked on both products.Oof course, we have been testing Google and Apple’s product too. And as we did this, we have found that it does not estimate distance well enough. Measuring distance is mission critical to any contact tracing app.So, as it stands, our app won’t work, because Apple won’t change their system. But it can measure distance.And their app can’t measure distance well enough to a standard we are satisfied with. Throughout this, for me, what matters is what works. Because what works will save lives.And I will work with anyone, public or private sector, here or overseas, to gain any inch of ground against this disease. So we have agreed to join forces with Google and Apple, to bring the best bits of both systems together.We will share our algorithm and the work we have done on distance calculation and combine that with their work, to deliver a new solution.I have always been optimistic about the contribution technology can make in this battle against coronavirus. Coming together in this way will bring together some of the best minds to find a solution to this global challenge and help to save lives.In the meantime, the NHS Test and Trace system, based on good, old fashioned human contact tracing, is working well identifying local outbreaks and helping us to control this virus.And so I want to ask you all once more: if you get a call or message from NHS Test and Trace, the most important thing is please do your bit to protect your community, to protect your loved ones and to protect the NHS by following their instructions.Now I’d like to hand over to Baroness Harding, to take you through the Test and Trace statistics."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/oliver-dowdens-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-17-june-2020,Prime Minister,2020-06-16,"Coronavirus press conference (17 June 2020)Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street press briefing. I’d like to start with the daily update on the latest data on coronavirus.The first slide shows cases confirmed with a test:7,121,976 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 140,359 tests carried out or posted yesterday.  299,251 people have tested positive, an increase of 1,115 cases since yesterday.The second slide shows the latest data from hospitals:387 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 14 June, that is down from 435 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April.  379 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 494 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.The third slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country:There are now 5,308 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 13% from6,123 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,698 on 12 April.  As you’ll see from the graphs while there is some variation, most nations and regions of the UK are broadly following a similar pattern.The fourth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus:Across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 42,153. That’s sadly an increase of 184 fatalities since yesterday.  When you measure that on a  7-day rolling average, the daily number of deaths currently stands at 146, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.As you’ll see from those slides we’re making important progress, and today marks another milestone.In just under an hour’s time, the best league in the world will be back up and running after a 100 day pause.All but five countries will be airing tonight’s games - underlining football’s global reach and the soft power of UK sport. The Premier League is returning and the world will be watching.Of course it will be very different to what we’re used to.  But there is no doubt that this is a hugely symbolic moment.An important step forward in our careful journey back towards normality, players back at their place of work, and a boost for our football loving nation.We’ve worked really hard with the football authorities, police and medical experts to get to this point. But we do need fans to play their part too.So please, look after your fellow fans and your communities by watching from home.  To keep the home advantage, support from home.All 92 remaining Premier League games will be shown live on television, and I’m delighted that I and others managed to  work hard to get a third of them on free-to-air channels.Friday will be the first on free-to-air, with Norwich versus Southampton. Then an important day on Saturday , that will be the first ever Premier League game on the BBC, followed by the Merseyside Derby again free to air on Sunday.And there will be extended highlights of all the games free to air. So you won’t have to miss a single goal.Our sports men and women have set some incredible examples during this pandemic, using their profiles to support worthwhile causes across the UK.England’s men’s and women’s cricket teams have donated half a million pounds towards charitable causes.Rugby League’s Cheshire West Bank Bears have delivered food and parcels to the elderly.And of course, England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford has made the front pages and the back pages for the very best reasons - highlighting the struggles facing many families during this difficult time but that is of course in addition to the fantastic work he’s been doing helping to feed millions of children through the FareShare charity.The last three months have demonstrated the immense power of sport. It brings us together through kindness and common humanity.I was struck by this last week when I teamed up with the His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge and some of Britain’s biggest sports stars on mental health awareness.We chatted about the need to deliver generational change in perceptions, and develop tools for good mental health - whether you’re a sports star at the top of your game, or a junior just starting out, or a fan going through a difficult period.  As we get sport back, I really think this is a great opportunity for all of us to be much more open about talking about mental health.The sports recovery was never just about elite sports. I know countless people are itching to get back to their gyms and leisure centres, to their five-a-side leagues and all their other normal fitness activities.We’re working closely with the sector to get grassroots and community sport back up and running as soon as it is safe to do so, with an aim of the start of July at the very earliest.  And as we continue our efforts to get children back to school, I want to focus on the role sport can play in improving young people’s physical and indeed their mental health.Today is an important moment in our recovery. The return of elite sport has provided a model to follow. One based which is based on close partnership working with government, sport and the medics to bring it back safely.It’s a model we are applying to other much-loved and much-missed parts of our economy - in particular the performing arts.I know they face enormous challenges, particularly given the impact of social distancing on live venues, and I am looking hard at how we can address those challenges.Over the last few weeks and months, I have been talking extensively and intensively with people from across the UK’s cultural sector to find a way through these issues - from some of our most creative directors and producers, to those running our greatest museums, theatres and music venues.An important part of this is to get performances back up and running again. We have made a lot of progress through both the Cultural Renewal Taskforce and indeed the  Entertainment and Events working group which sits within that. However, it is clear that we need greater flexibility to overcome some of the very specific and practical obstacles to the return of live performance.That’s why over the next week we will be convening experts in a targeted way - bringing together some of our leading performers in theatre, choirs and orchestras with medical experts and advisers.The idea is they will work together in detail to develop that roadmap which is so badly needed to perform safely, with a particular focus on piloting innovative ideas that may permit live performances.I know how essential our theatres, our music venues and the performing arts are to our wider cultural ecosystem.Culture is our calling card. It’s respected around the world, and I am determined to work with them and across government to support it and to preserve its world leading position.Today’s return of live football represents a significant milestone. But I hope it’s just another  step towards normality, to be followed by many more in the months to come.Thank you."
Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-coronavirus-press-conference-16-june-2020,Foreign Secretary,2020-06-15,"coronavirus press conference 16 June 2020Good evening,I am delighted to be joined today by the Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and by Professor Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford’s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health.Today I’m actually going to let them do most of the talking as they have some news to share on a new treatment for coronavirus.But I’ll start by updating you briefly on the latest data.Can I have the first slide please?    6,981,493 tests for coronavirus carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 113,107 carried out or posted out yesterday.        298,136 have tested positive, an increase of 1,279 cases since yesterday.  The second slide shows the latest data from hospitals:    410 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 13 June, that’s down from 438 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April.        385 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 513 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.  The third slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country:There are now 5,254 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 16% from 6,282 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,698 on 12 April.The fourth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus:And across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 41,969. That’s an increase of 233 fatalities since yesterday.Although those figures are very sad, they do show that we are making good progress in controlling the spread of the virus.Tests are up and cases are down.Hospital admissions are down.The numbers of patients in hospital overall - and specifically those on mechanical ventilation beds - are both down.And of course while each death is one too many, deaths are coming down too.That progress of course has only been possible thanks to the dedication of the British people as we work together to beat this virus.By observing the lockdown, and sacrificing contact with friends and families, everybody has played their part in bringing the virus under control.It is critical now that we hold our nerve – and we don’t throw away the progress we have made.On the 11 May I set out our plan to help our country recover and we are working through it, carefully and deliberately.At each stage we have only proceeded when the evidence suggests it is safe to do so, ensuring our five tests for adjusting the lockdown continue to be met.And yesterday it was great to see our shops open their doors again. Our retail sector has done a fantastic job to make sure they are Covid Secure, meaning they can open in a safe way for staff and for customers.It is great to see so many people out shopping whilst observing social distancing – and that is so important to limiting the spread of the virus.It has also been very good to see more, and more children back at school this week, with some secondary pupils returning for face-to-face contact with their teachers ahead of the exams next year.And I want to say to all parents whose children are eligible to return to school, I want to assure you it is safe – and there is no need for your kids to miss out on their education, I hope they will go to school.I know that people want us to go further – with our changes to social distancing measures and I am all too aware the 2 metre rule has big implications for schools and many other sectors, and I absolutely hear those concerns and will do everything in my power to get us back to normal as soon possible.But we must proceed carefully, and according to our plan. I am still committed to the central goal to get back to life as close to normal as possible, for as many people as possible, as fast and fairly as possible… and in a way that minimises the risk of a new epidemic, minimises the risk to life and maximises our chances of a string economic and social recovery.Our plan sets out that the next step of adjusting lockdown - for personal care, for the hospitality and leisure sector, for gatherings in places of worship and other public places – a lot more to come and that as you know will happen no sooner than 4 July.I remain committed to that plan, and will say more soon about how we intend to take it forward.Today, the global efforts to find a long-term solution to the pandemic continue, through a vaccine or effective treatment.And I am delighted that the biggest breakthrough yet has been made by a fantastic team of scientists right here in the UK.I am not really qualified to announce on this drug and its effects but I will ask Sir Patrick and Professor Horby to say more in a moment.But I am so proud of these British scientists, backed by UK Government funding, who have led the first robust clinical trial anywhere in the world to find a coronavirus treatment proven to reduce the risk of death.And I am very grateful to the thousands of patients in this country who volunteered for the trials – thank you.This drug - dexamethasone – can now be made available across the NHS. And we have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak.Of course, while the chances of dying from Covid-19 have been significantly reduced by this treatment, they are still far too high. So we must redouble our research efforts and we certainly will.But today, there is genuine cause to celebrate a great, British achievement and the benefits it will bring not just in this country but around the world.I’ll now hand over to Sir Patrick."
Transport Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 12 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-15-june-2020,Transport Secretary,2020-06-12,"Coronavirus press conference (15 June 2020)Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. Let me start with the daily update on the latest data on coronavirus:today, we had 1,056 new cases  there are 395 people in critical care  and 38 people have very sadly diedI think it’s also worth noting the week on week data, which compares Friday 5 June with Friday 12 June, just to give a sense of the trend and the progress we are making:there were 109 fewer daily cases  there were 161 fewer patients in critical care in our hospitals  and 155 fewer deathsThat’s important progress on the week before as we continue, step by step, and week by week, to bring the incidence of coronavirus down.In addition, as of today, there have been 6,866,481 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 93,163 tests carried out or posted out yesterday.This is the progress, the evidence, the basis, on which we are able to progress along the roadmap, which the Prime Minister set out on 11 May.We’re taking steady steps at each stage and our progress is based on strict conditions, and we’re very carefully monitoring the virus.Thanks to the hard work of the British people, that we’ve seen the level of the virus brought down substantially.At the same time, we’re watching the impact of every change that we make very closely so that we can monitor the trends and make sure that every step we take is as safe as possible.On Saturday, we took measures to allow individual prayer at places of worship.And in order to support the loneliest and most vulnerable in our society we’ve also allowed single-adult households to form ‘support bubbles’ with one other household. All those in any support bubble are able to act as if they live in the same household. Including spending time in each others’ homes without the requisite social distancing measures applying.I know these modest steps will provide enormous relief to many people, who have been isolated from their loved ones for weeks on end now.And today, we’re taking further steps to reopen British high streets, to get our economy motoring again, to protect jobs and livelihoods.We will also allow outdoor attractions to open, where people can stay in their cars, like safari parks and drive-in cinemas.As we explained back on 11 May, these are modest and careful steps.But with each step we take, we can monitor their effect on the transmission of COVID-19 in the country, keep the virus under control as we open up step-by-step, and build public confidence in the transition that we’re making.I say that because we can’t pretend that the virus has gone away or we’ve eliminated the virus. We know from the science, as well as international experience, that there is a risk of a second spike if we’re not very careful at this moment in time.So we need to keep up social distancing. We need to keep building up and reinforcing our test and tracing regime. And we need continue our steady progress in repressing the virus as we try to get life back to something like normal.BEIS and the Treasury are working closely with businesses large and small, right across the country, so that they are able to meet the COVID-secure guidelines before they reopen.To give you a sense of what that will look like in practice, in local shops as we’ve already seen with essential retail, you’ll see one-way floor markings and signs, you’ll see hand sanitising stations, and there will be limits on the number of people in any one shop at any one time. So it’s very much a managed process.Starting today, we’ve also made it mandatory to wear a face covering when using public transport. And we also advise people to use a face covering in any place where they can’t be sure they’ll be able to adhere to social distancing guidelines.At the same time, we continue to incrementally bring more of our children back to school. We started with primary schools, welcoming more children back on 1 June. And today, secondary schools will start to provide some face-to-face time between teachers and students in years 10 and 12.So that’s where we are as of today. And as I said, we’ll monitor the effect of these changes very carefullyThat’s the way we can keep the downward pressure on coronavirus and build up public confidence, so we are in the best position that we possibly can be to take the third step, along our road map, which will happen no earlier than 4 July.We’re sticking to our plan, we’re making good progress every week, and we’ll only take the necessary next steps when we can be confident it’s safe to do so."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 11 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/transport-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-12-june-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-06-11,"Coronavirus press conference (12 June 2020)Good afternoon.Welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.I’m pleased to be joined today by Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England.And again by Sir Peter Hendy, Chair of Network Rail, directing the restart of our transport system.Let me begin by updating you on the latest information from the Government’s COBR file.The first slide shows the latest information on infections.Results from the ONS infection survey published this morning estimate that the number of people who tested positive for coronavirus in England fell from 152,000 between 27 April and 10 May, to 33,000 between 25 May and 7 June.This is encouraging progress and suggests that around 1 in 1,700 people in the community had coronavirus during the latest period of the survey.SAGE has also confirmed today that their estimate of the R rate for the UK is unchanged on last week, at 0.7-0.9. We want to keep the R number below 1.0. R is the average number of additional people infected by each infected person.The second slide shows cases confirmed with a test:6,434,713 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 193,253 tests carried out or posted out yesterday.292,950 people have tested positive, an increase of 1,541 cases since yesterday. The graph shows a steadily falling number of identified cases on a 7-day rolling average, despite the increase in testing.The third slide shows the latest data from hospitals.535 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 9 June, down from 722 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April.392 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 571 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.The fourth slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country.There are now 5,607 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 20% from 7,036 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,697 on 12 April.As the graphs show, while there is some variation, most nations and regions of the UK are broadly following a similar pattern.The fifth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus.Across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 41,481. That’s an increase of 202 fatalities since yesterday.When measured by a 7-day rolling average, the daily number of deaths currently stands at 174, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.Although the number of deaths is now firmly down, our deepest sympathies go out to all those who have lost loved ones.Transport is instrumental to our recovery….To connect people with jobs…To help level up Britain….And even to make us a healthier, and more active nation.But as people start to travel, transport also presents one of our biggest challenges…How we protect passengers. Prevent the spread of the virus. Even as we become more mobile.Transport use may be the first occasion since the onset of COVID that we’ve shared confined spaces with others.So it’s critical that we all take a vigilant and cautious approach over the next few weeks.I’m just going to say this…If you can work from home, you should continue to do so.If you cannot work from home, you should try to avoid public transport.If you must use public transport, you should travel at quieter times of day.And if you’re an employer, you should do everything in your power to prevent staff from travelling… unless it’s absolutely vital……and please do allow staff to travel at quieter times.From Monday (15 June 2020), it becomes mandatory in England to wear a face covering on public transport – that includes trains, buses, trams, ferries and planes.A ‘face covering’ does not mean a surgical mask.Face coverings can be made at home and you can find the guidance at GOV.UK.As we move to recovery, it’s more important than ever to protect each other…Preventing those showing no symptoms from infecting others.I know there’s huge public support for compulsory face coverings…They show respect for our fellow travellers.But for clarity, transport operators will be able to refuse permission to travel where someone isn’t using a face covering…And this weekend I am taking powers through the Public Health Act leading to fines for non-compliance too.We’ll take a gentle approach to enforcement during the first couple of days.And help will be at hand.In addition to British Transport Police, and staff working for Network Rail, TfL and Transport Operators…In the coming weeks we’ll also deploy Journey Makers to assist and remind commuters of the need to wear a face covering…Plus the Safer Transport campaign will provide plenty of reminders at bus stops, rail stations and on social media.Remembering your face covering should be the same as picking up your phone, wallet or purse when you leave home.Please read the guidance, ensure you have a face covering and protect your fellow commuters.This crisis has tested our nation. Yet through adversity comes possibility…A greener transport future within our grasp.For example, through the £2 billion investment we’re making through the cycling and walking programme.The challenge is to make transport…Currently our biggest emitter of greenhouse gases…Part of the solution, not the problem.Take the aviation sector, which has had an impossible few months…Yet, despite the obvious challenges, there’s a real determination within the industry to have a greener restart.So we’re bringing together leaders from aviation, environmental groups and government…To form the Jet Zero Council.This group will be charged with making net zero emissions possible for future flights.Our goal – within a generation – will be to demonstrate flight across the Atlantic, without harming the environment…And today we’re backing a company called Velocys who are building a plant for aviation biofuels in Lincolnshire.I’m also excited about a Cambridge University and Whittle Labs project to accelerate technologies for zero carbon flight.The shared experience of fighting coronavirus has changed us in many ways.Although it has forced us apart, it has also brought us together.Although it has tested us, it has also shown us at our very best.And although it has made us reflect on the past, it’s focussed on those plans for the future.But now, as we become more mobile, we must not forget that this insidious virus is still a threat.That not only means avoiding public transport if you can…It also means from Monday, wearing a face covering on public transport.Avoiding gatherings of more than 6 people…Including to protest.I understand that people want to show their passion for issues that they care deeply about.And we must never be complacent about stamping out racism and discrimination in this country.But please. For the sake of your health, and that of your friends and families. Don’t attend mass gatherings.We’ve come a long way.As we move towards recovery, let’s protect lives, as well as livelihoods.See alsoNew rules on face coverings coming in on Monday will help keep passengers safe news story, 12 June 2020."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 10 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-11-june-2020,Prime Minister,2020-06-10,"Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.I am delighted to be joined by the Baroness Dido Harding, the executive chair of NHS test and trace. Before we turn to test and trace let’s go through the daily slides. If we have the first slide, please.This slide shows testing and the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus.And the figures show that as of yesterday there were 197,007 tests, bringing the total number of tests that have been done in this country to more than 6,240,801.And the number of confirmed cases as of yesterday was 1,266, bringing the total number of confirmed positive test results to 291,409.And you can see that despite the vast increase in the number of tests that have been carried out, the number of positive cases continues to fall, and has been falling on that 7-day rolling average, a little bit up from the very low figure yesterday of 1,003, but nevertheless continuing overall to fall.Next slide, please. This matches the data from hospitals, which shows that the number of new admissions with COVID-19, excluding Scotland, was 462 on the 8 June and this is down from 658 a week earlier on the first of June and down from a peak of over 3,000 in late March.Likewise, the number of those people on ventilator beds, mechanical ventilators, is down to 440. Down from 604 a week ago, and again, that was over 3,000 at the peak so it’s very good progress to see both of those numbers continuing to fall over recent days.If we turn now to the next slide, which shows the regional breakdown. Again, as it has throughout this crisis, this shows that the shape is broadly the same in most regions of the country and the downward trend persists everywhere, which is obviously very good news.If we turn now to the number of deaths, the final slide. The latest figures show that yesterday 151 people died with coronavirus, that’s the reported number, bringing the total to 41,279.Again, we can see this downward trend continues to come down and in fact the number of deaths over the past week is the lowest since the week ending on the 28 of March and this is good progress but clearly, clearly there is more to do.And these data show that this virus is in retreat.In summary, we’re working through our plan and the plan is working and that means we’re able to restore some of the freedoms that people hold so dear.And from the beginning of lockdown the challenge has been not just how to get the virus under control but how then to be able to ease the lockdown measures.I was really delighted by the announcement that the Prime Minister was able to make yesterday, allowing these bubbles so that single parents or those who live alone will be able to form a support bubble with one other household.I think this is a big step forward. It’s very difficult to imagine the impact if you haven’t lived on your own for 12 weeks and so I’m really pleased that we’ve been able to restore that human contact and the support that so many have been missing.And I know the Prime Minister’s announcement has given such hope and comfort to so many and I’m really pleased at the very positive reception that it’s got.To help us take more measures to come out of lockdown of course, the Prime Minister tasked Dido and I with delivering a test and trace system.Testing for the virus and tracing how it’s spread is critical to containing it locally so that we can ease the national lockdown.And it’s by isolating the virus that we can control it and we can stop it spreading through our communities.In this plan to lift lockdown test and trace is our radar if you like: it helps us identify where the virus is and trace how it’s spreading through the community.And you have your part to play.If you have symptoms, you must immediately self-isolate and get a test. It’s easy to get a test on NHS.UK or by dialling 119.If you test positive you must work with NHS test and trace to identify who you’ve been in close contact with and if you are asked by NHS test and trace to isolate, you must do so to break the chain of transmission and to stop the spread of the virus.I would even go so far as to say that participation with NHS test and trace is your civic duty.Please, do it to protect your loved ones, do it to protect your community, do it to protect the nation, and do it to protect the NHS.Today we’re able to publish some of the initial statistics about the first week of operation of NHS test and trace.Baroness Harding will take as through these figures in a moment, but I just wanted to put them in a bit of context. They paint a positive picture as we will see when we go through the figures.Firstly, remember that they represent just the first 7 days of this service and yet it’s already had a huge impact. The system is working well and as we both said at the start, we will keep improving it.It will keep getting better and I think you’ll see from these figures why we are confident that it will be world class.And I’m also delighted to say we still have spare capacity, and long may it remain so. This is a good thing. It’s a sign of the team’s success.And I just want to take this moment before I hand over, on behalf of us all, to thank Dido and her team, to thank the army of contact tracers, thank you, to thank the NHS and Public Health England who are playing such an important role, to thank the private companies without whom this would be impossible, including Boots and Amazon and Serco and Sitel.And finally, I want to thank you for your participation. It is brilliant that the vast majority of people have done their civic duty.And as we work through our plan and as we keep driving this virus down let us maintain that spirit and fortitude that has helped us throughout this pandemic.And that of course includes not attending large gatherings, including demonstrations, of more than 6 people.Now, I understand that people want to show their passion for a cause they care deeply about but this is a virus that thrives on social contact, regardless of what your cause may be.So please, for the safety of your loved ones, stay alert, control the virus and save lives. I am now going to hand over to Baroness Harding to take us all through the test and trace statistics."
Business Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-coronavirus-press-conference-10-june-2020,Business Secretary,2020-06-09,"Coronavirus press conference 10 June 2020Good evening,  two weeks ago, I set out the progress we as a country have made against our five tests for adjusting the lockdown, and the measures we could introduce as a result.And today, I want to update you again on those five tests and set out some further changes we can now make.So can I have the first slide please?The five tests are designed, as you know, to ensure that any changes to the lockdown are careful, proportionate, and safe.They combine analysis of the latest data on the spread of the disease with assessments of how well we are placed to meet the operational challenges posed by the virus.We must do everything in our power to avoid a second peak of infection that overwhelms the NHS - because that would lead to more lives lost, more families in mourning, and more disruption to our economy and way of life.Next slide please.Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.It’s thanks to the efforts of those working in the NHS that we can still be confident the NHS can cope.On 7 June, 443 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, down from 628 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,431 on 1 April.And on 9 June, 492 patients with coronavirus were in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 848 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.So that means we are still meeting the first test.Next slide please.Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.And of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, I am sad to say that 41,128 have now died. That’s an increase of 245 fatalities since yesterday.As measured by a 7-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 200, down from 300 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.So the death rate has continued to fall, and so the second test is still being met.Next slide please.Our third test is to receive reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection - the number of people catching Covid - is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.In total, 290,143 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, which is an increase of 1,003 cases since yesterday.The seven day rolling average of new positive cases found through testing is now 1,419, down from 2,416 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 5,195 in the first week of May.In a moment, Sir Patrick will talk us through SAGE’s latest assessment of the R and other evidence on infection rates.Based on the various data available, the government is satisfied the third test is being met.Next slide please.Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.Yesterday 170,379 tests were carried out or posted out across the UK, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. The total now stands at 6,042,622.Tomorrow the Health Secretary will provide an update on how NHS Test and Trace is performing.On PPE, we have secured over 150 deals with new suppliers around the world and procured 2.2 billion items of PPE to be manufactured domestically.Despite the immensely frustrating difficulties we have faced with PPE and testing in the past, this progress means we are now satisfied that the fourth test is being met - though of course we remain vigilant.Next slide please.Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS.I am grateful to the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their advice on the measures I am about to set out – and on this basis I can confirm the Government judges we have met the fifth test.Therefore, the Government is satisfied that all five tests are still being met and we can proceed with the following further adjustments to the lockdown in England.A month ago I set out our roadmap to recovery and that explained the gradual steps we would take to ease the lockdown, as the data and the evidence allows. The measures it contained were all conditional on continued progress in tackling the virus. We are continuing to follow our roadmap, while adjusting our approach as we need to, as we always said we would.Although we are tackling this virus as one United Kingdom, it remains the case that the devolved administrations are responsible for lockdown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And it is right that they move at the right pace for them, according to their circumstances.For that reason, the specific measures I am about to set out apply in England only.First, on retail, shops. This has been the most challenging period for shops and high streets in our history. Never before have all shops been ordered to shut in this way. It has now been 82 days since we asked these shops to close their doors and I know the toll this has taken.Which is why I am so pleased that, as the Business Secretary confirmed yesterday, we can now allow all shops to reopen from Monday. It is vital that establishments should ensure they are meeting Covid Secure guidelines before they reopen.That way we can keep staff and customers safe while we get retail going.Second, on social contact. I know how difficult the past months have been for people cut off from their friends and family.Last Monday, we relaxed the rules on meeting outdoors so that groups of up to 6 could gather, provided they are socially distant. We did so in the knowledge that transmission of the virus is much lower outdoors, so we could make this change in a safe way.But there are still too many people, particularly those who live by themselves, who are lonely and struggling with being unable to see friends and family.From this weekend, we will allow single adult households - so adults living alone or single parents with children under 18 - to form a “support bubble” with one other household.All those in a support bubble will be able to act as if they live in the same household - meaning they can spend time together inside each others’ homes and do not need to stay 2 metres apart.I want to stress that support bubbles must be exclusive - meaning you cannot switch the household you are in a bubble with or connect with multiple households. And if any member of the support bubble develops symptoms, all members of the bubble will need to follow the normal advice on household isolation.We are making this change to support those who are particularly lonely as a result of lockdown measures. It is a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions. It is emphatically not designed for people who don’t qualify to start meeting inside other people’s homes - that remains against the law.Unfortunately, we cannot advise anyone who is shielding to form a support bubble at this stage, given their particular vulnerability to the virus. However, I want to say I know how hard it is for those of you who are shielding, and we will say more next week about the arrangements that will be in place for you beyond the end of June.Third, on outdoor attractions. Because the risk of transmission is lower outdoors, we can open up some more outdoor attractions for people to enjoy this summer.So from Monday, we will allow outdoor attractions where people can stay in their cars, such as safari parks and drive-in cinemas to open.I am very grateful to the zoo industry for their cooperation and forbearance, and am happy to confirm that they too can reopen from Monday, provided visitor numbers are managed and safeguards put in place. That includes keeping indoor areas such as reptile houses closed and facilitating social distancing.Finally, we will allow places of worship to open for individual prayer this weekend. And I hope that will be of some comfort to those of faith who have been unable to go to their place of worship.As set out in our roadmap, the next set of changes - Step 3 - will not begin until 4 July at the earliest, as the evidence allows.I know that these changes are only incremental and that some of you, many of you, may be hoping and waiting for more.I also know that people will once again find anomalies or apparent anomalies in what people can and cannot do.And as I have said before, I’m afraid that is just inevitable when we are only able to give people a small amount of the freedoms that they usually enjoy.We will continue to remain cautious and measure the effect of the changes that we make. And as I’ve always said, we won’t hesitate to apply the brakes if that is what the situation requires.That has meant moving slower than we would have liked in some areas.It is because the rate of infection is not yet quite low enough, and because we are not able to change our social distancing advice including smaller class sizes in schools, that we are not proceeding with our ambition to bring back all primary pupils at least for some weeks before the summer holidays. Instead we are working with teachers to bring back as many pupils as we can within those smaller class sizes.We do fully intend to bring all children back to school in September, provided the progress we are making continues, which I hope it will. That is our focus and it is consistent with the approach that has been taken by many other countries in Europe.In the meantime we must stick to our roadmap.I urge everyone to continue to show restraint and respect the rules which are designed to keep us all safe. It’s only because of the restraint that everyone, you all have shown so far that we are able to move gradually out of this lockdown.So please, to repeat what you’ve heard so many times before, stay alert, maintain social distancing and keep washing your hands.Help control the virus by getting tested if you have symptoms and isolating if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace.Then, if we all do that together, we will all save lives and begin to rebuild our country.And I’ll now hand over to Sir Patrick."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 8 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-9-june-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-06-08,"Coronavirus press conference 9 June 2020Good afternoon and welcome to today’s coronavirus briefing. I am here with Sarah Albon, Chief Executive of the Health and Safety Executive.Today I want to update you on our continuing work to re-open our country’s economy.And I know this matters greatly to everyone.Before I do so, I want to take you through the latest daily coronavirus data slides.The first slide shows cases confirmed with a test. 5,870,506 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK.  This includes 102,930 tests carried out or posted out yesterday. 289,140 people have tested positive, an increase of 1,387 cases since yesterday. The graph shows a steadily falling number of identified cases on a 7-day rolling average, despite the increase in testing.The second slide shows the latest data from hospitals. 446 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 6 June, down from 624 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,431 on 1 April. 513 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 653 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.The third slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country. There are now 6,348 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 17% from 7,622 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,698 on 12 April. As the graphs show, while there is some variation, most nations and regions of the UK are broadly following a similar pattern.The fourth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus. Across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 40,883. That’s an increase of 286 fatalities since yesterday. When measured by a 7-day rolling average, the daily number of deaths currently stands at 216, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.The fifth slide shows the deaths where coronavirus was confirmed or suspected reported by the Office for National Statistics. These figures take slightly longer to compile than the daily figures as they are drawn from death certificates. They include not just deaths confirmed with a positive test for COVID-19, but also those confirmed by a doctor without a test, and those where COVID-19 was suspected but not confirmed.The first chart shows that up to 29 May, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported a total of 50,107 deaths in the UK where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. This compares to the figure of 38,593 deaths confirmed with a positive test previously reported by the Department of Health and Social Care over the same period.The second chart shows deaths by place of occurrence. Since the start of the outbreak, 62% of registered COVID-19 deaths have occurred in hospitals and 31% have occurred in care homes.At the start of this crisis, we took the necessary step of closing vast numbers of shops – all but those we regarded as essential - to try and stop the spread of coronavirus and protect the public.That was the right decision, even though there is no escaping the hardships it will have caused for businesses and their staff.To support those workers, and businesses, we put in place an unprecedented package of support including, small business grants, loans, the job retention scheme, and the self-employed scheme.Now, thanks to the efforts of the British public in following social distancing rules, we have succeeded in reducing the number of infections and getting the R rate under control.That is why we can carefully begin to open parts of the economy which were required to be closed, in a phased and careful manner.On 1 June we allowed car showrooms and outdoor markets to open.Thanks to the on-going enormous efforts of people across the country, we continue to meet the Five Tests set out in the Prime Minister’s roadmap.And the R-rate continues to stay below 1.So I can confirm today that retail outlets which have been required to be closed, will be able to open their doors again from Monday 15 June so long as they comply with the COVID-secure guidelines we published on 25 May.This is the latest step in the careful restarting of our economy and will enable high streets up and down the country to spring back to life.Of course, many shops have remained open throughout the pandemic ensuring that we are able to buy the essentials we need.And I would like to thank those workers at supermarkets, pharmacies, post offices and other essential retailers for their dedication during this period.Many of these businesses rapidly adapted to introduce social distancing early on.Including special opening hours for vulnerable people, perspex screens at checkouts, floor markings to guide shoppers and limiting the number of customers allowed inside a store at one time.In the new normal, we have all got used to shopping with social distancing.Now is the right time to apply these principles more widely, to more shops, as we continue our cautious re-opening of the economy.To support this, on 25 May, my department published updated COVID-secure Safer Working guidance for people who work in or run shops or branches in the retail sector.This has given retail businesses enough time to make sure their premises are COVID-secure, and this will allow workers to return safely back to stores, and welcome back shoppers on Monday.This guidance was developed in close consultation with both national and independent retailers, business representative groups, trades unions, Public Health England and the Health and Safety Executive.Shops should re-open once they are able to follow the COVID-secure guidelines, giving confidence to both their staff and customers that they are opening safely.This means any business that is open must complete a COVID-19 specific risk assessment and take the necessary steps to manage those risks, as is their legal obligation.As part of the guidance, we have provided a notice that businesses should visibly display in their shop window or outside their door to show their customers they have read and taken steps to follow the guidance.If a shop reopens without putting in place responsible steps to reduce the transmission of the virus, we can take a range of actions, including issuing enforcement notices. Local authorities and the Health and Safety Executive regularly carry out checks and respond to concerns from the public regarding risks in the workplace.But of course, there are businesses which still remain closed.As soon as we can, we will publish further safer working guidance for restaurants, pubs and bars, as well as hairdressers, barbers, nail bars and related services.These documents will provide practical steps to allow those businesses to re-open in a manner that is as safe as possible for workers and their customers.I know there has been a lot of speculation about when we might be able to reopen these parts of the economy and I completely understand why we are all so keen to get them back up and running – I absolutely share your enthusiasm.But we continue to follow the roadmap, which sets out our ambition to reopen these sectors from 4 July at the earliest.In the meantime, we will continue to protect livelihoods and support businesses, so that they are ready to bounce back, and play their part, in the economic recovery.And as we consider measures needed to support our economic bounce-back we will be redoubling our efforts to listen to and work with the business community.We want to build an economy which is fairer, greener, more dynamic, more innovative and which attracts investment from all over the world.So, starting this week, I am leading 5 new ‘recovery roundtables’ bringing together businesses, business representative groups and leading academics.They will consider measures to support economic recovery and ensure we have the right skills and opportunities in place for our workforce.These sessions will feed directly into the government’s work on economic recovery and will help deliver the commitments we made to the British people only last December. These now take on an even greater sense of urgency and importance.Because while we have a laser-like focus on the immediate public health challenge in front of us, we recognise our debt to businesses which have played such a vital role in combating coronavirus and keeping our economy moving.And we will work, shoulder to shoulder, with our businesses as we get ready for our economic fight back.Thank you."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-8-june-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-06-05,"Coronavirus press conference 8 June 2020Good afternoon and welcome again to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing. Today I want to update you on social care, something I know is of huge importance to everybody watching. I’d also like to welcome David Pearson to the press conference in his new role as Chair of our National COVID-19 Social Care Support Taskforce.Before turning to social care, I’d like to take you through latest coronavirus data.Slide 1 – testing capacity and new casesThe first slide shows number of new cases confirmed in the UK and also the level of testing. There were 138,183 tests done yesterday, bringing the total to over 5.7 million. As you can see in this chart, the number of confirmed cases was 1,205. And that is the lowest since the end of March and you can clearly see the 7-day rolling average also continuing to fall.Slide 2 – admissions and ventilatorsThe data from hospitals also shows a continued fall. The number of admissions with COVID-19 across England, Wales and Northern Ireland has fallen again to 519 – that’s down from 661 a week ago so we can see the continued downward trend in the number of new daily admissions. And the number of people on mechanical ventilators in UK as a whole is also falling and is now 516.Slide 3 – overall number of people in hospitalHere we can see the number of people in hospital with COVID on a regional basis. I know there’s been a lot of interest in the regional R figure in recent days. The estimate of SAGE, taking into account all of the evidence is that R is below 1 in all regions.In all areas the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is falling in all regions – faster in some areas than others. It is on that downward trajectory in each individual case and the total number of people in hospital is 6,403, which is down from over 7,500 this time last week.Slide 4 – mortalityThe number of deaths from coronavirus with a positive test yesterday was 55. That recorded figure is the lowest since 21 March. This data does tend to be lower at weekends so we do expect it to rise again in future, but you can see the 7-day rolling average continues to fall. That means the total number of deaths stands at 40,597.As I’ve said in the House just now, though the number is much lower than it has been, each of these deaths still represents a tragedy for a family and a community so we will continue all of our work to drive that figure down.I’m glad to report also that the number of deaths recorded in London hospitals yesterday was 0 and likewise in Scotland there were no recorded deaths – that is very good news for the capital and for Scotland.All of this data is pointing in the right direction and it shows that we are winning the battle with this disease, but they also show there’s further to go.Care homesI will now turn to care homes.The number of people dying in care homes is also falling.Figures from the CQC show there’s a 79% fall from the peak of the crisis in care homes the week ending April 24 to weekend ending 29 May, the latest when the data is available. The latest ONS data shows there were 12,739 registered deaths in care homes in the year up to 22 May and this represents 29.1% of all registered COVID deaths.From the earliest days of this crisis, we recognise that people in social care were uniquely vulnerable. Two-thirds of people in social care are over the age of 85 and the latest data from PHE show that the over 80s are 70 times more likely to die from coronavirus than the under 40s.I know personally what an anxious time it is, and it has been for anyone with a loved one in social care. Right from the start we’ve given guidance and financial support for care homes, we’ve prioritised testing, we’ve strengthened the links between the NHS and social care with a named clinical lead for every care home in England and we’ve asked councils to conduct daily reviews of the situation on the ground.And the social care COVID-19 support taskforce, which David will be chairing, will oversee delivery of the next phase of our plan for social care, ensuring care homes have the support, training, resources they need to control this virus. Crucially, this involves working with the care system to develop a plan for keeping staff and residents safe in the months after, as the lockdown measures are eased.David Pearson brings a wealth of experience in public health and in social care, so I am very glad to have him onboard and he’s perfect for the role of driving this forward over the weeks and months ahead.I also want to say a word about testing.Last month I announced that all residents and staff of elderly care homes in England would receive a test by early June regardless of whether they had symptoms or not. And I want to thank my team and those colleagues in social care who delivered that target on time on Saturday. We’ve now sent over 1 million test kits to almost 9,000 elderly care homes and the care homes themselves asked they have the flexibility to do the test when it works for them.And the good news is that the test results so far do not show a significant rise in positive cases, despite going through and testing all of the residents and staff. Throughout the crisis we’ve been rapidly testing any care home with an outbreak, or any resident or staff member with symptoms. And as we built up testing capacity, we prioritised testing of care homes for the elderly, making sure that every resident and staff member could be tested whether or not they had symptoms. And the reason we did this is because the evidence shows that age is by far the greatest risk factor.We will now make sure we do all of this in working-age care homes as well.So, I can announce that from today, all remaining adult care homes in England will be able to order the whole care homes testing service for residents and staff. This service will benefit residents and staff in over 6,000 more care homes.It’ll mean that right across adult social care, everyone will have the certainty and confidence of a high-quality coronavirus test whether symptomatic or not, certainty about whether or not they’re carrying the virus, and confidence that they’re doing the right thing both to protect themselves and others.Finally, this is carers week and I want to say a heartfelt thanks to each and every carer, whether paid or unpaid, for all the work they’re doing to support family and friends and loved ones, especially in this time of crisis. Your duty and your devotion to a job that you do with love in incredibly challenging circumstances – they’re a huge inspiration as we work through this crisis together.I understand what a worrying time it is and it’s not just because of the risk of the virus but because you haven’t been able to physically be with your loved ones.But that day when we can reunite is getting closer. The curve continues to come down, the NHS has been protected, our vaccine work is making progress, we are winning the battle against coronavirus so please stay alert, control the virus and save lives.I’m now going to ask David to set out the next steps in the social care action plan and the work to control coronavirus within social care and protect residents and staff that he’ll be leading."
Transport Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 4 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-june-2020,Transport Secretary,2020-06-04,"Coronavirus press conference 5 June 2020Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street’s daily coronavirus briefing.Before taking questions from members of the public and the media, I’d like to start by sharing the latest data.First slide please.The first slide shows the information on infections, and the data published by the Office for National Statistics this morning shows the number of people who had coronavirus in England fell from around 139,000 between 3 and 16 May to around 53,000 between 17 and 30 May.That’s represented in percentage terms in this right-hand chart. It demonstrates that the percentage of the population testing positive has been falling consistently over recent weeks. SAGE have confirmed that the R across the whole of the UK is between 0.7 and 0.9.The ONS survey also estimated the number of new coronavirus infections which stands at 39,000 per week which is equivalent to around 5,600 per day. And this is lower than the similar estimate made last week. So these are encouraging trends about the reducing spread of coronavirus across the country.This slide shows progress on testing and the number of new confirmed cases. In total 5,214,277 tests have been carried out including 207,231 tests yesterday. And these data on tests include both the swab tests to find out if you have coronavirus and also the antibody tests, which stand at just over 40,000 antibody tests a day.The antibody tests find out if you have had the virus. And if you have had the virus you can help make a difference because by donating your plasma from your blood that has your antibodies in it then you can help somebody who is currently suffering in hospital with coronavirus.I did this earlier today. I gave my antibodies and the process is simple, it’s straightforward. If you have had coronavirus, if you go to the NHS Blood and Transplant website NHSBT then you too can donate your antibodies and help protect somebody who is currently in hospital with coronavirus. And I’d encourage anybody who can do that to step forward.The chart also shows that the number of confirmed cases is 1,650 yesterday which brings the total of confirmed cases, confirmed by swab tests, to 283,311.This slide shows the data from hospitals. There were 694 admissions, new admissions, with COVID-19 on the latest data, which has fallen over the last week. Those data include England, Wales and Northern Ireland. They don’t include Scotland. And also the bottom data which is across the whole UK, shows the number of people in ventilator beds has fallen from 751 on 28 May, a week ago, down to 571. This is down from a peak of over 3000 on 12 April.Slide 4 shows the regional breakdown of people in hospital. And it shows that over 7,000 people remain in hospital, 7,080 to be precise. But this is down 15% from 8,285 a week ago and a peak of over 20,000 in April. The final slide shows the number of people who have sadly lost their lives. And this number stands at 40,261 on the latest information, which is 357 higher than yesterday.These slides demonstrate, although the past few months have been a time of sorrow for so many people, because of these deaths is not a statistic but the loss of a loved one for so many families. The slides also show that we have made a progress in our fight against this virus. But they also show that there is so much more to do.It shows that we must always remain vigilant.Especially when it comes to protecting our NHS, which has been at the front line of the battle.And of course thanks to an enormous national effort, we protected the NHS and prevented it being overwhelmed which in turn saved lives.And today I want to set out further that we are taking further steps to protect the NHS and especially around face coverings and face masks.Yesterday, the Secretary of State for Transport announced that face coverings will become mandatory on public transport from June 15 – with a few specific exceptions – for instance those with breathing difficulties.This doesn’t mean surgical masks, which need to be kept for clinical settings, but the kind of face masks that you can easily make at home – in fact there’s a good guide on GOV.UK.As more people go back to work, and the passenger numbers start to increase, so face coverings on transport are more important.Likewise, as the NHS reopens right across the country, it is critically important to stop the spread amongst staff, patients and visitors too.So today we are setting out that all hospital visitors and outpatients will need to wear face coverings.One of the things that we’ve learnt is that those in hospitals, those that are working in hospital are more likely to catch coronavirus, whether they work in a clinical setting or not.And so to offer even greater protection, we are also providing new guidance for NHS staff in England which will come into force again on the 15 June, and all hospital staff will be required to wear Type 1 or 2 surgical masks.And this will cover all staff working in hospital.And it will apply at all times, not just when they are doing their life-saving work on the frontline. It will apply in all areas, except in those areas designated as covid-secure workplaces.And of course where PPE guidance recommends more stringent protection, of course, that remains in place.We are upgrading this guidance to make sure that even as this virus comes under control, as we saw the falling incidences across the country, our hospitals are a place of care and of safety.We have also strengthened infection control in care homes. And we are working with the social care sector on how this approach can apply appropriately in social care too.It’s about protecting our NHS and social care, which means protecting our colleagues who work in the NHS and in social care.And I want to say this to you all my colleagues in health and social care.As we get this virus under control, it is so important that we stamp out new infections and outbreaks.And of course in health and care you do this brilliantly all the time - and coronavirus is no exception.That means that if one of your team tests positive, you have to follow the isolation advice.The natural impulse of course of anyone in care, in the NHS is the thing you can best do is be there to help. To be there for the patient.But if you have the virus, or are at risk of having the virus, the best thing you can do for them, as well as yourself, is to isolate at home.And this means that social distancing in the workplace also must be reiterated and it matters just as much as anywhere else.And I know that social distancing and self-isolation can cause big logistical challenges, and we will support you in doing what is right and necessary.All of us have a role to play here.And the last thing I want to say is this, ahead of this weekend, when I know there are plans for further protests, I want to say something to you as Health Secretary.Like so many, I am appalled by the death of George Floyd and I understand why people are deeply upset.But we are still facing a health crisis and coronavirus remains a real threat.And the reason that it is vital that people stick to the rules this weekend is to protect themselves and their family from this horrific disease.So please for the safety of your loved ones, do not attend large gatherings - including demonstrations - of more than 6 people.We all need to stay alert, control the virus and save lives."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/transport-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-4-june-2020,Prime Minister,2020-06-03,"Coronavirus press conference (4 June 2020)Opening remarksGood afternoon.And welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.I’m joined today by Sir Peter Hendy, Chair of Network Rail. Peter was Commissioner of transport for the London Olympics and the person who has helped oversee the restart of our transport system.Let me start by updating you on the latest information from the government’s COBR data file.First slide please….This slide shows data on the use of different types of transport.These graphs show significant falls in the use public transport – rail, buses, the tube in London – even before lockdown was introduced on 23 March. This is welcome, it shows the public have responded positively to our requests to avoid public transport wherever possible.The use of motor vehicles fell substantially initially and has since risen steadily, though not back to the levels seen in mid-March. Again, this is what we would expect as we have introduced some easements to the lockdown and encouraged people to return to work.One form of transport which has seen a significant increase is cycling – it is great to see people switching to a clean, green mode of transport with significant public health benefits.Second slide please…This slide shows tests and cases.The number of tests carried out or posted out in the UK has risen past 5 million for the first time, to 5,005,565. This includes a record 220,057 tests carried out or posted out yesterday.281,661 people have tested positive, an increase of 1,805 cases since yesterday. The graph shows a steadily falling number of identified cases on a 7-day rolling average, despite the increase in testing.Third slide please…This slide shows the latest data from hospitals.505 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England on 2 June, up marginally from 475 a week ago, but down from the peak of 3,121 on 2 April.604 coronavirus patients are in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 783 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.Fourth slide please…This slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country.There are now 7,312 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 15% from 8,558 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,699 on 12 April.As the graphs show, while there is some variation, most nations and regions of the UK are broadly following a similar pattern.Last slide please…This slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus.Across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 39,904. That’s an increase of 176 fatalities since yesterday.When measured by a 7-day rolling average, the daily number of deaths currently stands at 241, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.These figures are a reminder that COVID-19 still represents a very real threat…That the fight still goes on to defeat it…And that there are tragically still too many people across the country who are losing loved ones.Our thoughts are with them all.Transport leading green recoveryAs we’ve made clear in recent weeks, our road to recovery must be carefully and cautiously managed.Most importantly, we must avoid a second infection spike.This careful, deliberate approach has been central to the restart of public transport.In advance of previous easing of the total lockdown, we ensured transport availability was increased to allow for adequate social distancing.In addition, we also announced measures to help people choose other forms of transport.For example, with a record £2 billion investment in cycling and walking…As well as the acceleration of e-scooter trials, brought forward to the end of this month.Meticulous planning – alongside the considerable effort of passengers avoiding public transport – has worked well so far.There has been an absence of crowding, even as passenger numbers have ticked up… partly thanks to the work of Sir Peter.But these challenges are about to increase.We expect – conditions permitting – that the next easing of restrictions will occur on Monday 15 June.Non-essential shops will re-open and some children will return to secondary school, if it is safe to do so. That means there will be more pressure on our public transport.To help meet that demand, we’re ramping up services on buses, trains and trams; with substantial government funding.But still we need to do more.So today I want to highlight measures to help keep us all safer, and reduce the risks of the Coronavirus coming back.There are three points I want to highlight.Work from home if possibleFirst, let me reiterate – and this is important – if you can work from home, you should continue to do so.If you cannot work from home, you should avoid public transport wherever possible.And if you must use public transport, you should follow the guidance, including avoiding the rush hour.Updated guidance – face coveringsSecond, I can announce that, as of Monday 15 June, face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home.There’ll be exceptions to the rule for very young children, disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.But broadly, as we come through this phase, we’re doing what many other countries have asked transport users to do.And as passenger numbers increase, and we expect this trend to continue, we need to ensure every precaution is taken, on buses, trains, aircraft and ferries.With more people using transport, the evidence suggests that wearing a face covering offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread of the virus.A face covering helps protect our fellow passengers. It is something that we can each do to help each other.And whilst it also remains true that measures like maintaining social distance and washing your hands remain most critical, we also know that, on public transport, keeping two-metres apart is not always possible, all of the time.Indeed, the guidance explicitly recognises this fact.So, when more people return to the network, from 15 June onwards, they will be required to wear a face covering on our transport network.We’ll make these rules changes under the National Rail Conditions of Travel and the Public Service Vehicle Regulations for buses.This will mean you can be refused travel if you don’t comply and could be fined.Alongside transport operators, this will be enforced by the British Transport Police, as necessary.But I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face-covering helps to protect others, and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.Of course, frontline staff – those in contact with passengers, doing such an important job at this crucial time – will also need to wear face coverings.In the coming days, the government will work with unions, who have been supportive for which I am grateful, transport operators and police to ensure they have the supplies they need to be safe and provide reassurance to the public.These measures apply in England, and we are working with the devolved administrations ahead of implementation.Active and alternatives to public transportThird, to ease pressure on public transport, I want to update you on the measures we’re taking to boost alternative ways to travel.Now that vehicle showrooms are open again, there’s a growing range of electric cars, mopeds, motorbikes on sale…And as our economy gets moving, their popularity will continue to increase.Later this month we’ll be introducing the Fix Your Bike Voucher – worth 50 quid.We’ll have hundreds-of-thousands more bikes roadworthy as a result of this programme.Then there’s the Cycle To Work scheme which enables employees to buy a tax free bike – an effective saving of 25 – 39%.And that scheme has been extended to cover e-bikes as well, meaning that cyclists can cover longer distances by getting assistance on those uphill stretches.And this is a great time to start using them…As we redesign our street landscape to cope with millions more cyclists and pedestrians in the months ahead.The evidence is that commuters are already responding…Despite fewer people travelling overall during this crisis, we’ve seen around a 100% increase in weekday cycling.And at weekends, that increase has been up to around 200%, compared to pre-COVID-19 levels.We want to use this recovery to permanently change the way we travel.With huge levels of investment…..We’re bringing forward green transport improvements that otherwise would have taken years, if not decades, to achieve.In the short-term, whilst there’s still a threat from the virus, they’ll help millions of people avoid public transport journeys.And in the longer term, they’ll help transform our country into a lower carbon, cleaner and greener place to live.ConclusionOur history shows us how quickly we can adapt as a nation.Just as we did nearly 200 years ago, when Britain invented the railway…And just as we did in the 20th century, when we embraced the motor car…And then in the 1950s, when we launched the first passenger jet airliner, coincidentally designed and built in my Hatfield constituency.Each of these transport revolutions was triggered by a unique alignment of people and events.Brilliant engineers and entrepreneurs.Cutting-edge new technologies.Supportive governments.And the needs of citizens.Combining to bring about important change.And now we stand on the verge of a new transport revolution…This time, not limited to one particular means of travel, but rather to all forms of transport…A green transport revolution…Which will help us rebuild a stronger, more prosperous Britain, as well as a cleaner and healthier one.See alsoFace coverings to become mandatory on public transport news story, 4 June 2020."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 2 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-coronavirus-press-conference-3-june-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-06-02,"Coronavirus press conference 13 June 2020First let me first run you through the latest data on our coronavirus response.4,786,219 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK, including 171,829 tests yesterday.279,856 people have tested positive, and that’s an increase of 1,871 cases since yesterday.7,485 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down 16% from 8,921 this time last week.And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 39,728 have now died. That’s an increase of 359 fatalities since yesterday and once again we are with their families in mourning.Now that the rate of transmission in the UK has significantly fallen from its peak, we need to take steps to manage the flare-ups and stop the virus re-emerging in the UK.I want to update you on the progress we are making on three fronts to prevent a second wave of infections that could overwhelm the NHS.First, we have set up NHS Test and Trace in order to identify, contain and control the virus in the UK, thereby reducing its spread.As we move to the next stage of our fight against coronavirus, we will be able to replace national lockdowns with individual isolation and, if necessary, local action where there are outbreaks.NHS Test and Trace will be vital to controlling the spread of the virus. It’s how we will be able to protect our friends and family from infection, and protect our NHS.It does this by identifying anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive, and asking them to isolate for 14 days in order to avoid unknowingly infecting others.The system clearly relies on everyone playing their part.So I want to stress again today: we need you to get a test if you have coronavirus symptoms – a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a loss of taste or smell.There is plenty of capacity and everyone with symptoms is eligible, everyone with symptoms, so please order a test from nhs.uk/coronavirus as soon as you develop symptoms.And we need you to isolate yourself if a contact tracer tells you that you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive.NHS Test and Trace started operating a week ago. And already thousands of people are isolating who wouldn’t have been doing so before this service was introduced. They are thereby protecting others and reducing the spread of the virus.So while we are going to all these efforts here in the UK to control the virus, we must also ensure we don’t reimport the virus from abroad.So the second action I want to update you on is the introduction of public health measures at the border.Today the Home Secretary has brought forward the legislation needed to establish the new regime from Monday.And I want to explain the reasons for introducing these measures now.When coronavirus started to spread around the world, first from Wuhan and then from northern Italy and other areas, we introduced enhanced monitoring at the border in an attempt to stop the virus from gaining a foothold in the UK.These measures applied, at various different times, to arrivals from China, Japan, Iran and Italy, and required people with symptoms travelling from those countries to self-isolate for 14 days.However, once community transmission was widespread within the UK, cases from abroad made up a tiny proportion of the total. At the same time you’ll remember that international travel plummeted as countries around the world went into lockdown. So as a result, measures at the border were halted because they made little difference at the time in our fight against the virus.Now that we’re getting the virus under control in the UK, there’s a risk cases from abroad begin once again to make up a greater proportion of overall cases. We therefore need to take steps now to manage that risk of these imported cases triggering a second peak.So just as we are asking people already in the UK to isolate for 14 days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace, we’re also asking those arriving from abroad to isolate so that they don’t unknowingly spread the virus.There will be some exemptions for a limited number of people who need to cross the border, such as those engaged directly in the fight against coronavirus or who provide essential services.And we will review how the policy is working after three weeks. And of course we will explore the possibility of international travel corridors with countries that have low rates of infection - but only when the evidence shows that it is safe to do so.The third point I want to make today is we need effective international action to reduce the impact of the virus across the globe.This is the moment really for humanity to unite in the fight against the disease.Health experts have warned that if coronavirus is left to spread in developing countries, that could lead to future waves of infection coming back and reaching the UK.While our amazing NHS has been there for everyone in this country who needs it, many developing countries have healthcare systems which are ill-prepared to manage this pandemic.So to ensure that the world’s poorest countries have the support they need to slow the spread of the virus, tomorrow I will open the Global Vaccine Summit.Hosted by the UK, and will bring together more than 50 countries and leading figures like Bill Gates to raise at least $7.4 billion for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.Over the next five years – with the UK’s support as Gavi’s biggest donor – this Vaccine Alliance aims to immunise a further 300 million children in the poorest countries against deadly diseases like polio, typhoid and measles – again saving millions of lives.This support for routine immunisations will shore up poorer countries’ healthcare systems to deal with coronavirus – and so help to stop the global spread and, as I say, prevent a second wave of the virus reaching the UK.This virus has shown how connected we are. We’re fighting an invisible enemy. And no one is safe frankly until we are all safe.And again, of course this is all contingent upon each of us continuing to do our bit.And as I never tire of telling youLet us not forget the basics.Wash your hands regularly and for 20 seconds, wash your hands.Do not gather in groups of more than six outside.Always observe social distancing, keeping 2 metres apart from anyone outside your household.And I want to stress one final point which may be relevant today as the weather threatens I think to take a turn for the worse. Some of you may be tempted to move the gatherings you’ve been enjoying outdoors, indoors, out of the rain.I really urge you – don’t do that.We relaxed the rules on meeting outside for a very specific reason – because the evidence shows that the risks of transmission are much lower outdoors, much lower outdoors.And the risks of passing on the virus are significantly higher indoors, which is why gatherings inside other people’s homes are still prohibited.Breaking these rules now could undermine and reverse all the progress that we’ve made together.I have no doubt that that won’t happen, I’ve no doubt that that won’t happen. I think the British public will continue to show the same resolve in fighting the virus as they have throughout the outbreak.We will get through this if we stay alert, control the virus, and in doing so save lives."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 1 June 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-2-june-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-06-01,"Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing. In keeping with the new format, I’ll go through the slides now and then we’ll take questions from members of the public and from journalists.Slide one shows the testing capacity and the number of new cases. The top chart in the slide shows the number of tests. That number of tests as of 2 June was 135,643. This is different to testing capacity which stands at just over 200,000.As I said yesterday, this demonstrates that there is spare capacity in testing. So if you have symptoms of coronavirus, that’s a fever or a new dry cough or a change in your sense of taste or smell, then please do go and get a test from nhs.uk/coronavirus or by phoning 119. It’s incredibly important that we can trace the virus by ensuring that anybody with symptoms has a test. And of course we’re rolling out testing across care homes and making sure staff in hospitals get the opportunity to be tested as well.The bottom chart on the slide shows the number of confirmed cases. This is 1,613 as of 2 June. This brings the total number of cases confirmed in the UK to 277,985. Although the 1,613 figure is slightly higher than yesterday we can see that the 7-day rolling average continues to fall.The data from hospitals show that those new admissions to hospitals in England has fallen to 436. This is down from 471 on 24 May, so just over a week ago, and down from a high of 3,121 on 2 April. This figure of 436 admissions to hospitals in England with COVID-19 is the lowest figure since 20 March. It demonstrates once again that we are making progress against this disease. Again, as yesterday the proportion of mechanical ventilators, ventilated beds that are occupied by patients with coronavirus remains at 9%.Just like yesterday, the number of people in hospital continues to fall. 7,607 are now in hospital with coronavirus and that is falling, broadly falling in each part of the country, but for a little bit of day-to-day movement in some of the areas, for instance as you can see right at the end of the chart for the North East and Yorkshire. But we keep that very closely under review. But the overriding trend, as you can see, is downwards.The next slide is the number of deaths and sadly on the 2 June [correction: 1 June], yesterday, 324 deaths with coronavirus were recorded taking the total to 39,369. We mourn each one of these. We try to keep these data as accurate as possible, including where we find, in the past, in some cases there are deaths where we discover there has been a connection to coronavirus and we add those into those data. So again we can see that the trend is broadly down but there is still some way to go. And after the weekend effect, which we’ve seen each weekend in terms of the number of deaths recorded, because this is according to the date these are recorded, we’ve seen that rise on most Mondays and sadly the figure is 324 today.The final slide reports on data from the Office for National Statistics which was reported this morning and reported a total of 48,106 deaths in the UK where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. You can see again that this number is falling. The top chart shows those data and where we were on the recorded daily deaths data for the period that corresponded to these data coming from the ONS. On the bottom chart we can see the place of occurrence of those deaths. You can see both the number of deaths and the proportion of deaths that are in care homes, both of those are falling. 27.3% of deaths occurred in care homes in the latest ONS data to the week of 22 May, bringing the proportion overall of deaths in care homes down to 32.5%.We don’t capture in these charts, but we do capture in a report published by Public Health England today further data, some of which are much more troubling. The PHE investigation into the way in which the virus targets people unequally and disproportionately has been put on the website. This is a particularly timely publication because right across the world people are angry about racial injustice and I get that. Black lives matter and I want to say this to everyone who works in the NHS and in social care. I value the contribution that you make, everybody equally. And I want to say it right across society too. I want to thank you and I want you to know that our whole country cares about your wellbeing. And I value too those who come to our country to work in the NHS and in social care. And I love that this country is one of the most welcoming and tolerant and diverse. That goes for the whole country and it goes especially for the health and care system.As I said in the House of Commons earlier, PHE’s investigation found that age is the biggest risk factor for coronavirus, next gender, living in a city is a risk and being black or from a minority ethnic background is also a significant risk factor. There is much more work to do to understand what is driving these disparities and how the different risk factors interact and we are absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this and find ways of closing that gap. I’m delighted that Kemi Badenoch, the Minister for Equalities, will be taking this work forward, working with PHE and many others.We value the contribution from everyone to fighting this virus. Everyone has a contribution to make. Of course, the thing that every single person can do is to make their personal contribution to fighting this virus. In the first instance things as simple as washing your hands, following the social distancing rules and of course if you have symptoms please self-isolate immediately and get tested to protect your friends and family. So let’s keep going and we’ll get through this. We’ll now turn to questions."
Communities Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 31 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-1-june-2020,Communities Secretary,2020-05-31,"Delivered on:       1 June 2020 (Original script, may differ from delivered versionGood afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.We’re going to do things slightly differently today. I’m going to go through the charts. I’m joined by Professor John Newton from the test and trace programme. We’ll then answer questions from the public and from journalists.If there’s one message that we have today it’s that it is incredibly important for anybody who has symptoms of coronavirus – a cough or a fever or a change in your sense of taste or smell – that you get a test.It’s by people coming forward to get a test, which you can get on nhs.uk/coronavirus or by dialling 119. It’s by getting those tests that we’re able to identify those who have the virus, ensuring you get the best possible treatment and ensuring that we can then trace the virus and through that we can control the virus.That is the most important message and what everyone can do to help control this virus.The first slide shows testing capacity and new cases. Yesterday there were 128,437 tests in the UK, meaning there has been a total 4.48 million tests carried out since the start of this crisis. Of course testing capacity stands at a higher level, 206,444.This shows there is extra capacity for more tests and tests are available right now on the website if you go to nhs.uk/coronavirus or dial 119. I want to highlight that because it’s so important that people come forward for a test and anyone who needs a test can get a test.The next chart shows that there are 1,570 cases confirmed as of yesterday. This is the lowest number since 25 March. In total, 276,332 cases have been confirmed. But this number of 1,570 shows that we’ve seen continued downward progress is the number of new confirmed cases.We’re getting this virus under control, which is why we can make the cautious, small, positive steps we’ve been able to make today. If we look at the number of admissions to hospital with COVID-19, 479. That’s down from a peak of 3,121 on 2 April. The proportion of people on mechanical ventilators, the number which corresponds to that 9% figure, is that there are 606 people on mechanical ventilators. Again, that is the lowest since late March.The picture is repeated across the country. We’ve seen in almost every case the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 is the lowest since late March. As of yesterday there were 7,541 in hospital with COVID-19.The final slide. Sadly, 39,045 people have died with coronavirus, confirmed with a positive test. That’s 111 yesterday. Again, that figure is the lowest figure since lockdown began on 23 March.We can see from these charts the pattern right across the board, which is that we’re making significant progress, but that there is still more to be done.I want to say a few notes of thanks: thanks to our volunteer responders who in their hundreds of thousands have come forward and stepped up to the plate.Thanks to the charities and the charity groups who are working so hard in very difficult times.Thanks to colleagues in the NHS and in social care. Also to the businesses, pharmaceutical companies and diagnostic companies, without whom we simply couldn’t have mounted this response.To the pharmacists and the dentists, and I’m very pleased that dentistry is going to restart from next week. Especially for their hard work and their understanding, all of the families who stand behind those who are on the frontline.At the start of pride season, I want to take a moment when we can’t get together as we normally would to thank all colleagues in the LGBT community who do so much in the NHS and across social care.I think this data shows that the action plan is working. The data shows that we’re winning the battle against coronavirus.Today, we’re therefore able to make some cautious changes to the lockdown rules, carefully and safely. Of course these are balanced judgements and we take these decisions very carefully.We must all remember that, in the war against this virus, we are all on the same side. We’ve come so far together, we can take these steps together. But do not step too far. The disease is not done yet. We mustn’t throw away the progress that has been made.Please take your responsibility seriously. If you have symptoms you must get a test and if the NHS asks you to isolate you must do so.To everybody, stay alert, control the virus and save lives."
"Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 May 2020",https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/communities-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-31-may-2020,"Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary",2020-05-30,"videoAs Communities Secretary, I will be updating you on our support for the most vulnerable people in society, I’ll be updating you on how we’re shielding people from coronavirus in England, and the next steps in our programme of support for rough sleepers during this pandemic.But first, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.4,285,738 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 115,725 tests carried out yesterday  274,762 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,936 cases since yesterday  7,639 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down 15 % from 8,945 this time last week  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 38,489 have now died. That’s an increase of 113 fatalities since yesterday.Behind each of those deaths is a mourning family, and heartbroken friends and loved ones. Our thoughts and prayers, as ever, are with all of them.At the start of this pandemic, we advised Clinically Extremely Vulnerable people to shield until the 30 June. These are individuals who are most at risk of severe illness if they contract the virus – so protecting them has been especially important during the pandemic.I think it’s important to explain who is shielding.They are not exclusively older people. Over half are under 70. Over 90,000 of them are actually children and they sadly will not be able to return to school tomorrow if their year group is. And hundreds of thousands of those shielding are – or were – at work before the pandemic. Many of these people are working from home, but where this is not possible, they are unable to do the jobs I am sure they would wish to be doing.The one thing they all have in common is that they have made a huge sacrifice. I would like to echo the Prime Minister in recognising the resilience of people shielding across the country and express our admiration for their ongoing efforts.We know that they often live with other people, so this has had profound impact on their lives as well – and family members have often had to sacrifice a lot to protect the people they love the most. And I know that a significant number of those shielding haven’t left the house at all for 9 or 10 weeks – that is quite an extraordinary restriction on their lives.For those who were advised to shield, we set up the National Shielding Service, a huge logistical exercise, unprecedented since the Second World War.This has included delivering over two and half million free food boxes, securing priority supermarket delivery services, ensuring people could get medicines delivered to their doorstep, and working closely in partnership with local government and our fantastic NHS volunteer responders helping people in a myriad of other ways, be that delivering shopping, calling people for a ‘check in and chat’ or providing essential care.Over 350,000 who are shielding have registered for some support from government, like food, like medicine deliveries. But more than half of those shielding have also said to us they want someone to talk to over the phone – so none of us should forget the emotional burden isolation places upon people, and the effects on mental health and general wellbeing.For anyone, shielding or not, it’s important you seek the help you need. And it is available despite the restrictions. So please, if this is you go to GOV.UK or the Every Mind Matters website for advice and practical steps as to what you can do and the support that’s available for your wellbeing during this time.I am immensely grateful to all of those in the NHS who have and continue to go above and beyond to support those most at risk during the virus.We also recognise the role of local councils and parish councils, who have supported their residents with great effect.When we announced a gradual relaxation of restrictions in the last week, I know that many people who are shielding will have been asking: what about me?Today we are setting out the next steps for the shielded.Now that we’ve passed the peak and the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community has reduced significantly, we believe that the risk to those shielding is lower, as it is proportionately for the general population.As with the guidance for shielded people more generally, we want to give people the information and advice they need to make the best decisions for them. This is, as always advisory, for the shielded.So, as a first step, I can announce today that we have updated the shielding guidance so that from tomorrow, Monday the 1st  of June, people will be advised that they can take initial steps to safely spend time outdoors. This guidance is for England only but we are working very closely with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who will issue their own guidance in due course.Those shielding will be able to spend time outdoors with members of their own household or, if they live alone, with one person from another household.This reflects a lower risk of transmission outdoors, as well as the significantly reduced prevalence of COVID-19 in the community. The full guidance will be uploaded to GOV.UK later today.You must still follow social distancing guidelines and remain at a 2 metre distance from others.This will enable those shielding to see loved ones, like children and grandchildren.Something many I know, are aching to do.Having spent many weeks indoors, some will understandably be very cautious and concerned about going outdoors. You should only do what you are comfortable with.In our road map we set out, while the shielding guidance is currently in place until the end of June, it may need to be extended beyond that point. Our guidance to those who are shielding will always be advisory, but it is also critical that it is based on the most up to date evidence and data.So today, I can say that as part of each review for the social distancing measures for the wider population, we will also review the risks for the clinically extremely vulnerable and assess whether, as we currently believe, the shielding period needs to be extended, and whether it is possible for the shielding guidance to be eased further.We will base each assessment on clinical advice from our medical experts, and the best data available about the prevalence of COVID-19 within the community.The next review of shielding measures will take place the week commencing 15 June and will consider the next steps for the programme more generally beyond 30 June.Following that review, the NHS will also write to all individuals on the shielding patient list with information about next steps on shielding advice and the support that will be available to them.If the conditions become less favourable, our advice to those being asked to shield will unfortunately need to be tightened.The Government will continue to ensure that support is available to those who need it for as long as possible and for as long as people are advised to follow shielding guidance.Once again, can I thank all those shielding for your patience and fortitude thus far. Everyone in the country appreciates the unique challenges you face, and we want to continue to do all we can to ensure that whilst you may be at home, shielding, you are not alone.Secondly, I wanted to provide an update on our work on rough sleeping. And I’m joined by the Prime Minister’s advisor on rough sleeping, Dame Louise Casey.From the start of this pandemic, we believed we had a special duty to protect the most vulnerable people in our society. And this was especially necessary for those people sleeping rough on our streets.Working hand-in-hand with charities and local councils, we have offered accommodation to over 90% of rough sleepers known to us at the start in order to help them stay to safe during the pandemic.I want to thank everyone who has been involved in this huge national effort. Thousands of lives have been protected as a result of your work.We’ve ensured councils in England have the funding to help continue housing rough sleepers in emergency accommodation as part of the £3.8 billion we’ve provided them in the last 2 months. And we will continue to fund this essential work to get the job done.But, as we enter the next phase in our fight against coronavirus, it is right that we start to look ahead.Our goal has always been that as few people as possible return to the streets. But words and promises are not enough.Because of the action we have already taken, for the first time, in my lifetime, we know who the vast majority of rough sleepers are and where they are living.That means we can assess each individual’s needs and tailor the support we provide next. Some people will need help to return to the private rental sector, but others will need accommodation to be provided so they can start to rebuild their lives.That is why 6,000 new supported homes will be made available for rough sleepers, providing safe accommodation for people we have helped off the streets during the pandemic.The government is backing this effort with £433 million to fast-track the safe accommodation desperately needed to ensure as few rough sleepers as possible return to the streets.3,300 of these new homes will become available in the next 12 months, and £160 million will be spent this year to deliver that.But rough sleeping is as much a health issue as it is a housing issue – it is a crisis of addiction and mental health as well.So we will provide specialist support staff for rough sleepers in this new accommodation to ensure they can continue to receive the health support they will need to transform their lives and fulfil their potential.These homes will be a springboard to better things. And they will serve as a new national asset and be a symbol of hope and our belief that no one’s path is predetermined.I’m now going to pass over to Dame Louise Casey."
Chancellor's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 29 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/oliver-dowdens-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-30-may-2020--2,Chancellor,2020-05-29,"Watch Oliver Dowden’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 May 2020Let me begin with the latest figures:4,171,408 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 127,722 tests carried out yesterday;  272,826 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,445 cases since yesterday;  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 38,376 have now died. That’s an increase of 215 fatalities since yesterday. This new figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.Of course, every one of those deaths is a tragedy, for the family involved and our thoughts are with all of them.As the Chancellor outlined yesterday, those numbers show we are now past the peak and as we continue to flatten the curve, we are able to start reopening parts of the economy. We are also looking at how to begin relaxing other measures so that we can reestablish some normality in other parts of our lives.Which brings me to something which many people have been eagerly awaiting news about – that’s the return of live sport.More than two months after sport stopped, and after weeks of round-the-clock discussions with medical experts and professional sports bodies, I’m delighted to announce today that the government has published guidance which allows competitive sport to resume behind closed doors from Monday at the earliest, and crucially, only when it is safe to do so.It’s up to each individual sport to decide exactly when to resume competition. They know their sports best.But football, tennis, horse racing, Formula One, cricket, golf, rugby, snooker and others – all are set to return to our screens shortly, with horse racing first out of the gate in the North East next week.It’s been a huge challenge to get to this point. We’ve taken a forensic, clinician-led approach, working with Public Health England and the Department of Health every step along the way.We’ve had dozens of meetings, and published pages of detailed guidance outlining first how to get elite athletes back into socially-distanced training, and then back into close-contact training.Throughout all of this, we’ve put the safety of the athletes, coaches and support staff first and foremost. And by working so closely with the sports themselves, we have made sure this has been a collaborative, consensual effort to create the safest possible environments for everyone involved.The guidance outlines various measures that need to be in place for an event to go ahead, and to keep everyone involved safe. That includes a screening process for coronavirus symptoms at the venue, a one-way system for people and vehicles, minimising the use of dressing rooms, and of course, maintaining social distancing wherever that is possible.And as all sports fully recognise, ensuring the mental health of their athletes and staff is as important as their physical health, particularly in these very difficult times. Our guidance today reinforces that.It’s taken a lot of hard work to get us here today, so thank you to everyone those involved. It will be welcome news for many.Much of the media attention has focused on football, because it has a special place in our national life. Recognising its significance, I set two challenges for football’s return: first that a reasonable number of remaining Premier League games would be broadcast free-to-air, and second that the financial benefits of returning would be shared throughout the entire football family.I’m glad to confirm today that a third of the matches to finish the season will now be free to view, including the Liverpool v Everton derby. Live Premier League football will be on the BBC for the first time in its history. This is an open invitation to all fans to be part of this significant moment in our sporting history. It also of course has the really serious public health benefit of encouraging people to watch at home, which will be essential.Getting the top leagues back up and running will also release much needed funding to support clubs lower down, many of whom are cornerstones of their local communities.With both of these benefits, I can now make it official: Football is coming back.Of course, these headline sporting events are only one part of the story.I’m keenly aware that even as we reopen some domestic competitive fixtures, not all events will be back on.And given the deserved momentum that had built up behind women’s sport after the football, cricket and netball world cups, I will be working hard with the Sports Minister to make sure we don’t lose any of that progress. Visibility matters. Our daughters deserve to see female athletes on the main stage.Now our focus is also on how we can get grassroots sport back up and running safely, so that people can reunite with their local teammates.While those teams can’t compete together yet, today I’m glad to confirm that we are also relaxing the rules on exercise further, so that from Monday people will be able to exercise with up to five others from different households, crucially so long as they remain 2 metres apart.That means people who play team sports can train together and do things like conditioning and fitness sessions that don’t involve physical contact.It’s another vital and important step in the right direction.We’ve all become a nation of early morning walkers, Wicks workout-ers and evening park runners. Many of us have discovered how valuable and therapeutic physical activity can be and, I hope, we will continue to make more time for it even as life gradually returns to normal.We still have a way to go. But for a sport-loving nation, today really is a significant milestone. We won’t be sitting in the stands for a while, and things will be very different to what we’re used to. But live sport will be back on our screens next week. The British sports recovery has begun."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 28 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/chancellors-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-29-may-2020,Prime Minister,2020-05-28,"Coronavirus press conference 29 May 2020.Good evening.I’m joined here in Downing Street by Professor Steve Powis, Medical Director of NHS England.Let me begin with the latest figures:    4,043,686 tests have been carried out in the UK, including 131,458 tests yesterday        271,222 people have tested positive, an increase of 2,095 cases since yesterday        sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 38,161 people have now died        that’s an increase of 324 fatalities since yesterday  Our thoughts, as always, are with the family and friends of those who have lost their lives.Today’s figures confirm what the PM has said:We are past the peak. We are flattening the curve. We have protected the NHS and the number of deaths is falling.Over the coming weeks, we can now take careful but deliberate steps to reopen our economy.Across the country, office lights will be turned on and windows thrown open.Work clothes and school uniforms will be pulled out of the wardrobe.Shops and factories will start to hum with activity.As we enter this new phase, things will change.Businesses will need to become Covid secure to protect staff and customers.We will all need to stay alert as we go about our daily lives.And, as Britain returns to work, we need to adapt the emergency programmes we put in place to bridge through the crisis.Because of those programmes, our economic prospects are better than they otherwise would have been.We have provided:    tens of billions of pounds of tax cuts, tax deferrals, cash grants and discounted loans for businesses.        income protection for millions of the self-employed        a strengthened safety net to protect millions of our most vulnerable people  And our job retention scheme has now supported more than 8 million jobs and over a million businesses.No British Government, Labour or Conservative, has ever done anything like this.I believe it has made a real difference.But as we reopen the economy, there is broad consensus across the political and economic spectrum:The furlough scheme cannot continue indefinitely.Two weeks ago, I outlined the principles of my approach:    the furlough scheme will remain open all the way until October        we will ask employers to start contributing, as we also introduce flexible furloughing        and employees will see no change to their level of support  As promised, I can provide more details today.I believe it is right, in the final phase of this eight-month scheme……to ask employers to contribute, alongside the taxpayer, towards the wages of their staff.But I understand, too, that businesses and employers have been through an incredibly difficult time.So I have decided to ask employers to pay only a modest contribution, introduced slowly over the coming months.In June and July, the scheme will continue as before, with no employer contribution at all.In August, the taxpayer contribution to people’s wages will stay at 80%.Employers will only be asked to pay National Insurance and employer pension contributions……which, for the average claim, account for just 5% of total employment costs.By September, employers will have had the opportunity to make any necessary changes to their workplaces and business practices.Only then, in the final two months of this eight-month scheme, will we ask employers to start paying towards people’s wages.In September, taxpayers will pay 70% of the furlough grant, with employers contributing 10%.In October, taxpayers will pay 60%, and employers will contribute 20%.Then, after eight months of this extraordinary intervention……of the government stepping in to help pay people’s wages, the scheme will close.The biggest request I’ve heard from businesses large and small, right across our country, is to have the flexibility to decide what is right for them.So, to protect jobs, and help businesses decide how quickly to bring their workforce back, we are introducing a new, more flexible furlough.This is a critical part of our plan to kickstart the economy.The financial security of the furlough scheme has been a relief for many, but at the same time people want to work.No one wants to be at home on furlough. No one wants to feel unable to contribute.So HMRC and the Treasury have worked hard to put the flexible furlough in place not from August 1st, as originally planned, but from July 1st - one month early.From July 1st, employers will have the maximum possible flexibility to decide on the right arrangements for them and their furloughed staff.For instance, if you are watching at home and on furlough, your employer could bring you back two days a week.They would pay you for those two days as normal, while the furlough scheme will continue to cover you for the other three working days.To allow us to introduce this new, flexible furlough from July 1st, we will need to close the old scheme to new entrants on June 30th.Employers wanting to place new employees on the scheme will need to do so by June 10th……to allow them time to complete the minimum furlough period before then.Alongside the furlough scheme for employees, our economic response has also supported the self-employed:2.3 million people have now applied for our income support scheme.I know people have been waiting to hear whether the scheme will be extended;I understand people have been anxious.I can confirm today:The self-employment income scheme will be extended, with applications opening in August for a second and final grant.The final grant will work in the same way as the first did, paid out in a single installment covering three months’ worth of average monthly profits.To maintain the sense of fairness alongside the job retention scheme……the value of the final grant will be 70%, up to a total £6,570.Otherwise, there will be no changes and no further extensions to the schemes, which continue to be some of the most generous in the world.Our economic response to coronavirus was designed to keep people in work, protect people’s incomes, and support businesses.All to give us the best chance of recovering quickly as the economy reopens.These measures have been on a scale unmatched by any government in recent history.But I do want to acknowledge that we haven’t been able to support everyone in the exact way they would want.I understand some people have felt frustrated. But you were not and have not been forgotten.Even if you don’t qualify for the furlough or self-employment schemes, we’ve provided a wide range of support……from discounted loans, to tax cuts, mortgage holidays and enhanced welfare.Now, our thoughts, our energies, our resources must turn to looking forward, to planning for the recovery.And we will need the dynamism of our whole economy as we fight our way back to prosperity.Not everything will look the same as before.It won’t be the case that we can simply put the key in the lock, open the door, and step into the world as it was in January.We will develop new measures to grow the economy, to back business, to boost skills, and to help people thrive in the new post-Covid world.Today, a new national collective effort begins: to reopen our country and kickstart our economy.Thank you."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 27 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-on-the-five-tests-28-may-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-05-27,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 28 May 2020:Coronavirus press conference 28 May 2020.Good evening,Before I set out our next steps in the fight against the coronavirus, let me update you on the latest data:3,918,079 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 119,587 tests carried out yesterday;  269,127 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,887 cases since yesterday;  8,560 people are in hospital with coronavirus, down 11% from 9,607 this time last week.  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 37,837 have now died. That’s an increase of 377 fatalities since yesterday and we are with their friends and family in mourning.As you know, we have set five tests which must be met before adjusting the lockdown - as set out on the first slide.It is vital that these tests are met before any changes are made, because we must not risk all the hard work and sacrifice of the British people.At all times we are informed by the data and evidence, about the spread of the virus and the impact of the measures taken so far.I will now take you through our latest assessment of progress against each of the five tests.Next slide please.Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.At the start of the outbreak, there was significant concern that the NHS would not be able to cope. That turned out not to be the case, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone who works in the NHS. And the heroic efforts of the British people to contain this virus.The data show that on 26 May, 475 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus - down from a peak of 3,121 on a single day, on 2 April.On 27 May, 11% of mechanical ventilator beds in the UK were occupied by patients with coronavirus, down from a peak of 41% on 10 April.This significant progress means we are meeting the first test.Can I have the next slide please.Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.As measured by a seven-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 256, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.While every death is one too many, it is now the case that there has been a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, and so the second test is being met.Next slide please.Our third test is to receive reliable information, reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection - the number of people catching Covid - is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.And in the last seven days, an average of 2,312 new cases were confirmed with a positive test, that’s down from a peak of 5,066 in the first week of May.Based on the various data available, the Government is satisfied that the third test is being met.And in a moment, Sir Patrick will tell us more about other methods of measuring infections, including the R number.Next slide please.Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.I fully acknowledge the difficulties on testing and PPE that we have faced since the start of the outbreak. It has been immensely frustrating, but we are now making progress.Yesterday we carried out 119,587 tests, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. Testing capacity has now increased to 161,214 a day.We have now signed over 100 new deals with PPE suppliers around the world. Here in the UK, thanks to the efforts of Lord Deighton and his team and the brilliance of domestic manufacturers we have signed contracts for over two billion items of PPE, including facemasks, visors, gowns and aprons.We are therefore satisfied that the fourth test is being met and we can start to rebuild stocks - though we recognise there may be some settings that require urgent restocking on occasion.Can I have the next slide please.Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS.I am very grateful to the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their assessments of the measures I am about to set out on schools, retail and social contact. Although all parts of the UK are moving in the same direction, it is important to note health is devolved and different parts of the UK are quite properly all moving at different speeds.This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious.It is thanks to the caution we have shown so far that all five tests are being met. That is not my achievement or the government’s achievement - it is your achievement, only possible thanks to your resolve and dedication to our national purpose to overcome this virus.So the result is we can move forward with adjusting the lockdown in England on Monday.Firstly, as I set out on Sunday, we will now reopen schools to more children. Closing schools has deprived children of their education, and as so often it is the most disadvantaged pupils who risk being hardest hit.On Monday we will start to put this right - in a safe way - by reopening nurseries and other early years settings and reception, year one and year six in primary schools.A fortnight later on 15 June, secondary schools will begin to provide some face-to-face contact time for years 10 and 12.Secondly, we will also start to reopen shops as we restart our economy.We will begin, on Monday, with outdoor retail and car showrooms, where social distancing is generally easier.And a fortnight later on 15 June, we intend to reopen other non-essential retail - but only provided the five tests are still being met and shops have been made Covid secure.Lastly, I know the toll that lockdown has taken on families and friends who have been unable to see each other.So from Monday we will allow up to six people to meet outside - provided those from different households continue strictly to observe social distancing rules by staying two metres apart.At the moment, as you know, people can meet in parks but not in private gardens. This was a cautious first step - but we know that there is no difference in the health risk. So we will now allow people to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces.These changes mean friends and family can start to meet their loved ones - perhaps seeing both parents at once, or both grandparents at once. I know that for many this will be a long-awaited and joyful moment.But I must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with.Minimising contact with others is still the best way to prevent transmission. You should also try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession - so that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus.And it remains the case that people should not be inside the homes of their friends and families, unless it is to access the garden.I should add that, at this stage, I am afraid that those who have been asked to shield themselves should continue to do so.I want to say to those extremely clinically vulnerable people who are being shielded that I do understand how difficult this has been for you, especially. And I want to thank you for all the efforts you have gone to - because your actions have helped the NHS to cope.We are looking carefully at how we can make your life easier, and how we can better support you, and we want to say more on that soon.I want to reassure everyone that we can make all of the changes I have outlined in a safe way.We know that children, and particularly young children, are much less likely to be seriously affected by the virus.We know that if shops enforce social distancing, as required by our Covid secure guidelines, then the virus is less likely to spread.And crucially, we know that transmission of the virus is far lower outdoors, so we can confidently allow more interaction outside.I understand people will have questions as to how to do all of this safely - and we will publish guidance on these changes to help people, to help you, make the most of them.Now inevitably, there may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules. And clearly what we’re proposing is still just a fraction of the social interaction each of us would normally enjoy.I know many of you will find this frustrating - I am sorry about that. But I’m afraid it is unavoidable, given the nature of the invisible enemy we are fighting.It is a complex problem and we are asking for everyone’s patience as we work through it together. We will inevitably not get everything right first time.But I must ask everyone to remember it is that same patience, the hard work, and sacrifices of the British people in lockdown that have got us so far and allow us to make the progress we have.By protecting the NHS, getting us through the peak, and getting the virus under control - we are able to deliver all of the adjustments and easing of restrictions I have set out today.These adjustments are most of those we set out to achieve in step two of our roadmap, and we have also been able to have them in place by June 1 as we had hoped.There is no doubt that we are making progress and I am hopeful that in the coming weeks we may be able to do more.Because obviously while protecting the health and safety of the British public is, and must always be, our number one priority, we must also work to restart our economy and society - so as many people as possible can begin returning to their way of life.But I want to reaffirm that fundamental commitment to the British people that all the steps we have taken, and will take, are conditional.They are conditional on all the data, and all the scientific advice, and it is that scientific advice which will help us to judge what we are doing is safe.And I have to warn you, there will be further local outbreaks. So we will monitor carefully, we will put on the brakes as required, and where necessary, we will re-impose measures. It’s important to be clear about that up front.And as before, we will see how these new changes are working, and look at the R value and the number of new infections before taking any further steps, so we can ensure anything we do does not risk a second peak that could overwhelm the NHS.And yesterday, as I hope you all know, we took a huge step forward that will enable us to keep making progress in returning our lives to as close to normal as possible, while continuing to control the virus and isolate any new outbreaks.And that is through our new NHS Test and Trace programme in England. The Scottish Government has established Test and Protect, and Welsh and Northern Irish schemes will follow next week.And I’ll now show a short video that explains how NHS Test and Trace works in England and what we all need to do to play our part.Now I’ll hand over to Sir Patrick."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-27-may-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-05-26,"Coronavirus press conference (27 May 2020)Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.I am joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, and by Baroness Dido Harding, the Chair of NHS Improvement and of our Test and Trace programme.Today we formally launch the NHS Test and Trace service. This is an incredibly important milestone for the country that I know people will want to hear about.Before I do, I’d like to update you on the latest coronavirus data:3,798,490 tests have now been carried in the UK, including 117,013 tests yesterday  267,240 people have tested positive, which is an increase of 2,013 cases yesterday  of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 37,460 people have sadly died  and since yesterday, 412 deaths have been recordedWe mourn them and we will not forget them.As I said yesterday, thanks to your effort and sacrifice we are past the peak. We’ve flattened the curve, we’ve protected the NHS.And the big question that we’re all working to answer is this:Until an effective treatment or vaccine comes through, how can we get back to doing more of the things that make life worth living without risking safety or putting lives at risk?NHS Test and Trace is a big part – not the only part – but a big part of the answer to that question.NHS Test and Trace means we can start to replace the national lockdown with individual isolation for those who’ve been in contact with the virus and local action where it’s necessary to respond to a flare up.The concept is simple. First, through testing, we hunt down the virus, finding out who is infected right now.And I use ‘we’ very deliberately. Because we all have our part to play. This is a national effort and we all have a role. If you have symptoms, you must isolate immediately and get yourself a test.Yesterday, 2,013 people tested positive.And the next step is that through contact tracing, like detectives, the NHS clinician from NHS Test and Trace and the person who’s tested positive work together to identify the possible movements of the virus, where it’s been and who else it might have infected.Then we isolate those contacts who might have been infected so the virus is unable to spread. And we break the chain of transmission.Think of it like this. The virus exists only to reproduce. That is its sole biological purpose: to make as many copies of itself as possible.If we can thwart that purpose, we can control the virus and ultimately defeat it.We must all follow the NHS Test and Trace instructions, because this is how we control the virus and protect the NHS and save lives.Some people have asked why now? Why not launch this programme earlier in the course of the pandemic?The answer is because we needed to flatten the curve.Right at the start of this epidemic, we had a contact tracing system in place.But, as the virus raged towards its peak, the number of infections grew so large that we needed a national lockdown. This was the only way to get it under control.Effectively, everyone in the country was contacted and told to stay at home.Now we’ve got the number of new infections each day right down, the number of contacts of those who’ve tested positive is small enough that we can be in touch with everyone we need to.And, of course, testing capacity is critical to making this work.We now have the capacity for 161,000 tests a day. And, because of that increased capacity, I can announce that we’re expanding eligibility yet further.From tomorrow, we are expanding eligibility for testing to include the under-5s so that now every single person who has symptoms of coronavirus can get a test, no matter their age.And, what’s more, to make NHS Test and Trace as effective as possible, it is very important that everyone with symptoms must isolate immediately and go and get a test.Now, I want to thank and pay tribute to everyone involved in making this big project happen.Dido Harding who has led the work, the technicians in the labs making mass-testing a reality, the contact tracers manning the phones, the healthcare staff providing expert advice and the companies who’ve helped us put it together at record scale and pace.And what really matters is this. To protect your friends and your family, testing and tracing must become a new way of life.This is being launched today in England.Northern Ireland already has a system in place and my colleagues in the Scottish and Welsh governments are working to bring in a system as soon as they can. All 4 nations have been working together to make sure we have systems that are co-ordinated across the whole country.And the instructions to people are clear:If you get symptoms, isolate immediately and get a test  If you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace instructing you to isolate, you mustIt is your civic duty, so you avoid unknowingly spreading the virus and you help to break the chain of transmission.This will be voluntary at first, because we trust everyone to do the right thing. But we can quickly make it mandatory if that’s what it takes.Because, if we don’t collectively make this work, then the only way forward is to keep the lockdown.Put better, the more people follow the instructions, the safer we will be and the faster we can safely lift the lockdown.So, do it for the people you love. Do it for your community. Do it for the NHS and do it for all those front line workers, who’ve gone out every day and put themselves at risk to keep you and your family safe.And in return for following those instructions, you’ll have the knowledge that, when the call came, you did your bit at a time when it really mattered, when the whole country, who are desperate to see their families, were counting on you to do the right thing. You did your bit to bring us all closer together, and closer to that day when we will be reunited.This system will start tomorrow morning at 9am and the first people who will be contacted will be the people who received a positive result today.This is a very distinct change on our approach and I just want to take a moment to recap the extent of the change.Today, we say ‘isolate’ to anyone with coronavirus symptoms and their households. This remains vital.From 9am tomorrow, in addition, if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace advising you to isolate, then you must do that, whether you have symptoms or not.Now, I also know that for those without symptoms who receive that call, I fully acknowledge that this is a big ask and you are going to make a sacrifice.But this is for a purpose. And that purpose is the safety of everyone. Because we know you can have the virus and spread it to other people without ever having symptoms at all.And it’s not just the safety of all, but the liberty of all that is at stake here.We are only in a position to re-open primary schools and outdoor markets – if they’re COVID-secure – this coming Monday because we’ve flattened the curve and now we have this system in place.In the coming weeks, we will gradually and very carefully move away from a lockdown that is national in scope, blanket in application and start moving towards a system that is much more targeted in scope and focuses local action on tackling local flare-ups.This will help us to restore some of the basic freedoms that matter so much to people, and doing some of the things that people are yearning to do, like seeing friends and family, booking a holiday or getting a haircut, all while controlling the virus and keeping people safe.It is a brand new service on a scale never seen before. There will be bumps in the road and we will constantly improve it.And in the weeks ahead we will ramp up the service still further. And once the system’s bedded in we will roll out the NHS Contact Tracing App that is being piloted in the Isle of Wight.And, of course, NHS Test and Trace is only one part of the answer, it’s not the whole answer.All of the action we’re taking to get R down and keep R down, it all requires us to keep doing the right thing.Testing and tracing will help us to hunt down this virus. It is one of the tools with which we can finish the job and we all need to play our part.So please, stay alert, control the virus and save lives."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 25 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-26-may-2020,Prime Minister,2020-05-25,"Coronavirus press conference 26 May 2020Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.I’m joined by Professor John Newton, our test and trace coordinator.Before I provide an update on the work we are doing to combat coronavirus, I’d like to update you on the latest figures.In total, 3,681,295 tests have been carried out in the UK, including 109,979 tests yesterday;265,227 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,004 cases since yesterday.Sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 37,048 people have now died. Yesterday, across the UK, 134 deaths were reported.But for the first time since 18 March, I am very encouraged to confirm that yesterday there were no deaths from coronavirus recorded in Northern Ireland.I want to pay tribute to Robin Swann, my opposite number, and all of those across the NHS and public health in Northern Ireland, and the people of Northern Ireland who have shown such resolve to be able to bend the curve down and thank them for all the work they have done.While the news might not be this positive every day, I look forward to continuing to work with them to keep the virus under control in Northern Ireland.Today’s figures from the ONS show across the UK as a whole, the lowest number of deaths from coronavirus for six weeks.This is a national endeavour. And whatever the headwinds, as a country we can’t let up on this.We are past the peak. We’re flattening the curve. We protected the NHS and the number of deaths is falling. We must keep our resolve.I just want to say a massive thank you to everybody, over the Bank Holiday weekend, who stuck to the social distancing rules.And to especially my colleagues in the NHS and in social care who are doing so much.Even though we are through the peak, there are still 8,802 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK.And there are still 98 NHS colleagues in hospital with coronavirus, including some of whom who are seriously ill.So we must maintain our focus. And there are two areas I’d like to provide an update on today. PPE, and treatments. Both incredibly important for the future of tackling this disease – PPE and treatments.PPEFirst, we have been working hard to build our supplies of personal protective equipment.I know how important this is, especially to colleagues on the frontline.We all heard in the early weeks of this crisis, the calls from the frontline for more, and better PPE.And we all saw the global scramble to acquire it.I have been completely open about the scale and the difficulties of this challenge - building a new supply chain from scratch and of course the operational challenge of delivery.General Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, said it himself - this is the single greatest logistical challenge he had faced in 40 years of service.And in response, thanks to the Armed forces and so many others, including so many in the NHS, we have seen a mammoth effort.We have ramped up domestic production. And I can announce that we have now signed contracts to manufacture 2 billion items of PPE here in the UK.I set a national challenge here. And I’m absolutely delighted that Lord Deighton has stepped up and is helping us to deliver it.Around the world, we have signed deals with over 100 new suppliers, including agreeing contracts for a further 3.7 billion gloves.Whilst we continue to improve the logistics, and work hard to get everyone the PPE they need, these new supplies mean we are not simply keeping up with demand - but are able to begin to replenish our stockpiles.There is a lot further to go on PPE, as on so many things, but we have made significant progress, and I’d like to thank everyone involved.And PPE is of course so important as it’s about protecting the people who protect us. We will do that for as long as this virus remains on our shores.Research and developmentNext, I wanted to update you on some of the remarkable R&D into treatments that is taking place all across the UK.One of Britain’s greatest strengths is our life sciences and research. And we are leading the world in the clinical trials being done here.As I said at this podium last week, the very nature of scientific enquiry means that not every project will bear fruit.But I am determined that we will explore every possible avenue.The RECOVERY trial is the world’s largest trial of potential coronavirus treatments.And because our NHS is a universal system, which we are all part of, we have some of the best data and can do some of the best research.Today I can announce that we are beginning a new trial, for selected NHS patients, of an anti-viral drug, called remdesivir.There have already been some promising early results on coronavirus patients, with early data suggesting it can shorten recovery time by about around four days.As you can understand, we will be prioritising the use of this treatment where it will provide the greatest benefit. This is probably the biggest step forward in the treatment of coronavirus since the crisis began.These are very early steps. But we are determined to support the science, and back projects that show promise.I’d like to thank the NHS, the MHRA, the devolved administrations because this is UK-wide, and Gilead the pharmaceutical company, for their work in making this happen.After all, it is worth remembering that in the battle against this virus, we are all on the same side.So we will keep working across the world to develop the vaccines and the treatments - and indeed the vaccines - that will help us turn a corner.But until a treatment or a vaccine comes good, there is no simple way to defeat this virus.So we must not lose our resolve.So please - stay alert, control the virus and save lives."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 24 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-25-may-2020,Prime Minister,2020-05-24,"Coronavirus press conference 25 May 2020Good evening and welcome to the Number Ten Coronavirus Press ConferenceBefore I turn to this evening’s announcements, I want to update you on the latest data    3,532,634 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 73,726 tests carried out yesterday;        261,184 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,625 cases since yesterday;        8,834 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down (12%) from 10,092 this time last week;  And sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,914 have now died. That’s an increase of 121 fatalities since yesterday. This new figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.And once again my deepest condolences go out to all those who have lost their loved ones before their time. We must not, and will not, forget them.Two weeks ago, I set out our road map for the next phase of our fight against Covid 19It is a cautious plan, informed by the evidence about what is safe, and conditional upon our continued progress against the virus.And we are making progress. Thanks to this country’s collective efforts, the key indicators are heading in the right direction. The daily number of deaths is down, the number of new cases is down, our survey evidence suggests the infection rate is falling, and the R has not risen above one.So just over 2 weeks ago, we moved to step 1 of our plan, encouraging those who are unable to work from home to go back to work, with new guidelines setting out how workplaces can be made COVID-secure.At the same time, we allowed people to spend more time outdoors and to meet one member of another household outside, provided they remain 2 metres apart.I also said we would be able to move to step 2 of our plan no earlier than Monday 1 June - a week today.We will set out our formal assessment of the 5 tests that we set for adjusting the lockdown later this week, as part of the 3 weekly-review we are legally required to undertake by Thursday.But because of the progress we are making, I can, with confidence, put the British people on notice of the changes we intend to introduce as we move into step 2.And I think it is important to give that notice, so that people have sufficient time to adjust and get ready before those changes come into effect.Yesterday I set out our intention to begin reopening nurseries and particular years in primary schools, reception, year 1, year 6, from 1 June, followed by some contact for those secondary school pupils with exams next year from 15 June. Some contact for years 10 and 12 from 15 June with their teachers.This announcement has given schools, teachers and parents clarity about our intentions, enabling them to prepare in earnest. The Department for Education is now engaging with teaching unions, councils and school leaders to help schools get ready.Today, I want to give the retail sector notice of our intentions to reopen shops, so they too can get ready.So I can announce that it is our intention to allow outdoor markets to reopen from June 1, subject to all premises being made COVID-secure, as well as car showrooms, which often have significant outdoor space and where it is generally easier to apply social distancing.We know that the transmission of the virus is lower outdoors and that it is easier to follow Covid Secure guidelines in open spaces. That means we can also allow outdoor markets to reopen in a safe way that does not risk causing a second wave of the virus.Then, from 15 June, we intend to allow all other  non-essential retail, ranging from department stores to small, independent shops, to reopen. Again, this change will be contingent upon progress against the 5 tests and will only be permitted for those retail premises which are COVID-secure.Today we are publishing new guidance for the retail sector detailing the measures they should take to meet the necessary social distancing and hygiene standards. Shops now have the time to implement this guidance before they reopen. This will ensure there can be no doubt about what steps they should take.While the vast majority of businesses will want to do everything possible to protect their staff and customers, I should add that we will, of course, have the powers we need to enforce compliance where that is required.I want people to be confident they can shop safely, provided they follow the social distancing rules for all premises.The food retail sector has already responded fantastically well, enabling supermarkets to be kept open in a safe way – and we will learn lessons from that experience as we allow other retail to open.These are careful but deliberate steps on the road to rebuilding our country.And we can only take these steps thanks to what we have so far achieved together.We will only be successful if we all remember the basics - so wash your hands, keep social distance, and isolate if you have symptoms – and get a test.I will now hand over to Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, to take us through today’s slides."
Transport Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-24-may-2020,Transport Secretary,2020-05-23,"Coronavirus press conference 24 May 2020Good afternoon.I want to begin by answering the big question that people have been asking in the last 48 hours. And that is – is this Government asking you - the people, the public, to do one thing while senior people here in government do something else?Have we been asking you to make sacrifices, to obey social distancing, to stay at home while some people have been basically flouting those rules and endangering lives?And it is because I take this matter so seriously and frankly it is so serious that I can tell you today I have had extensive face to face conversations with Dominic Cummings and I have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus. And when he had no alternative, I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent. And I do not mark him down for that. And though there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably false.I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly, and legally, and with integrity, and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.And I stress this fundamental aim, because it is thanks to this country’s collective resolve in achieving that aim that we continue to make progress.So let me give you today’s figures:3,458,905 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 110,401 tests carried out yesterday  259,559 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,409 cases since yesterday – a smaller increase than we were seeing over the last few weeks  8,951 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down 11% from 10,085 this time last weekAnd sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,793 have now died. That’s an increase of 118 fatalities since yesterday.And each of those fatalities represents a family in mourning, the grief of friends and relatives. And as we mourn them we resolve again to beat this virus and get our country back on its feet. We can and we will.Two weeks ago I set out the Government’s roadmap to begin easing the measures we put in place to control the spread of coronavirus.I said that we would do so in a safe and controlled way, based on our assessment of progress against the five tests we set for adjusting the lockdown.We’re going to set out that assessment in detail in the coming days, but today I can confirm that I do believe we will be in a position to move to step 2 of our plan.As part of Step 2, we set out plans for a phased reopening of schools.Because the education of our children is crucial for their welfare, their health, for their long term future and for social justiceAnd so in line with the approach being taken by other countries, we want to start getting our children back in the classroom in a way that is manageable and as safe as possible.So we said this would begin with early years settings and reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in primary schools.Today I can announce that it is our intention to go ahead with that as planned on June 1st, a week on Monday.We then intend, from June 15th, for secondary schools to provide some contact for Year 10 and Year 12 students to help them prepare for exams next year, with up to a quarter of these students in at any point.By opening schools to more pupils in this limited way, we are taking a deliberately cautious approach.And this comes after a constructive period of consultation with schools, teachers and unions, led by the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.I want to thank all the Education and childcare staff who have stepped up to the challenge and kept schools open throughout this crisis.The Department for Education will engage with teaching unions, local authorities and school leaders in the coming days, giving them an opportunity to ask questions and probe the evidence behind our plans.And the final decision will be taken as part of the formal review into lockdown measures which the law requires us to undertake by Thursday. We will of course continue to consider all the evidence (as we said we would do), and will continue to work hard with those bodies over the course of the coming week.However, I think it is important for us to be clear about the Government’s intentions now, so that teachers and parents can plan in earnest for schools to reopen a week on Monday.Now I acknowledge that a 1 June opening may not be possible for all schools, but the Government will continue to support and work with the sector to ensure that any schools experiencing difficulties are able to open more widely as soon as possible.Detailed guidance has been published by the Department for Education on how schools can open in a way which is safe for children, teachers and parents.While of course we recognise that full social distancing may not be possible, especially when teaching young children, our guidance sets out a range of protective measures to keep children and staff safe. This includes:reducing the size of classes and keeping children in small groups without mixing with others  staggered break and lunch times, as well as drop offs and pick ups  increasing the frequency of cleaning, reducing the used of shared items and utilising outdoor spaceAll children and staff, and their families, will have access to testing if they display symptoms. This will enable children and staff to get back to school if they test negative, and if they test positive we will take the appropriate reactive measures.We will continue to work with the sector to support them to prepare for wider opening and ensure all children and young people can continue to receive the best care, education and training possible.We will set out what moving to step 2 means for other areas, such as non-essential retail and more social contacts, over the course of the next week.And let me stress once again: we are making good progress.But that progress is conditional, provisional.We must keep reducing the incidence of this disease.We must keep that R down below 1.And that means we must remember the basics.Wash our hands, keep social distance, isolate if you have symptoms – and get a test.We are beating this thing, but we will beat it all the faster if we stay alert, control the virus and save lives."
Home Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/transport-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-23-may-2020,Home Secretary,2020-05-22,"Transport Secretary’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19) 23 May 2020Opening remarksGood afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.I’m pleased to be joined today by Dr Jenny HarriesLatest dataLet me start by updating you on the latest information from the government’s COBR data file.As of today (23 May 2020):3,348,507 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 116,580 tests yesterday.257,154 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,959 cases since yesterday.9,331 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 11% since last week.And tragically 36,675 people have now died. That’s an increase of 282 fatalities since yesterday and that’s across all settings.Not just a list of statistics, but a devastating reminder of the cruelty of coronavirus.Our thoughts are with the friends and families of the victims.Transport contextAs we start to relax the restrictions, we must plan our route to recovery….Allowing people to resume their lives where possible…Getting businesses up and running again…And building beyond coronavirus.In the short term, we will need to bring back more public transport to keep families safe.That process has already begun.Rail and tube services increased at the beginning of this week - and they’ll ramp up more next month.And to ensure that more buses, trams and light-rail networks return to service today I can announce new investment of £283 million to start moving back to a full timetable.However, I do want to stress this funding does not mean we can go back to using public transport whenever we like.Remember…Those who can should still work from home…Those who can should still avoid all public transport.Even a fully restored service will only be capable of carrying – at best – one fifth of normal capacity, once social distancing is taken into account.So only if you need to travel, and you can’t cycle, or walk or drive, should you take a bus, tram or train.But please; avoid the rush hour.MarshalsWe’re managing the transport network to make it as safe as possible.This week saw the deployment of nearly 3,500 British Transport Police, Network Rail and Transport for London employees.These marshals worked with the public to prevent services from becoming overcrowded.From 1 June at the earliest – as we move to Phase 2 of the unlock – we will start to deploy twice as many marshals with the assistance of groups like the charity – Volunteering Matters.These Journey Makers will help provide reassurance, advice and friendly assistance to commuters.The last time we did this, at the 2012 Olympics, it was a great success.While these are altogether more serious times – if we show the same public-spirited concern for one another, it will go a long way towards helping transport and passengers cope.ZipAboutAs I have said, it’s essential we stagger journeys and avoid the rush-hour.That’s why, at a recent roundtable, we asked the tech sector to come up with innovative proposals to help passengers avoid congestion.One good example is ‘Passenger Connect’ from Birmingham start-up ZipAbout.A personalised information service which tells rail users how disruption and crowding may affect their journey, while providing alternatives and helping people to maintain social distancing.The service has been successfully piloted over the past 12 months and it will be rolled out soon.Building for the futureWe’re not just dealing with the immense challenges of the present.We’re building for the future too.Transport is not just about how we get from place to place.It also shapes the places; for good or bad…Towns. Cities. Whole nations.We now have an opportunity to use the power of transport to improve long-standing national weaknesses, and create something better.Rebalancing the economyThe UKs unbalanced economy is one such weakness.Our mission is to level-up Britain.The COVID-19 outbreak must be the catalyst to get it done.Levelling up. And speeding up.So, while roads and railways are less busy, we’re accelerating vital projects.Take the North, for example.This bank holiday weekend, we’re carrying out vital work to fix Leeds station.Continuing to build a new platform…… Installing new points and switches…… And improving the track to Wakefield.Just part of 490 separate engineering projects happening around the country this bank holiday weekend.Work that would normally take months of weekend closures are much quicker on these quieter railways.Beeching cutsAnd we’re getting on with plans to reverse some of the so-called Beeching rail cuts too.Dr Beeching wrote a report back in the 1960s which led to the closure of one-third of our railway network.2,363 stations, 5,000 miles of track identified for closure.Many of the places removed from the map never recovered.That report was perhaps the origin of the ‘left-behind town’.But we’re working to reverse Beeching.The process has already started in Blyth in the North East and Fleetwood in the North West….I visited in January, and also took the opportunity to visit Horden Peter Lee to see the building work.There used to be a train station 200 yards away, but it was closed, and the town cut off by the Beeching axe.This new station will connect a community of over 50,000 people, improving their quality of life.And today, the next 10 schemes to benefit are announced.It’s development funding…… But if they stack up, then we’re going to build them fast.Amongst the many schemes is the reinstatement of the Ivanhoe line in the East Midlands, from Leicester to Burton, via Coalville and Ashby.And branch lines on the Isle of Wight, and a new station at Wellington in Somerset.RoadsBut no matter how great we make the railway of the future, millions will still rely on the car.That’s why today I’m publishing the preferred route to complete the dual carriageway on the A66 from Scotch Corner to Penrith.The first new all dual-carriageway across the Pennines in 50 years.This is a £1 billion programme that will transform capacity by upgrading junctions and widening the road.These road and rail schemes will be the first of many…Binding our country together, and connecting people with jobs.Towns and citiesBut it isn’t just the balance between regions that we need to reshape.It’s hard to see millions who - until a few weeks ago - commuted by train into Manchester, London, Birmingham every day - immediately going back to the same old ways.So we have to reshape our towns and cities too…The Prime Minister once said:  Cities are where inspiration and innovation happens … because people can bump into each other, spark off one another, compete, collaborate, invent and innovate. That’s when we get the explosion, or flash of creativity and innovation.And yet –  with social distancing  –  it makes all that rather more difficult…So we have to find new ways of making it happen.Therefore - as conditions allow and not until July – we will be looking to support creative ways for businesses to reopen, whilst maintaining social distancing.We know restaurants and bars will want to start trading again, and we will work with them so we can enjoy an outdoor summer in a safe and responsible environment.Car parkingFor those who live too far to cycle and walk, and must drive to major conurbations, we will repurpose parking in places just outside town centres…… so people can park on the outskirts and finish their journeys on foot or bike or even e-scooter.Our aim with many of these measures is not merely to get through the lifting of restrictions, and then return to how things were…… But to come out of this recovery stronger, by permanently changing the way we use transport.CyclingTake the bike for example, previously we announced the introduction of a scheme to help bring bicycles back to a roadworthy condition…… relieving the pressure on public transport, and improving the nation’s health.Today I can provide the detail of the new £50 bicycle maintenance voucher.Available from next month, the scheme will help up to half-a-million people drag bikes out of retirement.…… Speeding up the cycling revolution…… Helping individuals become fitter and healthier…… And reducing air pollution, which remains a hidden killer.Clean air should be as big a priority for us in the 21st century as clean water was to the Victorians in the 19th.Closing remarksThe measures discussed today will help…… more passengers use trains, buses and trams safely….… More commuters to take up active travel….… And more people to benefit from infrastructure improvements in the Northern Powerhouse, and across the country.They give us all an opportunity to harness the power of transport…Not just to help us return to the lives in the post-COVID-19 world…… But to make our economy more resilient.Our population healthier.And to change our nation for the better.See alsoTransport Secretary announces new measures to “keep passengers safe now and level up for the future”, news story, 23 May 2020"
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 21 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/home-secretarys-opening-statement-to-the-governments-daily-briefing-on-coronavirus,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-05-21,"Coronavirus press conference (22 May 2020)Good afternoon, welcome to the government’s daily briefing on coronavirus.I am pleased to be joined by Paul Lincoln, Director General of our Border Force, and Patrick Vallance, our Chief Scientific Advisor.First, I will update you on the latest daily figures.3,231,921 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 140,497 tests carried out yesterday.  254,195 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3287 cases since yesterday.  9,307 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down 14% from 10,781 this time last week.  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36 393 have now died. That’s an increase of 351 fatalities since yesterday.All our thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies remain with all those who have lost loved ones.At this time of national emergency, it is crucial that we remain alert to save countless more lives.That means doing everything in our power to control this terrible disease – taking the right action, at the right time, to prevent a deadly second wave.That is why I am today announcing the next step in our cross-government approach – and these include temporary public health restrictions at the border.Let me explain why we are bringing forward these measures as other restrictions finally start to ease, following two hard months of lockdown.The answer why is simple: it is to protect that hard-won progress and prevent a devastating resurgence and a second wave of the virus.We are following the science and introducing public health measures that are supported by SAGE.This will require international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days – that is the incubation period of the virus – so that if people have become infected overseas, we can limit the spread of the virus at home.And as we are taking this action, we are taking it at a time when it will be most effective.Passenger arrivals have been down by 99% compared to the previous year.Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases, triggering a resurgence of this deadly disease.As the transmission rate across the UK falls, and the number of travellers arriving in the UK begins to increase, imported cases could begin to pose a larger and increased threat.This is because they could become a higher proportion of the overall number of infections in the UK and therefore increase the spread of the disease.So, with far fewer people being infected in this country and the public having worked so hard to bring the R number down, any new arrivals entering the country with the disease during this next phase will have a much bigger impact – potentially causing a second wave.This is of course a different story from when domestic transmission was at its peak and when overseas travel was at an all time low.Led by the Prime Minister, the whole government has worked together across all departments including with the devolved administrations to develop these measures.We do not take these steps lightly.This is extremely challenging and these are difficult times for the entire nation as our freedoms have been sadly, but necessarily, curtailed.We do not underestimate how hard the new restrictions will be for people up and down the country, and also those who have already sacrificed so much to help beat and drive down the spread of coronavirus.I know that families both at home and abroad are desperate to be reunited.But, by taking these steps, we could save many more lives - making it possible for more friends and family to be safely together in the future.We also recognise how hard these changes will be for our travel and leisure sectors who are already struggling in these unprecedented times.Across government, we continue to work with them and support what is an incredibly dynamic sector to find new ways to reopen international travel and tourism in a safe and responsible way.We will review these temporary public health measures every three weeks to ensure they remain the right ones for our road map to recovery.And these measures will be introduced from 8 June, so that people arriving into the UK will be required to self-isolate for 14 days, except those on a short list of exemptions.Arrivals will also be required to provide contact and address details to help trace them should we need to.And given the amazing public spirit and the level of compliance we have seen so far we expect the vast majority of people to do the right thing and comply with these new requirements.We know that the vast majority of people will continue to play their part and act responsibly, to control the spread of this virus and stop a second wave.But we will not allow a small, reckless minority to endanger us all – so there will be penalties for those who break these mandatory measures.Border Force will be on the frontline of implementing the changes with spot checks as people arrive in the UK.Paul Lincoln, Director General of Border Force, will shortly provide an update on the steps people will need to take.I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank our border officers and staff for the role they will play, and for all they are doing to protect our nation at this deeply challenging time.We are working across all four nations of the UK to make these public health measures work, but I will now turn to the enforcement approach that is being taken here in England.We will conduct spot checks by mid June to ensure people are self-isolating.And those from overseas who refuse to comply, could be refused entry.Public Health England will set up an assurance service to contact people at random to ensure they understand the requirements and are self-isolating.And our outstanding police will continue as they have done so diligently across the country, to engage, explain and encourage people to follow the rules.We will empower them to use enforcement as a last resort.So anyone breaking their 14-day quarantine could face a one thousand pound fixed penalty notice.And, ultimately, there could be potential prosecution and an unlimited fine for failure to comply with these sanctions.We will keep these penalties under review and will be unafraid to increase them if that is required.But have no doubt: we are taking these measures at the right time because we are serious about saving lives and controlling the virus.We will be guided by the science and the health of the public and the country will always come first, which is why we are implementing these restrictions at the border now.Our absolute priority remains to stop the spread of this infection, to save lives and to stop and prevent a dangerous second wave of this virus.That also means supporting our NHS and making short-term sacrifices together, to stop coronavirus taking more lives.I will now handover to Paul Lincoln, from Border Force, who will provide an operational update and also talk about the measures and how they will be implemented."
"Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 20 May 2020",https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-21-may-2020,"Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary",2020-05-20,"Coronavirus press conference 21 May 2020Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.I’m joined by Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer, and Professor John Newton, who is our adviser on test and trace.Before I turn to the latest coronavirus data, I wanted to say something this Mental Health Awareness Week.I know how difficult the change and uncertainty generated by this awful virus has been for so many people. So many moments of joy have been put on hold. Cherished milestones, important events and time with loved ones - things that were in the diary but can’t any longer.So I want to say this to anyone who has been finding it hard.These are tough times. It is OK to be not OK. And it is normal to feel low, anxious, or unhappy sometimes.But it is so important that if you think you need it, please seek help. If you want to talk to someone, please, go to the NHS - it is there for you.And if you are a health or care worker, there is bespoke series of support so we can care for you just as you care for us - just text FRONTLINE to 85258.Mental health charities are also offering some brilliant support too. Today I am providing a further 4.2 million pounds so organisations like Samaritans and Young Minds and Mental Health UK can keep on doing what they do best.Everyone can strengthen their mental health, just in the same way as we keep an eye on our physical health, including when we are healthy.And PHE’s Every Mind Matters campaign is something that every single person can engage with and can use to strengthen your mental health and wellbeing - in good times and in bad. So let’s all come together this Mental Health Awareness Week and support each other.Turning to the daily figures…We have now completed over 3 million tests for coronavirus. In total, 3,090,566 tests have been carried out in the UK, including 128,340 yesterday tests carried out yesterday.250,908 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,615 cases since yesterday.9,543 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus. That is a 14% fall from the same time last week.Sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,042 people have now died. That’s an increase of 338 fatalities since yesterday.This is a deadly virus and it has brought pain to so many both here and across the world. But we are making real progress in our fight.I’d like to take a moment to remind everyone about our plan to defeat coronavirus and to get Britain moving once again.Slide one please.As you may have seen at previous briefings, we have now put in place our COVID Alert Level System. It consists of 5 levels, based on the R value and the number of new cases.This alert level guides the social distancing rules, which have proved to be so effective at getting the virus under control. The higher the alert level, the stricter the rules.Throughout the lockdown, we have been at level 4. As you can see, level 4 means that coronavirus is in general circulation and that transmission is either high or exponentially rising.But, thanks to your shared sacrifice, we’ve now brought R down. And now, because of our caution, we are in a position to start moving to level 3.Next slide please.And here is how we can move forward… We’ve set out 3 steps that we plan to take, carefully, to modify the social distancing rules and start to restore freedom in this country, all the while avoiding a disastrous second peak that could overwhelm the NHS.At each step, we will closely monitor the impact on R, on the number of new infections and on all available data.We are currently at step 1, which means:    if you work but you can’t work from home, you should speak to your employer about going back in        you can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like        and you can meet one other person from outside your household in an outdoor, public place, but you should stay 2 metres apart  We will move to step 2 on 1 June if we are able to do so. Step 2 involves reopening more things, like schools and some retail. And using our test and trace system to keep R down. We will only move to step 2, and then in due course to step 3, when it is safe to do so.Next slide please.It is important that we stay alert and think about what we can all do to control the spread of this virus.This means, of course, staying at home as much as is possible and working from home if you can.It means:    hygiene: washing your hands and cleaning surfaces remains absolutely crucial        distance: staying 2 metres apart wherever possible        protection: wearing face coverings on public transport and in shops        and self-isolating altogether if you have symptoms  And as we approach a bank holiday weekend, we must all renew our efforts. Over the course of this pandemic, people all across the UK have been making difficult but vital sacrifices for the greater good. So let’s not go back to square one.We can all play our part in the national effort, getting R down and keeping R down, and controlling the virus so we can restore more of the things that make life worth living.As we follow our plan, our testing regime will be our guiding star. It is the information that helps us to search out, and defeat the virus.Over the past few months, we have built a critical national infrastructure for testing on a massive scale. We have already put in place the building blocks. We have developed the test, we’ve built the test centres and the lab capacity, we’ve created the home testing kits.All this gives us clarity and confidence for the long term. We hit 100,000 tests a day on time. When we said we would. But we are always striving to go further.To expand our testing capacity, and to improve our understanding of this virus, there are 2 developments that I wanted to share with you all today.The first is around swab tests, these are the results that tell you if you currently have coronavirus. As I announced on Monday, anybody over 5 who has symptoms is now eligible for a test.Getting the test is important. But getting a quick result is important too. We are working hard on innovative developments that I wanted to bring you up to speed with.It’s really important to be clear about this. Working with innovative science always has its risks. Like all R&D, lots of the projects don’t come off.For instance, like vaccines, where we don’t know if we’ll ever get one, I’m prepared to back innovative developments even if they might never happen. And I think it’s worth it, especially in these circumstances, to back things before you know for sure if they’re going to work, and I make no apologies for that.We are working with many top names to help us deliver testing with a rapid turnaround - names like Oxford Nanopore and Chronomics and DNA Nudge.For example, one innovative company, Optigene, has produced an early test which is being trialled from today. It is interesting to us because it is so fast. It doesn’t need to be sent to a lab to be processed and so you get the result on the spot, typically within around 20 minutes.It’s already proven effective in early trials and we want to find out if it will be effective on a larger scale.And we want to support companies like Optigene, and others, to develop these sort of innovative projects. We will monitor its effectiveness very closely. And if it works, we will roll it out as soon as we can.Now this is just one of a number of innovative testing technologies that we are pushing forward, as fast as the science allows. I will leave no stone unturned and I want to thank everybody involved for their dedication.The second development I wanted to share today is around antibody tests. These tell you if you have had the virus and have developed antibodies in response, that might help you to fight the virus in the future.COVID-19 is a new virus and we are learning more about it every single day. I want to be frank with you about what we don’t know, as well as what we do know. We are not yet in a position to say that those who test positive in these antibody tests are immune from coronavirus.But as our understanding of the disease improves, the insight these antibody tests provide will be crucial. They can help us to understand how our bodies react to coronavirus, and how it has spread across the country. We are backing efforts to develop our own homegrown antibody tests through our UK Rapid Test Consortium - and that work is showing some early promise.And as you know, we have been looking at a whole series of commercial antibody tests. Now many of the early tests were not reliable enough for clinical use. But we have made some available at small scale.And we have now had the results of our antibody surveillance study. This has told us that around 17% of people in London, and around 5% or higher in the rest of the country, have tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.This was based on a sample. But for the public at large to know whether or not they have had coronavirus, we need antibody tests at large scale.Two lab-based tests, produced by Roche Diagnostics and Abbott Labs, have been given a positive evaluation by PHE and approved by the MHRA. And 3 further tests are being assessed right now. And I can announce today that we have signed contracts to supply in the coming months, over 10 million tests from Roche and Abbott.From next week, we will begin rolling these out in a phased way. At first, to health and care staff, patients and residents.The UK government has arranged supplies of these tests on behalf of the devolved administrations, and each devolved nation is deciding how to use its test allocation and how testing will be prioritised and managed locally. This is an important milestone. And it represents further progress in our national testing programme.It’s not just about the clinical advances that these tests can bring, although, obviously, that’s important. It’s that knowing you have these antibodies will help us to understand in the future if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, dying from coronavirus and of transmitting coronavirus.We are developing this critical science, to know the impact of a positive antibody test. And to develop the systems of certification to ensure people who have positive antibodies can be given assurance about what they can safely do.History has shown that understanding an enemy is fundamental to defeating it. And in this latest fight, our ingenuity and our brilliant scientists and our scientific curiosity is what will keep us one step ahead of this virus.We all have something to bring though in this fight against our common foe. One action that each and every one of us can take is to follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing. Not just for you, but for your loved ones and for your community.So please, stay alert, control the virus and save lives."
Environment Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 19 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/oliver-dowdens-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-20-may-2020,Environment Secretary,2020-05-19,"Coronavirus press conference (20 May 2020)Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s briefing. I’m pleased to be joined by Steve Powis - the National Medical Director at NHS England.First, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.    2,962,227 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 177,216 tests carried out yesterday;        248,293 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,472 cases since yesterday;        9,953 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down 13 % from 11,443 this time last week.  And sadly, of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 35,704 have now sadly died. That’s an increase of 363 fatalities since yesterday. Of course, my thoughts are with everyone of the families of those people who have been affected by this.Before we begin questions from the public and from the media I just want to remind people of the details of the next phase of our fight against Coronavirus.First, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System, with five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus.The alert level will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.And in turn that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place.The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures.Throughout the period of lockdown which started on March 23rd we have been at Level 4.Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in careful steps.We have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their normal way of life - but crucially while avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak which overwhelms the NHS.After after each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.Step 1 – as the PM announced this week:Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work.  You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like.  You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay 2 metres apart.Having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated what we are asking people to do, which is to Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives.Yes - staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible. But there are a range of other actions we’re advising people to take.People should Stay Alert, by:working from home if you can;  limiting contact with other people;  keeping distance if you go out - 2 metres apart where possible;  washing your hands regularly;  wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant - for example in some shops and on public transport;  and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate.Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections.This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.Over the past months, we’ve all naturally been focused on the huge, life-or-death health implications of this pandemic.But I’d now like to provide an update on some of the crucial work taking place behind the scenes to support and protect the things that give our lives added meaning - such as sport, art, tourism and our charities, music and theatre.And when we look back on coronavirus, one of the things we’ll remember is the incredible contribution made by so many people.As a way of showing our national gratitude to these everyday COVID heroes, we are announcing today that we are delaying Her Majesty The Queen’s Birthday honours list until the Autumn so that they can be recognised and celebrated.And as the Prime Minister said today, I’m delighted that Her Majesty The Queen has approved a knighthood for Captain Tom Moore, in recognition of his outstanding achievement in raising nearly £33 million for NHS charities.Captain Tom set a marker for generosity, and the public have matched it.Incredibly, it looks as if British people and businesses have now contributed over £800 million - just through national fundraising campaigns alone - and a great deal more has obviously been raised at a local level.As the British people have generously given both their time and money,  the government has sought to back them every step of the way. We promised to match every penny raised by the BBC’s Big Night In campaign and, after a fantastic public response, I’m delighted to announce today that over £70 million is now being distributed by Comic Relief, Children In Need and the National Emergencies Trust to charities on the frontline.This comes on top of the hundreds of millions of pounds we’ve already announced for charities doing vital work to support those suffering with poor mental health, to help victims of domestic abuse, and to make sure hospices can continue to care for families in these most difficult circumstances.And today, I am pleased to confirm that the Government’s dedicated support scheme  for small and medium sized charities - the Coronavirus Community Support Fund - will open for applications this week.Initially there will be a £200 million tranche of government funding and this will be administered by the National Lottery Community Fund and will focus on those charities we may not know nationally, but are a lifeline to communities at a local level.On top of that I can also announce that we are releasing £150 million from dormant accounts to help social enterprises get affordable credit to people who are financially vulnerable and support charities tackling youth unemployment.Our charities, both large and small, have really been at the forefront of the national effort to defeat the coronavirus. And together this all amounts to a multi-billion pound boost for Britain’s charities.I know people are also eager for news on the return of live sports and arts. The last few months have felt odd without them, and our calendars strangely bare.Finding creative, crowd-free ways to navigate coronavirus is the biggest challenge for our recreation and leisure sectors right now.So this week I am setting up a renewal taskforce which will help them bounce back. It will be made up of the brightest and the best from the creative, tech and sporting worlds. These are experts in their fields and they’ll be advising me on how to find new and different ways to get their industries back up and running. They include:Alex Scott, a former Lioness and Olympian, and now an award winning broadcaster. She will help us think through how we can get sport back safely in a way that works for clubs, players and supporters alike.Similarly Lord Grade, a former Chairman of both the BBC and ITV, will provide an insight into how we can get our creative and media industries back up and flourishing again.Tamara Rojo, the English National Ballet’s Artistic Director, will give us ideas for how we start to get our arts scene back up and running.And Martha Lane Fox, well-known as the founder of lastminute.com, will advise on how tech can power the recovery of all these sectors, but particularly in tourism, as part of the much wider role it will play in driving our economy forward, as it has done already.Meanwhile, bit by bit, we are developing guidance that is helping some of the lighter bits of our economy return to a new normal.So we have supported the safe return of TV production, meaning our broadcasters are able to keep some of our favourite shows on the TV screens, whether that’s Corry or Eastenders.We’ve helped to reopen the country’s tennis and basketball courts, and guided elite athletes back into training safely - and that in turn will pave the way for the return of live sports behind closed doors in the near future.Normal life as we have known it is still a long way off, and the path to get there is a narrow one.But these things will return, when it is safe for them to do so, thanks to the same drive and creativity that makes a great performance or a great piece of art.And I really think that when they do, and when we have overcome this crisis together, we will appreciate them that much more."
Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 18 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/environment-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-19-may-2020,Foreign Secretary,2020-05-18,"Coronavirus press conference (19 May 2020)Good afternoon and welcome to today’s briefing where I’m joined by Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientific advisor.I want to begin by updating you on the latest data relating to the coronavirus outbreak.2,772,552 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 89,784 tests carried out yesterday  248,818 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,412 cases since yesterday  10,025 people are currently in hospital with the coronavirus in the UK, that’s down 17% from the 11,716 this time last week  And sadly, of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 35,341 have now died. That’s an increase of 545 fatalities since yesterdayAnd of course our thoughts are with the families of all of those who have lost their lives to this virus.Before I turn to some of the work that Defra is doing to ensure that we are able to harvest this year’s farm harvest I want to remind people of the details of the next phase of our fight against the coronavirus.Firstly on slide one, as you can see, in order to monitor our progress we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System, with five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus.The alert level will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.And in turn that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place.The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures.Throughout the period of lockdown, which started on March 23rd, we were at Level 4.Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in careful steps.Turning now to slide two, We have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life - but crucially do this while avoiding what would be a second peak that overwhelms the NHS.After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R value and the number of infections, and all the available data, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.So in step one, as the Prime Minister announced last week:*Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going to work.*People can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as they like.Finally, turning to slide three, having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, our clear advice is to stay alert, control the virus, and save lives.And staying alert means:Staying at home as much as possible and working from home if this is possible  Limiting contact with other people and where contact is made with other people, keeping your distance  Washing your hands regularly and also staying at home and self-isolating if you or a household member show symptoms of the virusMy final point today relates to the availability of labour this year for the farming harvest. Every year large numbers of people come from countries such as Romania and Bulgaria to take part in the harvest, harvesting crops such as strawberries, and salads and vegetables.We estimate that probably only about a third of the people that would normally come are already here and small numbers may continue to travel. But one thing is clear and that is that this year we will need to rely on British workers to lend a hand to help bring that harvest home.Over the last couple of months we have been working with industry on a plan to support and help people taking second jobs, particularly those who are furloughed, and we have launched a new ‘Pick for Britain’ website that enables people to go online, check (what job issues there are) what job availability there is and to marry up job opportunities from growers and employers with those people seeking a second job, particularly those that are furloughed.We believe that those who are furloughed may be getting to the point that they want to lend a hand and play their part. They may be wanting to get out and they may be wanting to supplement their income with an additional job and if they do feel that way I would urge them to visit that website and to look at the opportunities that are there.I will now turn to Angela McLean who will give you further updates on the coronavirus."
Business Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 17 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-18-may-2020,Business Secretary,2020-05-17,"Watch the Foreign Secretary’ press briefing.Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference. I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, our Deputy CMO.I’ll start with the daily update on the latest data on coronavirus:2,682,716 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK. That includes 100,678 tests carried out yesterday  246,406 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,684 cases since yesterday  9,408 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down 13% from this time last week  and I’m very sad to report, of those who have tested positive for covid-19, across all settings, 34,796 have now died. That’s an increase of 160 deaths on yesterdayIt goes without saying that we offer our condolences to the friends and family of every individual who has passed away during this coronavirus pandemic.It is a challenging time and as we chart the right course over the weeks and months ahead, our overriding priority remains to save lives, whilst also preserving livelihoods and allowing people to return, over time and as and when it’s safe, to something resembling a more normal way of living.On 11 May, we set out a road map to provide the information, the advice and the reassurance to businesses, public services, to other organisations, to employees and to citizens up and down the country.And I want to thank everyone who is making the adjustments and engaging with us in government to forge the path ahead in a sure-footed and sustainable way.We recognise people will have concerns and questions, and we want to work together with them, and with everyone involved to provide the necessary confidence and reassurance in the next steps that we are poised to make.That approach is summarised in the slides which we have up on the screen.You’ll see from Slide 1, and as people will be aware, we have established a new COVID Alert System, with 5 levels, each relating to the current level of threat posed by the virus.The alert level is focused on the rate of infection, known as the R value, as well as the total number of coronavirus cases overall.The alert level helps us determine the social distancing measures that we need to fight the virus. So the lower the level, the fewer or the less restrictive the measures we will need at any given time.Since the lockdown began, at the end of March, we have been at Level 4 as indicated on the slide.Thanks to the hard work and the huge sacrifices across the UK, and the progress that we’ve made as a result of that, particularly in relation to compliance with the social distancing measures, we are in the process of moving from Level 4 to Level 3 on the slide. We will do that through a number of very careful and deliberate steps.Last week, the Prime Minister set out the first of 3 steps, designed to carefully modify the measures that had been put in place.By gradually easing certain measures, we can begin to allow people to return to something resembling a more normal way of life.The choices we make, what we are asking the British public to do, and what we’re asking them not to do, are designed to avoid the very real risk of a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS and of course risk turning a temporary economic painful moment for the country into permanent damage to the UK economy.At every step, we’ll closely monitor the impact of easing restrictions, and in particular the impact on the spread of the virus.It’s only by collecting and monitoring the data will we be able to take the next step, which is indicated as Step 2 on the slides, and that will be no earlier than 1 June.I understand it’s natural for people to question why they can’t do one or other thing right now, or why certain distinctions have been made, but in reality you have to look at the package of measures as a whole, mindful of the risk to the R level and taking into account the various economic and social effects combined.We’ve adopted a balanced approach, guided at all times by the science, and the overriding need to avoid a second peak that could overwhelm the NHS.It’s true to say making any changes inherently comes with some risk of spreading the virus compared to simply staying at home. But it’s also true that staying in permanent lockdown is itself not sustainable on health grounds or economic grounds.That’s why we have only eased measures where it can be done with the lowest risk possible. And that’s also why we are watching the impact of every change that we make very closely.I know the last couple of months have been really tough for families, for businesses, for everyone up and down the UK. But it is only by keeping to the plan, sticking to the rules, even including when those rules change, that we will beat coronavirus for good.That is why we have asked people to Stay Alert, to Control the Virus to Save Lives as we make changes to the measures in place in England and adjust the government’s advice accordingly.For the vast majority of people, that still means staying at home as much as possible. For those that can’t work from home, they should return to work with the arrangements in place to ensure it can be safely and responsibly done.We’ve also adjusted the advice to allow people to exercise more, to visit public outdoor spaces but staying 2 metres apart from those outside their own household.As ever, people need to keep washing their hands regularly and carrying out the hygiene measures that we’ve advertised before.Our advice is to wear a face covering when you are outside the home in enclosed spaces and where it’s difficult to socially distance, for example if going to the shops or travelling on public transport.And if you or anyone in your household develops symptoms, then you still all need to self-isolate.Now while we’re asking the public to do these things, we in government will keep ramping up the effort that we need to see to get the UK back to a more normal way of living.With that in mind, today, the Health Secretary announced that anyone in the UK with COVID-19 symptoms can now get a test by booking online, and I can also report that we’ve now recruited over 21,000 contact tracers and call handlers in England for the implementation of our test and trace programme. That programme is absolutely key in the next steps we need to take as a country to come through this pandemic safely and responsibly.

Education Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 May,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-17-may-2020,Education Secretary,2020-05-16,"Coronavirus press conference 17 May 2020Good afternoon.I am joined today by Professor Steve Powis who is National Medical Director of NHS England.I will shortly be setting out our progress on vaccines but first, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.2,580,769 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 91,206 tests carried out yesterday.243,303 people have tested positive. That’s an increase of 3,142 cases since yesterday.Unfortunately, due to technical issues, Northern Ireland have been unable to process any testing data for Pillar 1 today. Today’s daily totals therefore reflect Pillar 1 data for Great Britain only, excluding Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland are looking to resolve this issue as soon as possible and we will update the data when we can.10,035 people are in hospital with COVID-19, down (15%) from 11,817 this time last week.And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 34,636 have now died. That’s an increase of 170 fatalities since yesterday.Our thoughts are very much with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.Before talking about the work on vaccines and taking questions, I just want to remind everyone of the details of the next phase of our fight against coronavirus.First, in order to monitor our progress, we have established a new COVID Alert Level System, with 5 levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus.The alert level is based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.And in turn, that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place.The lower the level, the fewer the measures.The higher the level, the stricter the measures.Throughout the period of lockdown, which started on March 23, we have been at Level 4.Thanks to you, people across the country, we have collectively helped to bring the R level down.And we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in careful steps.We have set out the first of 3 steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life.But crucially, whilst avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS.After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data.And we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.As the Prime Minister announced this week, as part of the first step:    those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work        you can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like        you can meet 1 person outside of your household in an outdoor public place, provided you stay 2 metres apart  Having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated what we are asking people to do.Which is to: Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives.Staying Alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible.But there are a range of other actions we are advising people to take.People should Stay Alert, by:    working from home if you can        limiting contact with other people        keeping distance if you go out - 2 metres apart where possible        washing your hands regularly        wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant, for example in some shops and on public transport        and, if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate  Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections.This is how we can continue to save lives as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.But in order to definitively conquer this disease, we need to find a safe, workable vaccine.Last month I announced a new Vaccine Taskforce to coordinate the efforts of government, academia and industry in the critical mission to find a vaccine.I am very proud of how quickly our scientists and researchers have come together in their efforts to develop a vaccine that will combat coronavirus.Their work has meant that 2 of the world’s front-runners to develop a vaccine are right here in the UK – at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.The first clinical trial of the Oxford vaccine is progressing well, with all Phase 1 participants having received their vaccine dose on schedule earlier this week.They are now being monitored closely by the clinical trial team.The speed at which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented.Imperial College are also making good progress, and will be looking to move into clinical trials by mid-June, with larger scale trials planned to begin in October.So far the government has invested £47 million in the Oxford and Imperial vaccine programmes.But today I can announce an additional £84 million of new government funding to help accelerate their work.This new money will help mass produce the Oxford vaccine, so that if current clinical trials are successful, we have dosages to start vaccinating the UK population straight away.The funding will also allow Imperial to launch phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine later this year.I can also confirm that with government support, Oxford University has finalised a global licensing agreement with AstraZeneca for the commercialisation and manufacturing of the Oxford vaccine.This means that, if the vaccine is successful, Astra Zeneca will work to make up to 30 million doses available by September for the UK, as part of an agreement to deliver 100 million doses in total.The UK will be the first to get access.And we can also ensure that, in addition to supporting people here in the UK, we are able to make the vaccine available to developing countries at the lowest possible cost.To further support our domestic manufacturing capability, last month I announced that the government will accelerate building the UK’s first Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre, which is based at Harwell in Oxfordshire.And today I can announce that we will invest up to a further £93 million in the Centre, ensuring that it opens in summer 2021 - a full 12 months ahead of schedule.The Centre – which is already under construction - will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as 6 months.But if, and it is a big “if”, a successful vaccine is available later this year, we will need to be in a position to manufacture it at scale – and quickly.So while the Centre is being built, the government will establish a rapid deployment facility thanks to a further investment of £38 million to begin coronavirus vaccine manufacturing at scale from this summer.This facility will support efforts to ensure a vaccine is widely available to the UK public as soon as possible.In total, the government has now committed over a quarter of a billion pounds towards developing a vaccine in the UK.But there are no certainties.In spite of the tireless effort of our scientists, it is possible that we may never find a successful coronavirus vaccine.So we also need to look at other drug treatments and therapeutics for those who get the virus.Treatments that could prevent people progressing to severe illness, or help save lives of those with serious symptoms.While there are currently no drugs in the world have been clinically proven to treat coronavirus, the government is working with our scientists and medical experts to identify promising candidates.This collaborative UK programme, known as the ACCORD (Accelerating COVID-19 Research & Development platform), aims to get an early indication of drug treatments’ effectiveness in treating coronavirus.And today I can report that 6 drugs have now entered initial live clinical trials.If positive results are seen, they will advance into larger scale trials.Our scientists are working tirelessly to develop vaccines and drug treatments.Condensing work which would usually take years, into months and even weeks.Their drive and dedication inspires us all.And with their help, we will overcome coronavirus.Thank you."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/education-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-may,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-05-15,"Coronavirus press conference 16 May 2020Welcome to today’s briefing from Downing Street. I am joined by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer.First, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.2,489,563 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 136,486 tests carried out yesterday;240,161 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,451 cases since yesterday;10,484 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down 12% from 11,872 this time last week.And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 34,466 have now died. That’s an increase of 468 fatalities since yesterday. This figure is in all settings not just hospitals.Before we begin questions from the public and from the media I want to remind people of the details of the next phase of our fight against coronavirus.First, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System, with five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus.The alert level will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.And in turn that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place.The lower the level, the fewer the measures; the higher the level, the stricter the measures.Throughout the period of lockdown which started on 23 March we have been at Level 4.Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the level of infection down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in very careful steps.We have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life - but crucially avoiding what would be a second peak that overwhelms the NHS.After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.Step 1, from this week, means those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work. You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like. You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided you stay two metres apart.Having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated what we are asking people to do, which is to Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives.If everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by ensuring the R number does not go above one and reducing the number of infections. This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.At this time of year GCSE and A level students would have been making final preparations for their exams, while others were enjoying their summer term.If you are one of them, can I say how sorry I am that this has happened to you this year.The sacrifices that you and all young people have made have been especially tough.It is now almost eight weeks since we asked schools, nurseries and colleges to close to all but a small number of children.Once again I would like to say an enormous thank you to all the school, college and childcare staff who have been going above and beyond the call of duty to care for smaller groups of children of critical workers, vulnerable children as well as making sure there are resources available at home for children to learn, interacting with them and making sure that children know you are there for them. You have been simply outstanding and we’re so grateful for what you have done.We have been quite clear all along, that we would only start inviting more children back into schools when our five key tests had been met. That position has not changed and it is what is guiding our actions.But we do want to see all children back in school because we know how much children grow and benefit from being in school.We can now start the planning for a very limited return to schools for some pupils potentially as early as next month.Let me explain how this will work because I know that some people, including parents and teachers, are very anxious about this.If the rates of infection are decreasing, it will give us a green light to get children back into childcare and more of them back into school from 1 June.As part of a cautious phased return, those in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 will be allowed back into school in smaller class sizes. We are also planning to get some secondary school students back – those in years 10 and 12 – to make sure they have the opportunity to come back to school on a limited basis and have some face to face time with teachers.We are prioritising these children because they stand to lose more by staying away from school. The first years of school are pivotal for children to develop social and behavioural skills and to learn the basics that are going to have a huge bearing on how well they do in their life. Students in Years 10 and 12 need support in the run up to vital exams next year and it’s vital that we do all we can to help them succeed and help them do well.This is particularly important for vulnerable and disadvantaged young people.There are some who would like to delay the wider opening of schools. But there is a consequence to this. The longer that schools are closed, the more children miss out. Teachers know this. Teachers know that there are children out there who have not spoken to or played with another child of their own age for the last two months.They know there are children from difficult or very unhappy homes for whom school is their happiest place in their week. It’s also the safest place for them to be and it’s thanks to their teachers and the support that their teachers give to them that they are safe and happy.The poorest children, the most disadvantaged children, the children who do not always have support they need at home, will be the ones who will fall furthest behind if we keep school gates closed. They are the ones who will miss out on the opportunities and chances in life that we want all children to benefit from what teachers and schools deliver for them.So we’re asking some children to come back from the 1 June. And we are asking schools to adopt a number of strict protective measures.This includes reducing class sizes, and making sure pupils stay within these small groups, creating a protective and small bubble around them.Schools will also be rigorous about hygiene, cleaning and hand washing. School staff can already be tested for the virus but from 1 June we will extend that to cover children and their families if any of them develop symptoms. Track-and-trace methods will then be used to prevent the virus from spreading.Together, these measures will create an inherently safer system, where the risk of transmission is substantially reduced – for children, their teachers and also their families.My department has been issuing full and detailed guidance on how to implement these measures and prepare for wider opening. We have worked closely with the sector, listening to those who work in the classroom. We will continue to do so, to ensure schools have the support they need.It goes without saying that we will be carefully monitoring the impact this first phase has and we will use this to guide us when we consider our next steps.This phased return is in line with what other European countries are doing to get their own schools, colleges and nurseries back.I know a lot of you may be worried about sending your children to school. Every one of us wants the very best for our children and I know how stressful this time has been for many families. I want to reassure you that this approach is based on the best scientific advice, with children at the very heart of everything we do.Education is one of the most important gifts we can give any children.So when we are advised that we can start to bring some children back to school we should do so, so that they don’t miss out on the enormous opportunities to learn, to be with their friends and to benefit from everything that their teachers and schools can offer them. We owe it to the children in order to be able to do that.I would like now to hand over to Jenny and then we will take some questions."
Transport Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 14 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-15-may-2020,Transport Secretary,2020-05-14,"Coronavirus press conference (15 May 2020)Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.I’m joined by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries, and by NHS England’s Medical Director for Primary Care, Dr Nikki Kanani.I want to take this chance to update you on the latest coronavirus data. 2,353,078 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 133,784 tests yesterday. 236,711 people have tested positive for the virus, an increase of 3,560 since yesterday. 10,024 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus. This is a 13% fall from the same time last week.And very sadly, of those who tested positive, across all settings, 33,998 people have now died. That’s an increase of 384 since yesterday. And we mourn each one. The number of deaths is falling each day, in all settings thankfully, and we are past the peak of this virus.I want to take a moment to remind everyone about our plans for this second phase. We have set up the new COVID Alert Level System. That’s the five levels of threat – based on the R value and the number of new cases. The alert level in turn guides the social distancing rules, which are vital in our efforts to control the virus.A higher alert level means stricter rules. Throughout the lockdown, we have been at level 4 which means that Covid-19 is in general circulation and transmission is high or rising exponentially.But, thanks to your shared sacrifice, we’ve brought R down. Cautiously, carefully and responsibly, we are now in a position to start moving to level 3.We’ve set out the first of the 3 steps that we’ll take to carefully modify the social distancing rules and start to restore freedom to this country, all the while avoiding a disastrous second peak that could overwhelm the NHS.At each step, we will closely monitor the impact on R, on the number of new infections and on, of course, all available data. And we’ll only move to the next step when we judge it is safe to do so.In the first step, as of this week, if you work but can’t work from home, you should speak to your employer about going back in. People can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like and you can meet 1 other person from outside your household in an outdoor, public place. But please keep 2 metres apart.This weekend, with the good weather and the new rules, I hope people can enjoy being outside but please stick with the rules, keep an eye on your family and don’t take risks.We’ve also updated what we’re asking people to do, which is to stay alert, control the virus and save lives.For the vast majority of people, staying alert still means staying at home as much as is possible. Working from home when you can, limiting contact with people, keeping your distance if you go out, 2 metres wherever possible, washing your hands regularly. This is still the single most effective thing that you can do to keep yourself safe and, of course, self-isolating if you or anyone in your household has coronavirus symptoms.By staying alert and following the rules, you can play a part in the national effort getting the R down and keeping R down, controlling the virus so that we can save lives, rebuild livelihoods and start to recover our freedom."
Housing Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 13 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/transport-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-14-may-2020,Housing Secretary,2020-05-13,"Transport Secretary’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19) 14 May 2020Opening remarksGood afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam.Latest dataLet me start by updating you on the latest information from the Government’s COBR data file.Through our monitoring and testing programme, as of today:2,219,281 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including a new record of 126,064 tests carried out yesterday  233,151 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,446 cases since yesterday  11,041 people are in hospital with COVID-19, down 14% from a week ago, when 12,802 patients were hospitalised  and sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, 33,614 have now died - that’s an increase of 428 fatalities since yesterday.This new figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.Our deepest sympathies go out to the families and friends as the nation battles to defeat the disease.Main contentToday I’m going to set out how – whilst the country has been at a virtual standstill – this downtime has been used to fix and upgrade the nation’s road and rail infrastructure, along with plans to help our economy bounce back.But before I set out today’s transport announcements, let me briefly remind you of the government’s roadmap out of this crisis.As you know, we have established a new COVID Alert System, with five levels - based primarily on the R value and the number of cases.Throughout the lockdown, we have been at Level 4.Thanks to the British people, we have brought the R down and we can now begin moving carefully to Level 3.From this week we’re at Step 1, meaning that:those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work  you can now spend time outdoors and exercise as much as you like  you can meet one person who’s not part of your household outside, provided you stay 2 metres apartStep 2 - from June 1, at the earliest, as long as it’s safe, we aim to allow:primary schools to reopen for some pupils, in smaller class sizes  non-essential retail to start to reopen  cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed doors, without crowdsAnd then Step 3 – no earlier than July 4, and again, only if the data says it’s safe, we aim to allow:more businesses to open, including those offering personal care, those in the leisure sector, together with places of worshipWe can control this virus if we stay alert.But what does staying alert actually mean?Staying alert, for the vast majority of people still means staying at home as much as possible, and working from home if you can.But it also means:limiting contact with other people  keeping your distance if you go out  washing your hands regularly  wearing a face covering in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant - for example on public transport  and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolateIf everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections.This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.Transport contextToday I want to update you on the measures we’re taking to speed up our economic recovery while keeping people safe.For 2 months, we’ve remained in lockdown, travelling as little as possible, and in doing so, the whole country has protected the NHS and helped reduce the number of COVID infections.But as we begin making tentative steps towards restarting our economy and people in some sectors who can’t work from home begin to return to their workplaces, it is clear that transport has a critical role to play.Last Saturday, I explained why it’s our civic duty to avoid public transport, if at all possible.Because, even when we have 100% of services up and running, there may only be socially-distanced space available for 1 in 10 passengers.Therefore, in order to help reduce crowding, we set out a £2 billion programme to put cycling and walking at the heart of transport, with £250 million emergency spending already underway.Over the past week, we have followed this up by publishing 3 pieces of detailed guidance.First, for local authorities in England, explaining how they should prepare for significantly-increased numbers of cyclists and pedestrians.Next, for the transport sector, to ensure they provide safer services for those travelling, and safer workplaces for their staff.And third, and most importantly, for passengers.We’re asking the public to help ensure that the transport system does not become significantly overwhelmed by returning commuters.The guidance makes clear, that if you can’t walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it, rather than travelling by bus, train or tram…..Especially where that public transport is liable to be overcrowded.And, for those people who absolutely need to use public transport…It also explains how you can best protect yourself and those around you.Transport upgrades during lockdownIn the coming weeks, as we carefully and cautiously restart sectors of our economy, and people begin to travel once again…They should notice that, whilst the country has been in down-time……with the roads and railways quiet…We’ve been busy…Getting on with essential work….Fixing the nation’s infrastructure…So we can recover faster when the time comes.This upgrade programme……the kind of work that – at any other time –  would cause inevitable disruption and service delays, whilst costing the taxpayer more……has instead been carried out in previously unimaginable circumstances of a largely unused transport network.For example, we completed 419 separate Network Rail projects over Easter, with a further 1,000 upgrades being carried out throughout the May bank holidays.Meanwhile, Highways England has been busy accelerating maintenance projects on the nation’s roads.Last week, for example, we opened the vital A14 upgrade 7 months ahead of schedule.This is a route normally used by 85,000 drivers daily, which will dramatically improve access to the UK’s largest container port at Felixstowe and permanently boost the distribution of goods around the UK.As Northern Powerhouse minister – I can report that – in the North, we’ve delivered £96 million of rail infrastructure improvements during April.And throughout the country, we’ve accelerated maintenance projects on road and rail…Whilst always sticking to PHE safety guidelines…..So that altogether, Highways England has delivered over £200 million of upgrades, and Network Rail £550 million worth, during April alone.I’d like to thank the army of transport and construction workers who have been grafting very hard throughout the lockdown.Building future infrastructureBut to make sure that Britain is ready to bounce-back from coronavirus…Today I can announce nearly £2 billion to upgrade our roads and railways, to put our transport infrastructure in the best possible shape and to get our economy growing once again.This package includes £1.7 billion for local roads – making journeys smoother and safer for drivers, hauliers, cyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians and others…By filling millions of dangerous potholes, we will make our roads safer – and encourage more people to cycle, or even take part in the upcoming e-scooter trials…Helping more people play a part in relieving pressure on public transport.This investment will also help fix damage caused by winter flooding, repair roads and bridges, and fund numerous road improvement schemes.As more people become mobile again, we’ll be building a network of rapid charging stations for electric cars…Including a big expansion of rapid-charging facilities at motorway service stations…Helping the country to lock-in the dramatic air-quality improvements we’ve experienced during the coronavirus lockdown.A better futureAmid all the sad news and tragedy of loved ones we’ve lost, we’ve somehow managed to do things in weeks that would normally take years…Building new hospitals…Moving public services online…Making instant reforms and fast-tracking new laws…Extraordinary changes in the way that employers and employees work…Effectively taking large swathes of the economy online almost overnight…Now we want to keep this momentum going.If building a new hospital takes 2 weeks, why should building a new road still take as long as 20 years?If GP surgeries can quickly move online, why are most rail passengers still travelling on cardboard tickets?We must exploit our newfound capacity to respond at pace and apply it to rapidly improving our infrastructure.And we must examine why it is that bureaucratic bindweed makes British infrastructure some of the costliest and slowest in Europe to build.Because whilst many will continue to work from home even after this immediate crisis……both the long-term transport trend and the pressing need to level-up communities across the country, dictate that infrastructure will be even more important in stimulating our recovery and supporting new jobs.So by combining fast home-internet access, with vastly upgraded transport connections, we can help revive many of our small and medium-sized towns which over decades have been left behind.Closing remarksThis has been a devastating start to the year, not just for Britain, but for the world.And we are only at Phase 1 of the recovery plan.But we all know that it is our reaction to adversity that will ultimately define how we recover.We must harness our approach to tackling the pandemic….And apply it to rebuilding our own infrastructure.With the same swift action, innovation, and collective determination that has characterised the past few months…..And in doing so, we can emerge stronger."
Business Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 12 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/housing-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-13-may-2020,Business Secretary,2020-05-12,"videoGood afternoon,As Housing Secretary, I’m going to set out our comprehensive plan to safely restart, reopen and renew the housing market.But first, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.    2,094,209 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 87,063 tests carried out yesterday        229,705 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,242 cases since yesterday        11,327 people are in hospital with COVID-19, down 15% from 13,273 last week        And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 33,186 have now died. That’s an increase of  494 fatalities since yesterday  These figures includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.Before turning to the housing market I want to remind people of how we will address this phase of our fight against COVID-19.Firstly, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System, with 5 levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus.The alert level will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.And in turn that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place.The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures.The social distancing measures remain critical in our efforts to control the virus.Throughout the period of lockdown which started on 23 March we have been at Level 4 – meaning a COVID-19 epidemic is in general circulation, and transmission is high or rising exponentially.Thanks to the hard work and the sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down, now that we are in a position to begin moving to Level 3, we will do so in time, in careful steps.We have set out the first of 3 steps we will take to carefully modify the measures and gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life – but crucially doing so while avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak that could overwhelms the NHS.After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data will be used, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is completely safe to do so.The first step – from this week:Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work.  You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like.  You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided you stay 2 metres apart.The second step – from 1 June , at the earliest, as long as the data allows, we will aim to do the following:Primary schools to reopen for some pupils, in smaller class sizes.  Non-essential retail to start to reopen, when and where it is safe to do so.  Cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed doors, without crowds.And then step 3 – no earlier than 4 July, and again, only if the data says it safe to do so, we aim to allow:More businesses and premises to open, including potentially those offering personal care such as leisure facilities, public places, and places of worship.And on that last point, I have been speaking to faith leaders and will convene later this week a taskforce to establish when and how places of worship can openly safely for some of the practices where social distancing can take place, such as private prayer, potentially private prayer being able to be carried out earlier than 4 July.Many of these businesses and organisations will need to operate in new ways to ensure they are safe, and we will work with those sectors and individuals on how to do this.Having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated what we are asking people to do, which is to Stay Alert, to Control the Virus and Save Lives.For many people the appropriate course still means staying at home as much as possible.But there are a range of other actions we’re advising people to take when they do go out to work or for other activities:    limiting contact with other people        keeping distance if you go out – 2 metres apart where possible        washing your hands regularly        wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant – for example in some shops or on public transport        and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate  If everyone stays alert and follows these rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections.This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.And as we begin to recover from coronavirus, it’s essential that we cautiously open essential parts of our economy, where it is safe to do so.Earlier today in Parliament, I made a statement setting out our clear, coherent and comprehensive plan to restart, reopen and renew the housing market and our construction industry.I’m sure that this will be of interest to many people at home who are hoping to move house, and I’d like to set out what this means in more detail.From today anyone in England can move house if they follow new guidance we have published on GOV.UK.When the lockdown was announced in March, we changed the rules so that people could only move home if they thought it was “reasonably necessary”.That meant that more than 450,000 buyers had to put their plans on hold.And each month 300,000 tenancies come up for renewal as well.A significant proportion of these will result in people needing to or wanting to move home. The pressure to move for some was becoming acute, with serious legal, financial and health implications.During an already very difficult time, these people have been stuck in limbo. Now they can carry on with their house moves and add some certainty to their lives.So, from today:    estate agents’ offices can re-open        viewings – whether virtual or in person – are permitted        show homes can open        and removal companies and the other essential parts of the sales and letting process are re-started with immediate effect  For most people moving home is not a luxury. People decide to move home because their personal circumstances change.The changes that I have announced today are happening safely in order to control the virus and to protect the public.We have published very detailed guidance, informed by public health advice, to explain how this can be achieved, with all parties observing hygiene measures and social distancing guidelines.People have asked why they would be able to look around a stranger’s house, but not visit their parents or loved ones at home.Now I understand why that might seem confusing at first glance – especially when people have been separated from their loved ones for so long.But our guidelines makes clear that in the first instance that viewings should happen virtually. When viewings do happen in person, we’ve set out a clear plan to ensure the safety of those already in the property itself, those considering moving in and the estate agents and lettings agents.These requirements include:    Visits being by appointment only, open house viewings not taking place, and speculative viewings where buyers or tenants are not serious yet, are highly discouraged.        All parties following strict social distancing guidelines.        All internal doors should be opened where possible.        The current occupier vacating the property for the duration of the visit, going out for their daily exercise, going out to the shops or standing in the garden, if that is possible.        All involved in the process washing their hands upon entering the property. And, once the viewing has taken place, all surfaces in the property including the door handles, should be thoroughly cleaned.  There are of course exceptions. For those who are self-isolating or have coronavirus, they should not be moving or going back to work or allowing trades people or professionals into their home.Where this is the case, all parties involved in house buying or selling should prioritise agreeing amicable sensible arrangements to change move dates for the individuals concerned. That has been happening across the country in recent weeks and it will need to continue.We would also ask those who are clinically vulnerable and those who are shielding to consider very carefully their personal situation and to seek personal and specific medical advice before deciding whether to commit to or proceed with moving home.If you are in this situation, and you decide that you must go ahead, all professionals involved must be made aware so that they can put in place any additional precautionary measures to provide further protection for your health and further legal protection to make sure the transaction goes as smoothly as can be expected.A vibrant housing market means more than buying and selling homes. We need to get back to building again and Britain needs that.It is something that this government has always been committed to. Something that our ambitious First Homes programme will do later this year, with a 30% discount on new homes for key workers including nurses and teachers and police officers as well as local first time buyers.We want them to be ready as soon as possible and that’s just one of the reasons I am keen to get construction up and running.To help with this today I am announcing further steps to support safe house building by allowing more flexible working hours on construction sites, where it’s appropriate and with local consent.I am allowing sites to apply to extend their working hours, again with immediate effect, to 9pm Monday to Saturday in residential areas and beyond that in non-residential areas, and setting out a very clear government position that these applications should be approved by local councils unless there are very compelling reasons why this is not appropriate.Varied start and finish times will make it easier for sites to observe social distancing, take the pressure off public transport like the tube in London, and keep Britain building.There are countless examples of the industry behaving responsibly and proactively during this pandemic.I’d like to thank today Taylor Wimpey, who now have now got construction safely underway on the majority of their sites and have started removing staff from the furlough scheme and getting back to work on full pay.They are offering a discount of 5% for NHS staff and care workers on new homes – a great way to recognise the contribution that our front line heroes are making to the country.So thank you to them.It’s also time that the planning system makes more use of digital technology to operate remotely and efficiently during this pandemic.I am determined that the planning inspectorate be at the forefront of this work – I welcome the inspectorate now undertaking its first ever virtual hearings.I am asking them to make all hearings virtual within weeks so that the planning system can resume and be made more permanently more accessible and user-friendly.This is the most comprehensive restarting of an industry in the first phase of our roadmap with few if any transactions there is no visibility and no precedent with which to accurately judge the state of the housing market, but history tells us that in each economic recovery in modern British economic life the housing market has been key to recovery and revival.As Housing Secretary, I will do everything I can to support the millions of people employed in the construction and the housing industries, to help their sector bounce back, while always prioritising their safety and wellbeing.Almost 100 separate organisations have already signed up to the Charter for Safe Working Practice, pledging that they will share the responsibility to ensure that their sites operate safely and in accordance with government advice.I’d like to thank all of all of those who have signed and encourage the whole industry to join them.Today we reopen, we restart and renew the housing market and construction industry to protect lives, to save jobs and to begin rebuilding our economy.Thank you."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 11 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-12-may-2020,Prime Minister,2020-05-11,"Business Secretary Alok Sharma speaking at the daily coronavirus press conferenceGood afternoon. I am joined today by Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England and Sarah Albon who is the Chief Executive of the Health and Safety Executive.First, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.2,007,146 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 85,293 tests carried out yesterday.226,463 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,403 cases since yesterday.11,605 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, up from 11,465 the previous dayAnd sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 32,692 have now died. That’s an increase of 627 fatalities since yesterday.This is of course devastating news for families across the UK, and we all need to stay alert and control the virus.I just want to remind people of the details of the next phase of our fight against coronavirus that we set out this week.If we turn to the first slide, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System, with five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus. The alert level will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.And in turn that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place. The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures.The social distancing measures remain critical in our efforts to control the virus.Throughout the period of lockdown, which started on March 23 we have been at Level 4.Meaning, a COVID-19 epidemic is in general circulation, and transmission is high or rising exponentially.But thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, you have helped to bring the R level down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in careful steps.As you see on the next slide, we have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life - but crucially, while avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS. After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.Step 1. From this week:Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work.You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like.You can meet one person outside of your household outside provided you stay 2 metres apart.Step 2. From June 1, at the earliest, as long as the data allows, we aim to allow:Primary schools to reopen for some pupils, in smaller class sizes.Non-essential retail to start to reopen, when and where it is safe to do so,Cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed doors, without crowds.And then Step 3. No earlier than July 4, and again, only if the data says it is safe, we aim to allow:More businesses and premises to open, including potentially those offering personal care such as leisure facilities, public places, and places of worship.Many of these businesses will need to operate in new ways to ensure they are safe, and we will work with these sectors on how to do this.As you will see from slide 3, having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures, and our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated our messaging.We are now asking people to Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives.Yes - staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible.But there are a range of other actions we’re advising people to take.People should stay alert, by:Working from home if you can.Limiting contact with other people.Keeping distance if you go out - 2 metres apart where possible.Washing your hands regularly.Wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed space where it’s difficult to be socially distant - for example in some shops and on public transport.And if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate.As slide 4 shows, if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections.This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.And to underpin this in the workplace, we have published new ‘COVID-19 secure’ guidance on working safely, available to UK employers, across 8 work settings, which are allowed to be open and where their employees cannot work from home.This also includes guidance for shops which we believe may be in a position to begin a phased reopening at the earliest from the 1 June.Firms, unions, industry bodies and the devolved administrations have all fed into this guidance to give businesses and their employees the confidence they need to work safely.And I believe we have reached a consensus in doing that.We have also worked with Public Health England and the Health and Safety Executive, to develop best practice on the safest ways of working across the economy.The guidelines outline practical steps for employers to take, including carrying out a COVID-19 risk assessment, in consultation with employees or trades unions.A downloadable notice is included in the documents, which employers should display in their workplace to show their employees, customers and other visitors, that they have followed this guidance.We have also provided practical steps for employers to consider such as putting up barriers or screens in shared spaces, creating “fixed teams” or “partnering” to minimise the number of people in contact with one another, and frequent cleaning of work areas and equipment between uses to reduce transmission.To support employers and employees through this, the government has made available up to an extra £14 million for the Health and Safety Executive, equivalent to an increase of 10% of their budget.This is for extra call centre employees, inspectors and equipment, if needed.We know how important the Job Retention Scheme has been in helping businesses through this difficult time.And today the Chancellor has announced a four-month extension of the scheme to help provide certainty to businesses.To date, 7.5 million jobs have been furloughed, protecting livelihoods across the nation.Until the end of July, there will be no changes to the scheme.Then from August to October the scheme will continue, for all sectors and regions of the UK, but with greater flexibility to support the transition back to work.Employers currently using the scheme will be able to bring employees back part time.And, as the economy reopens, we will ask firms to start sharing, with government, the cost of paying people’s salaries.To be clear, the same level of support of 80% of people’s current salary, up to £2,500 will continue to be met, but through a shared effort between employers and government.We will be setting out more details on the changes before the end of the month.Throughout this pandemic, I have been struck by the way people have looked out for one another.These measures are produced in that spirit.So to employers I say: use this support and guidance to know you are doing the right thing and work with your unions and workers to keep each other safe.And to workers I say: we are looking out for you; we want you to feel confident that you are financially supported and returning to a safe workplace.Because in this time like no other, we all need to work together safely, as we rebuild our economy.Thank you."

I can report through the Government’s ongoing testing and monitoring programme that, as of today:1,921,770 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 100,490 tests carried out yesterday;  223,060 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,877 cases since yesterday;  11,401 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 11,768 the previous day.  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 32,065 have now died. That’s an increase of 210 fatalities since yesterday. This figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.Before we begin questions from the public and from the media I just want to remind people of a number of important things I said in my address to the nation last night.First, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System. The COVID Alert Level has five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus. The level will be primarily determined by the R value and the number of coronavirus cases. In turn, that COVID Alert Level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place. The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures.Throughout the period of lockdown which started on March 23rd we have been at Level 4 – meaning a Covid19 epidemic is in general circulation, and transmission is high or rising exponentially. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in steps.And we have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life - but crucially while avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS.After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.Step 1 - from this week:Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work.  You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like.  You can meet one person outside of your household outside (outdoors), provided you stay 2 metres apart. The social distancing measures remain absolutely crucial to us keeping the infection rate and the number of cases down as low as we possibly can.Step 2 - from June 1, at the earliest, as long as the data allows, we aim to allow:Primary schools to reopen for some pupils, in smaller class sizes;  Non-essential retail to start to reopen, when and where it is safe to do so;  Cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed doors, without crowds.And then Step 3 – no earlier than July 4, and again, only if the data says it safe, we aim to allow:More businesses and premises to open, including potentially those offering personal care such as leisure facilities, public places, and places of worship. Many of these businesses will need to operate in new ways to ensure they are safe, and we will work with these sectors on how to do this.So, given we have taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures today, and therefore our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated our messaging. We are now asking people to Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives.Yes - staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible. But there are a range of other actions we’re advising people to take as we modify measures.People should Stay Alert, by:working from home if you can;  limiting contact with other people;  keeping distance if you go out - 2 metres apart where possible;  washing your hands regularly;  wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant - for example in some shops and on public transport;  and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate.Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections. This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus."
Transport Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-10-may-2020,Transport Secretary,2020-05-09,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has addressed the nation on coronavirus.It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom – your freedom – of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war.And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly.You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing.Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it’s the only way to defeat the coronavirus - the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime.And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense.And though we grieve for all those we have lost.It is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst case scenario was half a million fatalities.And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down.And thanks to you we have protected our NHS and saved many thousands of lives.And so I know - you know - that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike.We must stay alert.We must continue to control the virus and save lives.And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life.We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants.And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing.To their futures and the futures of their children.So I want to provide tonight - for you - the shape of a plan to address both fears.Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society.A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed.I will be setting out more details in Parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening.I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK.And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates.And though it is right to be flexible in our response.I believe that as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, there is a strong resolve to defeat this together.And today a general consensus on what we could do.And I stress could.Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan.And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests.We must protect our NHS.We must see sustained falls in the death rate.We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection.We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people who need it, and yes, it is a global problem but we must fix it.And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases.And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures.The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.There will be five alert levels.Level One means the disease is no longer present in the UK and Level Five is the most critical – the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed.Over the period of the lockdown we have been in Level Four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three.And as we go everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down.By staying alert and following the rules.And to keep pushing the number of infections down there are two more things we must do.We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done.And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts.So that – all told - we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day.We have made fast progress on testing – but there is so much more to do now, and we can.When this began, we hadn’t seen this disease before, and we didn’t fully understand its effects.With every day we are getting more and more data.We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes.Because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups – in your area – as well as giving us a national picture.And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below one.And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given.We have by no means fulfilled all of them.And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week.Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures.And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week.We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must.We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible – because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited.So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can’t work from home.And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure.And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards.And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them.And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further.In step two – at the earliest by June 1 – after half term – we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6.Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity.We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health.And I must stress again that all of this is conditional, it all depends on a series of big Ifs.It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.And to prevent re-infection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission significantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air.And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective.And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes.We have been through the initial peak – but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous.We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need.But in the end this is a plan that everyone must make work.And when I look at what you have done already.The patience and common sense you have shown.The fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can.The incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS staff, our care workers.The devotion and self-sacrifice of all those in every walk of life who are helping us to beat this disease.Police, bus drivers, train drivers, pharmacists, supermarket workers, road hauliers, bin collectors, cleaners, security guards, postal workers, our teachers and a thousand more.The scientists who are working round the clock to find a vaccine.When I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country.And that have helped to get us through this first phase.I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next.And if we can’t do it by those dates, and if the alert level won’t allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right.We will come back from this devilish illness.We will come back to health, and robust health.And though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before.More resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and more sharing.But for now we must stay alert, control the virus and save lives.Thank you very much."
Environment Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 8 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/transport-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-9-may-2020,Environment Secretary,2020-05-08,"Transport Secretary’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19) 9 May 2020Opening remarksGood afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.I’m pleased to be joined today by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam.Latest dataLet me start by updating you on the latest information from the COBR data file.I can report that through the government’s monitoring and testing programme, as of today…..1, 728,443 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 96, 878 tests yesterday  215,260 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,896 cases since yesterday  11,809 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down from 12,284 yesterdayAnd tragically, of those hospitalised with the virus, 31,587 have now died. That’s an increase of 346 fatalities since yesterday.These deaths are devastating for the families and friends of victims, who are in our thoughts and prayers are with all of them every day.But they also strengthen our resolve to fight this pandemic with all the resources we can muster in the weeks ahead….Planning for restart/opportunity for lasting changeTomorrow, the Prime Minister will set out a roadmap for the next phase in our strategy to tackle coronavirus.In support of this, I am setting out today an ambitious programme to help prepare our transport network for the critical role it will play as we emerge from this crisis.Importantly, it is true to say that moving beyond COVID will be a gradual process… not a single-leap to freedom.When we do emerge, the world will seem quite different, at least for a while.The need to maintain social distancing means that our public transport system cannot go back to where it left off.Here is a very stark fact…Even with public transport reverting to full service - once you take into account the 2 metre social distancing rule – there would only be effective capacity for one in ten passengers on many parts of the network.Just a tenth of the old capacity.So, getting Britain moving again, while not overcrowding our transport network, is going to require many of us to think carefully about how and when we travel.Everyone involvedWe have accomplished so much over the past 7 weeks of lockdown.The whole country has been responsible for reducing the COVID reproduction or ‘R’ rate…Millions of households across the UK have changed their behaviour for the greater good.Getting Britain moving again, whilst not overcrowding our transport network, represents another enormous logistical challenge.Yet this is a problem which presents a health opportunity too…. an opportunity to make lasting changes that could not only make us fitter, but also better-off – both mentally and physically – in the long run.Active travelDuring the crisis, millions of people have discovered the benefits of active travel.By cycling or walking, we’ve been able to enjoy this remarkably warm spring whilst sticking to the guidelines.In some places, there’s been a 70% rise in the number of people on bikes whether it’s for exercise, or necessary journeys, such as stocking up on food.So, while it’s still crucial that we stay at home,  when the country does get back to work, we need those people to carry on cycling and walking, and to be joined by many more.Otherwise, with public transport capacity severely restricted, more cars could be drawn to the road and our towns and cities could become gridlocked.We also know that in this new world, pedestrians will need more space.So today (9 May 2020) I am announcing a £2 billion package to put cycling and walking at the heart of our transport policy.To set out how we will deliver this, I will bring forward a national cycling plan for publication in early June, in line with the statutory Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy to help double cycling and increase walking by 2025.The first stage, worth £250 million, is a series of swift, emergency interventions to make cycling and walking safer.Pop-up bike lanes. Wider pavements. Cycle and bus-only streets. All examples of what people will start to see more of.Accompanying the new money, we are today publishing fast-tracked statutory guidance, effective immediately, requiring councils in England to cater for significantly-increased numbers of cyclists and pedestrians, and making it easier for them to create safer streets.For employees who want to start cycling to their place of work, but who don’t have a bike right now, the popular Cycle to Work Scheme already allows employees to save between 25% and 39% on the cost of a new bike or an electric bike.There has been a huge increase in people using the scheme,  and we will work with employers to increase uptake further.And for those who may have an old bike in the shed, and want to get it back into a roadworthy condition, there will be a voucher scheme for bike repairs and maintenance.Plans are also being developed to boost bike fixing facilities.What’s more, over the next few months, we will set out further measures to make a ‘once in a generation’ change to the way people travel in Britain.These will include tough new standards for cycling infrastructure;a new national cycling champion to inspire us  much closer links with the NHS, with GPs prescribing cycling to help us get fitter  legal changes to protect vulnerable road users  at least one “zero-emission city,” with its centre restricted to bikes and electric vehicles  and the creation of a long-term cycling programme and budget, just like we have for our roadsThere’s clear evidence, including from the Prime Minister’s time as mayor of London, that making streets safe for walking and cycling is good for retailers, business and the economy.Green travel / E-scooters / E-vehiclesAnd in making these changes, our national recovery can also become a green recovery.One of the few positive benefits about the crisis is drastically better air quality and the health benefits that that brings.More than 20,000 extra deaths a year in the UK are attributed to nitrogen dioxide emissions, which are highest in areas with most road traffic.We want to try to preserve this as much as possible.So today I’m also fast-tracking trials of e-scooters, bringing this programme, already underway, forward from next year, to next month….And extending those trials from four local authorities to every region in the country that wants them….… in a bid to get e-scooter rental schemes up-and-running in our cities as fast as possible….Helping reduce car use on shorter journeys, and taking some pressure off buses, at this vital time.These trials will help us assess their safety and benefits, together with their impact on public spaces.The car industry has of course been very badly hit during this crisis, but April’s new sales figures showed – for the first time – that the two biggest selling models were both electric vehicles.So, to help keep this quiet, clean car revolution going, I can also announce today, £10 million of additional support for car-charging points on our streets.The car will remain the mainstay for many families and, as well as backing electric infrastructure, we’re going to accelerate the filling of pot-holes that plague so many road users.DataAnd just as new technology is changing the vehicles we use, so new digital technologies will help us make more informed transport choices in our battle against Covid.At a time when transport demand could quickly overwhelm capacity if users have no access to real-time travel information…… It is crucial that we take advantage of the UK’s digital tech expertise.With the right mobile apps, people can find out which parts of the transport network are overcrowded. And avoid them!They can choose alternative travel options, to help maintain safe social distancing…… or they can get information to help stagger their journeys - and lift the burden on public transport at peak times.This week I chaired a roundtable with key players like Google, Microsoft, and British firm, Citymapper, to develop both data and apps to help the public view crowding across the transport network, in real-time.Overall packageThis £2 billion announcement represents the most significant package of cycling, walking and green travel by any British government.Clearly, it will never be possible to cycle, walk or e-scooter everywhere. Cars will remain an absolutely vital form of transport for many….And so in the coming days…as we look to the future…… there will be further announcements about the huge investment we’re making in road and rail networks – taking advantage of their low usership during this COVID crisis.Closing remarksFinally, as we begin the process of preparing public transport to get Britain moving again, no-one should underestimate the sheer scale of the challenge ahead.Even with every train, bus and tram fully restored to service – this will not be enough.Social distancing measures mean that everyone who travels will need to contribute to meeting this capacity challenge.Changing our behaviour is the single biggest thing that’s beaten back this virus.The welcome fall we’ve seen in deaths is not only the achievement of our doctors and nurses and careworkers - but of everyone in the country for following the stay at home guidance.To re-iterate, nothing I have said today changes these basic rules.But as we contemplate the future, we will have to carry on making changes, particularly after we leave our homes.Preventing overcrowding – which could lead to a second spike and more deaths – will be the responsibility of each and every one of us.So please, only travel when you need to.Be considerate to others, and help us prioritise essential workers.And let’s all play our part in Britain moving safely again when that time comes."
Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 7 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/environment-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-8-may-2020,Foreign Secretary,2020-05-07,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 8 May 2020:Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference. I’m pleased to be joined today by Steve Powis the medical director of NHS England.Before we give an update on the latest figures on the Coronavirus and also our work to help support the vulnerable get access to food.Today is of course the 75th anniversary of VE day and although many of the lockdown measures and the social distancing measures that are in place mean that many of the planned events have been unable to take place as originally envisaged, today is an important day to pause and remember and 75 years ago people poured into the streets of our scarred cities to celebrate the end of that most difficult conflict.Our soldiers fought around the world, there were countless acts of bravery, 450,000 British people sadly lost their lives and it was a moment when our whole country pulled together.As Defra secretary I would like to take this opportunity to record the efforts of those who also contributed in a non-military way, in particular our farmers who stepped up to ensure the nation was fed and the many women who responded to the call to join the Women’s Land Army.In a moment I am going to give an update on our work to support the vulnerable get access to food, but firstly let me give you an update on the latest data from the COBR coronavirus data file. I can report through the governments ongoing monitoring and testing programme as of today:    1,631,561 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 97,029 tests carried out yesterday;        211,364 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 4,649 cases since yesterday;        11,788 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 12,688 the previous day.  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 31,241 have now died. That’s an increase of 626 fatalities since yesterday. This new figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of these victims.Turning now to our work to help the vulnerable get access to food, firstly for the so called shielded cohort. That’s those who are clinically vulnerable.Over a million food parcels have now been delivered to these households and in addition, all those in the shielded cohort have been added to a list giving them priority access to supermarket delivery slots. So far around 400,000 people have been offered priority delivery slots by supermarkets and around 1 million orders have been placed ensuring that people can shop normally and purchase the goods that they want to buy.There is of course a wider vulnerable group, those who perhaps have disabilities or who are elderly and perhaps don’t have neighbours or relatives close by to help them. Or indeed those with other conditions that don’t put them in the clinically shielded group but nevertheless make them vulnerable and we have been working with local authorities, and some of the leading charities such as Age UK to put together a package of support to help these people get access to food.And many local authorities and charities have also been accessing the Good Samaritan app as part of the NHS responder volunteer programme and so far 79,000 shopping runs have been carried out by volunteers engaged in that programme.In addition we are continuing to work with supermarkets to make available additional priority slots for those in this group. But we also recognise that the economic impacts of coronavirus means that vulnerability is not about physical access to food, for some there is also financial vulnerability, so today we are announcing a new £16 million fund to support frontline food charities. The fund will be used by Fareshare and WRAP to continue and support and increase the food redistribution work that they already do and will significantly expand their sourcing capacity. They will be delivering food to around 5,000 frontline charities and these include refuges, homeless shelters and rehabilitation centres.Finally I am conscious that there is a great deal of speculation about what the Prime Minster might say on Sunday when he outlines the roadmap for the future and how we will evolve the current restrictions. The Prime Minister will outline any changes to the guidance on Sunday but in the meantime in spite of the sunny bank holiday it is vitally important that we continue to abide by the current restrictions, stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.Concluding the press conference the Environment Secretary said:I would also as I have done before like to conclude by recording my thanks to all those working in the food industry; from supermarkets and food manufacturers right through to farmers, there has really been quite an extraordinary effort over the last couple of months to ensure that we keep food on our supermarket shelves.Thank you all very much."
Communities Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 6 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-7-may-2020,Communities Secretary,2020-05-06,"Dominic Raab leading the coronavirus press conferenceGood afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference.I’m very pleased to be joined by Sir Ian Diamond the UK’s National Statistician from the ONS, And also by Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy CMO.The latest data from our COBR coronavirus data file shows that, as of today:there have now been 1,534,533 tests for coronavirus across the UK  that includes 86,583 tests carried out yesterday  206,715 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 5,614 cases since yesterdayAnd those who tested positive, very sadly, 30,615 people have now died, and my deepest condolences go out to anyone who has lost a loved one throughout this pandemic.Three weeks ago, before the Easter bank holiday weekend, I set out five tests for the UK to move on to the next phase in this pandemic. Then, just as now, there were calls to ease up on the restrictions. But as the science made clear, we couldn’t responsibly do that. In fact, the advice from the group of scientific experts, SAGE, who advise the government made it very clear that there weren’t any changes at all that we could confidently take, Without risking a second peak of the virus.That’s why we asked the public to keep going. We weren’t done yet.We said ‘stick to the plan’, and the British public kept going. People stuck to the rules. That meant working from home, it meant worries about money it meant adjusting to home schooling, time apart from family and friends, and just not doing many of the things which we all enjoy in life.At the same time, there’s been a lot of people who, despite their own personal sacrifices, have gone the extra mile. They volunteered to support the elderly and the vulnerable in their community, who have been shielded themselves away from the virus.And each Thursday, of course, we now come together to applaud the NHS staff, and the carers, the people who just kept going to keep our country going.And because of that monumental effort we have now passed the peak of the virus. The NHS hasn’t been overwhelmed. We haven’t seen hospital wards overwhelmed with patients, people left without hospital beds, people left without the ventilators that can mean the difference between life and death.Now I know the tragic death toll in this country and around the world has been sobering for all of us, and there have been real challenges in this country – with PPE, and with care homes.But, in this first stage of the fight against COVID-19, through this national team effort, we’ve prevented the number of deaths rising to even higher levels, and we’ve ensured critically that the NHS had the capacity to cope.Today the Cabinet was updated on SAGE’s advice on the progress that we’ve made to date. And as a result of the social distancing measures that we’ve put in place the R level, which signifies the rate of infection, is now between 0.5 and 0.9. The overall number of new cases has been steadily falling and the rate of deaths is also steadily falling.Now, just to be clear about what all of this means in practice. The virus is not beaten yet.It remains deadly and infectious, and we are working very hard right across government and with local government to bring it down in areas of concern, like in care homes, and I’m confident we can do it and we will do it.But, because we held firm three weeks ago, we are now in a position to start to think about the next phase in this pandemic.So, this weekend, the Prime Minister will set out the next steps which we can responsibly take over the following weeks, guided by the scientific advice and mindful, as we’ve said right from the word go, of taking the right decisions at the right time.Now, we can start setting out how we will live and work, whilst maintaining the necessary social distancing rules, we can also be clearer about those measures which are still necessary to prevent a second peak.The Prime Minister has been directing Ministers and our teams of officials right across government to carefully develop a road-map for the next phase.It contains appropriate measures to be taken at appropriate milestones, subject to very clear conditions.And there be detailed guidance to help inform, advise and reassure the public, businesses and other organisations.To get this right, we have set milestones. Some changes can confidently be introduced more quickly than others, and some of those other ones will take longer to introduce.And, it’s important to say this, at each point along the way when we take these decisions, they will be based on the five tests and the scientific advice that we receive.And as I set out in the fifth of our five tests when I spoke here at this lectern, on 16 April, the point at which we make even the smallest of changes to the current guidance will be a point of maximum risk.If people abandon the social distancing, if we forget the sacrifices that were made to get us through the peak, to get us to this point, the virus will grow again at an exponential rate.That would lead to a second peak which would threaten the NHS. It would trigger another lockdown, which prolong the economic pain, and we we’re determined to keep it temporary, to keep it as short as possible.So, we’ve kept the current measures in place for this long, precisely so that we can bounce back with vigour and energy as soon as possible, as soon as it is responsible to start looking at the second phase.And because of that, our next steps will be surefooted and sustainable. Any changes we make will be carefully monitored. If people don’t follow the new rules, or if we see that the R-level goes back up, we will tighten the restrictions again, we will always retain the option to do so. That way we can safeguard public health and we can also safeguard the economy in a sustainable way.So having prepared carefully, and based on the updated advice from SAGE, this weekend, the Prime Minister will set out the roadmap for the next phase, along with the conditions for reaching each milestone.That way we can provide the country with a better understanding of what lies ahead, we can offer reassurance that we will adjust the restrictions to the minimum necessary to prevent a second spike in the virus, and we can give people the confidence that we’re doing it in a way that will protect life and preserve our way of life.Read the government’s guidance about to coronavirus.Coronavirus press conference 7 May 2020    Follow the Foreign Office on Twitter @foreignoffice and Facebook        Follow the Foreign Office on Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn        Media enquiries            For journalists                                   Email              newsdesk@fco.gov.uk"
Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/communities-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-6-may-2020,Foreign Secretary,2020-05-05,"videoGood afternoon,Welcome to the coronavirus press conference from Downing Street.I’m joined this afternoon by Professor Yvonne Doyle Medical Director for Public Health England and Dr Nikki Kanani Deputy Medical Director of Primary Care for NHS England.Today’s data shows that:1,448,010 tests for coronavirus have now been carried across Great Britain, including 69,463 tests carried out yesterday  201,101 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 6,111 cases since yesterday  13,615 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in Great Britain, down from 13,922 the yesterday  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 30,076 have now died. That’s an increase of 649 fatalities since yesterday.Behind that number is a heart-breaking loss for the loved ones of all those who have died, and once again our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends.Professor Yvonne Doyle will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus.But first, as Communities Secretary I would like to take this opportunity to give an update the work being done locally during the pandemic to keep people safe, to provide support people’s jobs and businesses and to prepare for the re-opening and recovery of our local economies.That’s why it is appropriate that today we are joined by regional journalists who are doing so much to keeping people informed about how the national effort is being co-ordinated in their communities.A free country needs a free press and the national, the regional and the local newspapers are under significant financial pressure.I’d like to echo the words of the Culture Secretary recently in encouraging those who can, to buy a newspaper.I have said before that the battle against coronavirus would be won in every city, town and village across the country.This is a national effort taking place at a local level.My department, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, has played a vital role in bringing people together to tackle the virus.We’ve provided local authorities with over £3.2 billion during this pandemic so that they can continue to support the communities that need it through this most challenging time and respond to the immediate pressures they are facing due to coronavirus, while also protecting and preserving vital public services.And at the start of March I established a taskforce to support Local Resilience Forums – known as LRFs – standing them up at a local level across the country, to prepare each and every community for a range of scenarios.There are 38 LRFs in England which are made up of emergency services, a range of government agencies, health bodies and local authorities.They are headed by the most senior and experienced local leaders of the emergency services, councils, the NHS and others who together are leading their communities through this crisis with the full support of central government.Recognising the unprecedented challenge that we faced, I took the decision to embed within them some of the finest military planners in the world from our armed forces and I am very grateful for their work.This combined expertise and leadership is ensuring a comprehensive, co-ordinated and consistent response across the country.Responding to the urgent need for personal protective equipment to reach the frontline of the care sector, we’ve mobilised LRFs to help distribute PPE and thus far they have delivered over 67 million items in England alone, since early April.Together with local councils, they are also assisting us in supporting some of the most vulnerable individuals in their communities and to date they have helped to ensure that a million boxes of food and essentials have now been delivered to those people identified by the NHS as extremely clinically vulnerable to coronavirus, the “shielded”.With more than 290,000 boxes being distributed every week, this has been a huge team effort, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved for the role that they have played and will play in the weeks ahead.We are also working very closely with Mayors to make sure that we have a coordinated approach to tackling coronavirus at a local level.The government has also been determined to ensure that the vital work keeping people safe in their homes also continues.So, with the support of the Mayors for London, the Liverpool City Region, Greater Manchester, Sheffield and the West Midlands, and others, we were able to announce the Building Safety Pledge.These Mayors have come together because they have a number of high rise buildings with highly flammable cladding in their respective regions, and the pledge that we agreed, sends a very clear message that vital building safety work must continue, despite the coronavirus pandemic.And we have been joined by 25 local authorities, including 18 in London, have also given their fulsome support.As work on many of these critical sites was paused early on, it is now slowly starting to reassume as a result of this initiative.And I would urge any building owner or contractor to do so, as soon as practicable, where it is safe to begin work once again.Now coronavirus will not stop our mission to level-up, to unite and to unleash the potential of this country.The Prime Minister will set out on Sunday our approach the second phase of this pandemic.As we look ahead to supporting businesses as they are able to re-open, my department will lead our work on how our local economies can adapt, evolve, recover and grow.I will continue to support mayors and local government leaders, who will play critical roles in this work.Every local economy now needs a plan to re-start and recover.We will be informing those plans with our own detailed work in areas such as:How workplaces, from factories to construction sites to offices can be adapted.  How outdoor spaces, leisure and businesses, from parks, to high streets, to markets can be managed.  And how public transport networks, from the tube, to trams, to buses, can operate.In each case, guided by scientific and medical advice, we want to ensure appropriate and safe social distancing, providing the public with the confidence to return to work, and to return to public spaces, to public transport and to school, knowing that it’s always safe to do so.We are considering how we can create more room in the town centre for pedestrians.How we can make it easier to cycle or walk to work.And we will work with towns and places whose economies have been hardest hit intensively as the recovery begins.And our commitment to infrastructure investment remains undimmed.For example, over two thirds of HS2 sites are open.We want infrastructure and construction work to begin again wherever it is safe to do so.It is clear to everyone that the pandemic is putting huge pressure on economies the world over.And there is no denying the challenges lie ahead in our own country.But we cannot, and will not, let this pandemic halt our work to improve connectivity, to provide vital social and cultural infrastructure and to boost economic growth across the regions.That’s is how we will begin to rebuild and recover from this national emergency.We are working to ensure the right support is available to local businesses.And last week high street businesses began to receive the £22 million package designed to mitigate some of the effects of coronavirus.With grants of us to £25,000 being paid into bank accounts of those business.And of course the 100 towns benefiting from our £3.6 billion Towns Fund will continue to receive our support.And we will be working at pace with them in the months ahead.Local authorities have now paid out over £8.6 billion in grants to around 700,000 businesses.As Local Government Secretary I’d like to congratulate those councils that have worked extremely hard sometimes around the clock to get those grants out to the businesses that desperately need them.I’d like to congratulate Chichester, Ealing and Hyndburn councils who are the three highest performing councils so far in England.Businesses are also receiving discounts of almost £10 billion on their rates bills in response to COVID-19, with the hardest hit by the pandemic, such as shops, cafes and pubs, paying no business rates whatsoever this financial year.Together with existing reliefs, this means that 1.1 million ratepayers are no longer paying business rates this year.This week the Chancellor and I announced an additional 5% uplift – up to £617 million – available to local councils to fund small businesses that rent space in shared offices, industrial units or innovation centres, as well as regular market traders, B&Bs that pay council tax rather than business rates and also to support small charities.And local councils will now how have flexibility to make pragmatic decisions to keep those business going so they can bounce back once they are able to do so.Moving forward, our mission is to do everything we can to help people get back to work safely, to reunite friends and family and reintroduce the things that make life worth living in a safe way, as soon as it is safe to do so.Finally, on Friday, we will celebrating as a country the 75th anniversary of VE Day.My department had been helping to plan some of the public celebrations, but we know that sadly we will now all need to mark this important occasion from home instead.Cabinet colleagues have been speaking with veteran organised by The Royal British Legion and I had the pleasure earlier this week of speaking to Leslie, a 98-year-old World War Two veteran, on the phone.Leslie was full of warmth and wisdom, telling me how he spent VE Day in Siena having fought his way through North Africa and Italy, and how he would be spending Friday, more sedately, celebrating, at home.As he said to me, that as we rebuilt and recovered then, he is certain we’ll do so again this year."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 4 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-may-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-05-04,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 5 May 2020:Coronavirus press conference 5 May 2020.Welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m joined by Professor Angela McLean, Chief Scientific Advisor at the MOD.First, let me give an update on the latest data that we have on coronavirus. I can report through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme that as of today:    there have now been 1,383,842 tests for coronavirus across the UK, including 84,806 tests yesterday        we know that 194,990 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 4,406 cases since yesterday        and of those who have tested positive, 29,427 have very sadly died, and our hearts go out to everyone who has lost a loved one throughout the coronavirus challenge  We continue to see evidence of a flattening of the peak of this virus. But, as the figures that I have just read out show, it’s is not over yet. So, in the coming days, SAGE will be updating ministers with the latest scientific advice.As ever, we will make sure that we continue to be guided by their advice as we take the decisions on next steps in fighting the virus. Alongside the advice from SAGE, our 5 tests remain absolutely key.    first, we must continue to boost NHS capacity, so that the NHS cannot be overwhelmed        second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the number of deaths        thirdly, we must see further reductions in the rate of infection to manageable levels, across all different areas and settings        fourth, we must be confident that the NHS will be able to cope with future demands, including as a result of any changes that we make to existing measures or indeed any new measures we might wish to take        fifth, and above all, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that could then overwhelm the NHS  Later on this week, the Prime Minister will update the country on the measures and decisions we will need to take to protect the NHS, to safeguard the economy and avoid the risk of a second peak that would be damaging both for public health, but also for jobs and the wider economy.As we consider the decisions we will take next, to protect life, but also to protect our way of life, it’s now clear that the second phase will be different. We will need to adjust to a new normal where we as a society adapt to safe new ways to work, to travel, to interact and to go about our daily lives,We’ve never experienced anything like this first stage of COVID-19, in terms of the scale of the lives lost but also the lockdown that it has required. As we go forward, we want to make sure that the next phase is more comfortable, is more sustainable and prevents lasting damage to jobs and livelihoods.But we need to be under no illusions, the next stage won’t be easy. And if we’re going to protect life and preserve our way of life we must continue to be guided by the scientific advice we receive, and make sure the next steps we take are sure-footed and sustainable.Before I hand over to Angela to run through the data slides, I want to provide an update on one further feature that coronavirus as a challenge has thrown up for this country, and indeed, for the whole world.Whilst the vast majority of people, and countries have come together and rallied to this international mission to defeat coronavirus, there will always be some who seek to exploit a crisis for their own criminal and hostile ends.We know that cyber criminals, and other malicious groups are targeting individuals, businesses, and other organisations by deploying COVID-19 related scams and phishing emails. That includes groups that in the cyber security world are known as ‘advanced persistent threat’ groups – sophisticated networks of hackers who try to breach computer systems. We have clear evidence now that these criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations, which are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, which I have to say makes them particularly venal and dangerous at this time.We are working with the targets of those attacks, with the potential targets, and with others, to make sure that they are aware of the cyber threat, and that they can take the steps necessary to protect themselves or, at the very least, mitigate the harm that could be brought against them.With that in mind, today, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have published a joint warning about these groups.And we’ve offered some advice on the cyber criminals and other actors who are seeking to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic through malicious cyber activity. Our teams have identified campaigns targeting healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, research organisations, and also various different arms of local government.There are various objectives and motivations that lie behind these attacks, from fraud on the one hand to espionage. But they tend to be designed to steal bulk personal data, intellectual property and wider information that supports those aims, and they are often linked with other state actors.We expect this kind of predatory criminal behaviour to continue and evolve over the coming weeks and months ahead, and we are taking a range of measures to tackle the threat. So, as we have done today, we will share advice on the nature of those threats to enable business, citizens and our international partners to better defend themselves against the full range of cyber-attack – from hostile states to criminal gangs.Preventive action is often the very best way to deny attackers the opportunities they are looking for. The  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) offers a range of practical advice to safeguard against cyber-attacks. From things like the use of online passwords, to guidance on trusted sources of online information relating to COVID-19 like the GOV.UK sites or Public Health England.As well as providing practical advice, the UK will continue to counter those who conduct cyber-attacks. And we’re working very closely with our international partners both to respond to the threats, but also to deter the gangs and the arms of state who lie behind them.We’re absolutely determined to defeat coronavirus, and also to defeat those trying to exploit the situation for their own nefarious ends.Read the government’s guidance about to coronavirus.

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-4-may-2020,Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,2020-05-03,"Delivered on:       4 May 2020 (Original script, may differ from delivered versionCoronavirus press conference: 4 May 2020Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.I’m joined by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Professor Jonathan Van Tam, and our national testing coordinator, Professor John Newton.Today, I want to update you with the latest plans for our programme of test, track and trace and how we are going to use this massive testing capability that we’ve built to get R down and keep R down.Before I do, I just want to remind you of what we are trying to achieve.Our plan is to slow the spread and protect the NHS, so the NHS is always there for you and your family whenever you need it, whether for coronavirus or anything else as we lead the nation through this crisis.Our goal is working.The number of spare critical care beds in the NHS is 3,413.On the latest figures:there have been 1,291,000 tests for coronavirus, including 85,186 tests on Sunday, yesterday  190,584 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 3,985  13,258 people are in hospital with coronavirus  and 28,734 people have died, an increase of 288That figure is lower than at any point since the end of March. But, as with testing, these reported figures tend to be lower over the weekend so we do expect that number to rise.And remember, this is not just a number but it is a constant, insistent reminder that we must go further and faster in our national effort in dealing with this virus.Over the last month we have built a national testing infrastructure capable of over 100,000 tests a day. Today, the capacity stands at 108,000.This means we are now in a position to start implementing the next part of our plan: track and trace.The aim of test, track and trace is to hunt down and isolate the virus so it’s unable to reproduce. And, crucially, test, track and trace allows us to take a more targeted approach to lockdown while still safely containing the disease.Creating this system is a huge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity. We’ve already taken Britain’s small but brilliant diagnostics industry and taken it to global scale. We’re building an army of human contact tracers who can man the phones, and find the contacts and support people. And, of course, we’re developing the contact tracing app, which can help us deliver test, track and trace on the mass scale that we need across the country.The app, which takes full consideration of privacy and security, has already been tested in closed conditions at an RAF base. And, today, I can announce the next steps.From tomorrow, we will begin to pilot test, track and trace on the Isle of Wight, starting with health professionals and rolling out this week to all citizens. I am grateful to the huge enthusiasm shown by islanders, who know that by participating in this pilot they are at the forefront of helping get Britain back on her feet.Where the Isle of Wight goes, Britain follows.The island has a single NHS Trust, one local authority with the responsibility for public health, a relatively low number of COVID cases and, because it’s an island, we can run this trial in proper scientifically controlled conditions, comparing the effect with what’s going on in the mainland before we roll it out to the rest of the country.So here’s how it will work.Last week, we put in place the testing capability on the island. From tonight, the contact tracing capability will go live. And then, tomorrow, NHS staff on the island will be able to download the app.And, from Thursday, each one of the 80,000 households on the island will get a letter from the Chief Nurse with comprehensive information about the trial. Islanders will then be asked to install the app. Once you’ve installed the app, it will start logging the distance between your phone and other phones with an app nearby.It’s been designed with a form of Bluetooth that conserves power so the app won’t drain your battery.This log of proximity information will then be securely stored on your phone.If you become unwell with COVID symptoms, you inform the NHS via the app. Other app users who you’ve had significant contact with in the last few days will then be sent an alert by the NHS, along with advice about what to do.A test-ordering function will then be built in.If you’re watching this and you live on the Isle of Wight, I have a simple message: please, download the app to protect the NHS and save lives. By downloading the app, you’re protecting your own health, the health of your loved ones and the health of your community.I know the people of the Isle of Wight will embrace this with enthusiasm, because, by embracing test, track and trace, you will be saving lives.The pilot is important to help make sure this app works as well as it possibly can alongside the contact tracing system. And with your help we will learn a lot, we will use it to make things better and we want to hear from you.I want to stress – and this is really important – that this trial does not mean the end of social distancing on the Isle of Wight, or anywhere else for that matter. We will only change the social distancing rules once our 5 tests are met.So, I’ll end with the instruction that we all know: please, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Or, if you live on the Isle of Wight: stay at home, install the app, protect the NHS and save lives."
Communities Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 2 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-duchy-of-lancasters-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-3-may,Communities Secretary,2020-05-02,"Coronavirus press conference 3 May 2020Good afternoon and welcome to this No10 press conference on our progress in the fight against COVID 19.I am joined today by Professor Steve Powis, the National Medical Director at NHS England.In a moment or two I will hand over to Steve to take us through the slide updates from the Cabinet Office briefing room.But first I want to set out the latest coronavirus data.1,206,405 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 76,496 yesterday.Overall, 186,599 people have tested positive. That’s an increase of 4,339 cases since yesterday.14,248 people are currently being treated in hospital for coronavirus, compared to 14,695 yesterday.Sadly, of those who have tested positive for coronavirus across all settings, 28,446 have died.Behind the numbers there has been an increase of 315 deaths since yesterday across all settings.This pandemic has claimed more than 28,000 lives, and each one of them is precious, each one valued, each one irreplaceable.The pain of bereavement and heartbreak is deeply personal.But as a society, we are showing care and compassion across boundaries, offering support and a chance to talk through grief together.For those experiencing the first Ramadan without a loved one, this will be a particularly painful time. I send my sincere condolences to all families who are grieving.As with Christians who could not celebrate Easter together in church, and the Jewish community whose Passover rituals were affected by social distancing, our thoughts are with Muslim neighbours who cannot break their fast together and must adapt their religious and cultural practices because of the crisis.We have all learned to adapt, and we must carry on doing so after the Prime Minister sets out how we will get back to work later this week. His comprehensive plan will explain how we can get our economy moving, how we can get our children back to school, how we can travel to work more safely and how we can make life in the workplace safer.But before we can ease the existing restrictions we must ensure the government’s five tests are met – that the number of cases are falling, that death rates are declining, that the NHS has what it needs and that measures are in place to stop a second peak overwhelming the NHS.I am particularly conscious that those in the frontline of our public services will need clear guidance on safe working, they’ll need the right personal protective equipment and appropriate access to testing if we are to make all the progress that we want in the weeks ahead.We are consulting with employers and unions, professionals and public health experts, to establish how we can ensure that we have the safest possible working environments and the Prime Minister will be saying more later next week.On personal protective equipment for key workers, we are increasing the spread of distribution and supply.From February 25 to May 2 we have delivered over 1.08 billion items of PPE across the health and social care system within England – and tens of millions more have been distributed by our colleagues in the Devolved Administrations.This overall figure includes:149 million masks  173 million aprons  2 million gowns  614 million glovesOn 2 May alone, we delivered an additional 20 million items of PPE within England.But there is much more to do and the work led by Lord Deighton to improve domestic production of PPE is vital to our efforts.And on testing, thanks to the hard work of so many across the NHS, Public Health England, our pharmaceutical sector and our universities, we have tested over 200,000 key workers and their families, allowing those who don’t have the virus to go back to work, and protecting those who do.We have now, of course, extended the criteria for testing beyond key workers to anyone over 65 displaying symptoms, and anyone who has to travel to get to work.And this week we will be piloting new test, track and trace procedures on the Isle of Wight with a view to having them in place more widely later this month.All of these steps will help us to get more people back to work and help to support the delivery of our public services.And I want to thank those who have done so much to maintain the provision of critical public services during this crisis.Our teachers have worked incredibly hard to provide educational support to millions.And the government has committed £100m to boost remote learning for those who need it most. Our newly-launched Oak National Academy is supplementing all the work going on by schools and teachers by providing 180 video lessons each week.We are particularly keen to help vulnerable and disadvantaged children carry on with their education during the pandemic. Schools continue to receive additional funding in the form of the pupil premium, for those pupils who most deserve it – worth around £2.4 billion annually.We have ordered laptops to help disadvantaged young people who will be sitting key exams next year. We are also providing laptops and tablets for those children with social workers and care leavers, to help them stay in touch with the services they need, keeping them safe and supporting home learning.And if disadvantaged secondary school pupils and care leavers who are preparing for exams do not have internet access, we will provide free routers to get them connected while schools are closed.Over the Easter holidays, we were able to ensure that more than 60 percent of schools were open every day, with places for both vulnerable children and those of critical workers.And the Free School Meal Voucher Scheme ensured that children who needed it can continue to access food despite school closures. So far, 15,500 schools have placed orders for vouchers, of which over £35 million has been redeemed.The latest available data shows that around 49,000 of the children in attendance on April 24 were classed by schools as vulnerable – more than double the figure from a week earlier.While this is going in the right direction, we estimate this still represents only around one in ten of all children and young people classified as vulnerable. We want to see this figure go up further, and we’re working with local authorities, schools and colleges to provide improved support to vulnerable young people.Support for local authorities/militaryAll this additional support of course takes time, puts pressure on existing staff and costs money.That is why we have pledged an additional £1.6bn to councils across England to support their essential frontline services including adult social care. This sum takes the funding given to councils to over £3.2billion, to help communities through the crisis.We have also deployed military support to assist the public sector. The Covid Support Force mobilised by the MoD is now 20,000-strong.Today, over 3,600 personnel are deployed in support of 86 separate projects in which military aid is being given to civil authorities.On a national level, they are helping the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the Department of Health and Social Care and also the NHS, with planning and logistics in England, Scotland and Wales.On the ground, they are helping to build and to staff temporary Nightingale hospitals, and to operate both Regional Testing Centres for coronavirus, of which there are now 49 around the country. And also the Mobile Testing Units that we are rolling out: to date there are 77 of them.Across the country, 156 military planners are embedded at grass-roots level with our existing Local Resilience Forums – partnerships of emergency services, local authorities, the NHS, the Environment Agency and others. They are helping to coordinate and protect our vital local services and supplies, with the additional support of senior Whitehall officials.In addition, we have to thank local government for their energetic work, because since the end of March, 90 percent of rough sleepers known to councils have been made an offer of accommodation, reassuring them about their safety.The government, more widely, is also working hard to support those who have not been identified as ‘shielded’ but are still vulnerable. In the coming days, we will be delivering our one millionth parcel of essential food to those at highest risk across the country.Up to 200,000 telephone calls a day are being made to the shielded, and councils are helping to support them in other ways - including organising regular calls from volunteers to those who are isolated.In our communities, the support put in place by many local organisations has been inspirational as people step up to help friends and neighbours.The government has helped to mobilise another important lifeline through the NHS Volunteers Responders programme.Over 600,000 people have had their ID verified and are helping with the daily errands that make such a significant difference - collecting shopping, making contact as a human voice on the end of a telephone, transporting patients and supplies for the NHS.And, of course, we are all working with supermarkets to ensure that a greater number of online delivery slots are made available to those most in need.Importance of working as a team across the UKIn every one of these areas, the government in Westminster has been working with ministers from the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Executive. This has helped us to monitor and react to the path of the virus across the nations, enabling us to intervene wherever people are in need.At each of these daily press conferences, we have paid tribute to the compassion and dedication of our key public-sector workers.I recognise how much we all owe to their stoicism and steadfastness. Nurses, doctors, porters, cleaners, paramedics, pharmacists, care home staff, prison and police officers, teachers, social workers, those preparing and delivering food, collecting our refuse and administering our welfare system. They deserve our gratitude, they deserve our support, they are in all our minds. They are the very best of us.We owe them so much – and we in government will do everything we can to support them during the next phases of our pandemic response.I will now hand over to Professor Steve Powis to take us through the latest developments on the pandemic."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 1 May 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/communities-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-2-may-2020--2,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-05-01,"videoGood afternoon,Welcome to the coronavirus press conference from Downing Street.I’m joined by Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England.Today’s data shows that:    1,129,907 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 105,937 tests carried out yesterday.        182,260 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 4,806 cases since yesterday.        14,695 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 15,111 yesterday.        And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 28,131 have now died. That’s an increase of 621 fatalities since yesterday.  These are heart-breaking losses for every family affected, and our thoughts and prayers are with their families and their friends.Jenny will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus.But first, as Communities Secretary, I want to update on the steps we are taking to protect some of the most vulnerable people in our society.As the Prime Minister set out this week, we have now passed the peak of this virus.And he will provide more details on how we will address the second phase of this battle next week.We all know that the restrictive measures – as necessary and as lifesaving as they are – are difficult for everyone.All of you watching at home this afternoon have made sacrifices big and small, and I want to thank you once again for all that you are doing.You are helping us as a country to turn the tide on coronavirus.But for some in our society these measures involve sacrifices that none of us would wish anyone to bear.For victims of domestic abuse, it means being trapped in a nightmare.The true evil of domestic abuse is that it leaves vulnerable people, including children, living in fear in the very place where they should feel most safe and secure – inside their own home.Though domestic violence can leave physical marks, the true extent of the inflicted pain is much deeper than those marks – it can invisible, these are emotional scars.Scars that may never heal and which can even pass to the next generation, whose young eyes see things that they never should.And hear things that none of us would wish our children to witness.As a father of 3 girls, I cannot even imagine women and young children being put in this situation.But they are, and we must be alive to the reality of what is happening on all too many homes across the country.I want us to defend the rights of those women and children wherever we can, and that is what we are going to do.And this is not a crime inflicted solely on women: it affects men too.This government has already prioritised tackling domestic abuse.The Domestic Abuse Bill, which had its second reading in Parliament last week, is a landmark piece of legislation which will create the first ever legal definition of domestic abuse.And this is important because it holds those responsible to account and gives those suffering at the hands of others more confidence that action will be taken and perpetrators brought to justice.Today, I can confirm that through the Domestic Abuse Bill, the government will also be ensuring that victims of domestic violence get the ‘priority need’ status they need to access local housing services much more easily.This is a fully funded commitment which will mean that no victim of domestic violence has to make the unbearable choice between staying somewhere where they know is unsafe or becoming homeless.This government has been clear that we are determined to break the silence that surrounds victims, to stamp out the stigma and strengthen our support for survivors.We have already announced an extra £15 million to strengthen our support, and an extra £16 million is going directly to refuge services.But we recognise that the extra pressures that are being created due to COVID-19 and that necessitates more support.While the necessary social distancing measures remain in place, it is harder than before for victims of domestic abuse to reach out to their friends, to their family, to colleagues, and neighbours for the support that they urgently need.Today I can announce a package of over £76 million in new funding to support the most vulnerable in society during the pandemic.This funding will help charities support survivors of domestic and sexual abuse, it will support vulnerable children and their families and victims of modern slavery.This additional support will ensure more safe spaces and accommodation for survivors of domestic abuse and their children and the recruitment of additional counsellors for victims of sexual violence.And this funding will also help front line charities to be able to offer different ways of supporting those in need, including through virtual or phone based services.We know that some refuges have had to reduce or even to cancel their services they would want to provide during this pandemic.This funding will help them to meet the challenges posed in this national emergency and to continue to help those that desperately need support.I’d like to say a word of thanks to domestic abuse charities who are doing so much at this time to help so many people.The Women’s Aid refuge in my constituency is one example.I’d like to thank Marlene and her amazing team in Newark. People like that do incredible work and deserve all our thanks and gratitude now more than ever before.Where refuges don’t have enough capacity to support those in need during the pandemic, some have asked if they could use hotels or other accommodation nearby on a temporary basis.For example, as move-on accommodation, where they judge it to be safe and appropriate to do so. We will work with refuges to make this option available to them, if they judge it to be the right one where it’s necessary.And thank you also to pharmacies, such as Boots, who are providing a safe space for victims of domestic abuse in some of their shops, and are training more of their staff to be able to support those people when they come into the stores, so they can safely provide support and contact services for help and advice.For any victims of domestic abuse watching at home this afternoon, let me say once again that you are not alone.You do not have to stay at home. You can and should leave the home if you are in danger.Victims should call 999 if in an emergency or if you are in danger and unable to talk call 999 then press 55.Our outstanding police will be there for you. They will help you.And if you need support please call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247 at any time.Secondly, we have also been working with councils and charities to protect those sleeping who have been sleeping on our streets; a group particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.We set out to bring people in from the streets.So far, more than 5,400 rough sleepers known to councils have been offered safe accommodation in just under a month – ensuring some of the most vulnerable people can stay safe during the pandemic.This means that over 90% of rough sleepers known to councils have been offered accommodation where they can self-isolate during the crisis.This country is viewed around the world as having taken one of the most intensive and successful approaches to protecting rough sleepers during the pandemic.This was the right thing to do.By working with charities, local council, churches, faith groups and volunteers, we have helped to protect thousands of lives.I am extremely grateful to everyone who has been involved in this phenomenal national effort.Today I am announcing that Dame Louise Casey, who is already leading a review into rough sleeping and advising the government on ending it within this Parliament, has been appointed by the Prime Minister and I to spearhead this new government initiative and she will lead a new taskforce.In this role, she will oversee our national effort to ensure that thousands of rough sleepers now in safer accommodation continue to receive the physical and mental health support they need, while they self-isolate during the pandemic.And she will work hand-in-hand with councils and with other groups across the country to plan how we can ensure as many people as possible can move into long-term, sustainable and safe accommodation they deserve once the pandemic is over.We are determined that as few people as possible return to life on the streets, and I can think of nobody better than Louise to help us to achieve this.This is a major challenge and I don’t pretend that this second phase will be easy or that we will succeed in every case.But we will apply the same energy and commitment and determination to this national effort as we did to the first.And I am certain that the charities, the councils and the volunteers the people across the length and breath of the country that have achieved so much in the last month will do the same job again.Thirdly, and in closing, I’d like to update you on our shielding programme.For those who have been identified by the NHS as being extremely clinically vulnerable due to underlying health conditions, that’s now 1.8 million people in England alone.They have been asked to stay at home with no face-to-face contact outside their household, except for their carers, for those people in the shielding group who don’t have family or friends to support them, we’ve offered to provide a basic weekly package of food and essentials.I’m delighted to say today that we expect that the 1 millionth shielding package will be delivered in the next few days.This service is entirely without precedent – nothing on this scale has been attempted in this country at least since the Second World War.I am incredibly proud of the team who helped us deliver it.I have loved reading the emails I have received from people who have got the boxes and seeing the photos that have posted on social media.I said at the start of this process that there are many people who we are asking to be at home for a prolonged period of time as a result of the virus.Not least in the shielded category but that we as a government and as a country that they may be alone at home but that they shouldn’t feel that that they are on their own.You are not, and never will be."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-1-may-2020,Prime Minister,2020-04-30,"Coronavirus press conference: 1 May 2020Good afternoon and welcome once again to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.I’m joined today by Professor John Newton, who co-ordinates our work on testing, and Professor Stephen Powis, who is the Medical Director of the NHS.Every day we are working through our plan to protect life and protect the NHS by slowing the spread and building the capacity so that, at all times, the NHS has got the capacity to give can offer the very best care to everyone who needs it.In today’s briefing, after setting out the daily statistics, I want to talk about testing.But beforehand I would like to share some really good news. Earlier this week, I said that we are now able to begin the restoration of NHS services. Now that we are past the peak, I can tell you about the next step ‒ the restoration of fertility services.Few families have been untouched by the amazing advances in fertility treatment over the past generation, and I know just how time-sensitive fertility treatment can be. And I know how important it is to the families affected. And I know that this treatment can change lives for the better, forever.So when I say thank you to all of you everybody watching for staying at home to protect the NHS, of course I’m saying thank you on behalf of the lives you are saving. But I’m also saying thanks on behalf of the lives that the NHS can now once again, help to create.Because, together, we have protected the NHS, and now we are now restoring the NHS, and restoring the chance for so many couples to start a family.Daily statisticsTurning to the figures, 177,454 people have tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 6,201 since yesterday. 15,111 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus and 27,510 people have now sadly died across all settings, an increase of 739. As one, we will remember them and treasure their memories.This is a virus that has a devastating impact on families, friends, on local communities. And right across government, we are working day and night to defeat it.At the beginning of last month, at this podium, I set a goal that anyone who needs a test should get a test. And that as a nation, we should achieve 100,000 tests per day by the end of the month. I knew that it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal because testing is so important for getting Britain back on her feet.I can announce that we have met our goal. The number of tests, yesterday, on the last day of April, was 122,347.This unprecedented expansion in British testing capability is an incredible achievement. But it is not my achievement. It is a national achievement, achieved by a huge team of people working together.And I tell you this: the testing capacity that we built, together, will help every single person in this country.Testing is crucial to suppress the virus.I know from personal experience, too, just how much people with symptoms want to know if they have got the disease. I know that I did. It helps remove the worry, it helps keep people safe, and it will help us to unlock the lockdown.So many people have tragically died and the challenge that we still face is so huge, but we are making real progress.I want to take a moment to thank and pay tribute to the incredible team who did this together and who joined together in one of the greatest national mobilisations that we’ve seen.We brought together the best civil servants, the best minds from the private sector, the best scientists, the best lab technicians and the best of the best in the armed forces.Setting stretching, ambitious goals in a crisis has a galvanising effect on everyone involved. It’s a mission. If we hadn’t been so bold, if we had chosen a safer, easier path, I just can’t see how we would have built the capacity that we need.In a short few weeks, we’ve:    created a new test for the virus        built a network of regional testing centres        put a fleet of mobile testing units on the road        and created home testing kits, so if you can’t get to a test, we can get the test to you  We’ve more than doubled the capacity of NHS and Public Health England labs, and created 3 brand new mega-labs to analyse the results.So many people have played a part in this work. British diagnostic companies like Randox and Oxford Nanopore and Medical Wire and DNANudge and Samba. Logistics companies like the Royal Mail and Yodel, who were brilliant and got us out of a real hole this week. Academics like Professor Derek Crook and Sir John Bell from Oxford, and Professor Ara Darzi from Imperial.Deloitte and Boots who have delivered our drive-through centres, AstraZeneca, GSK and Novacyte, whose lab goes on stream next week, Public Health England and the NHS, of course, who pulled out all the stops. Professor Sharon Peacock, Professor John Newton And UK Biocentre and the Crick, who set up high-tech laboratories.And also it wasn’t just a national effort. People from across the world ‒ including ThermoFisher, Hologic, Abbott and Amazon from the US, Qiagen from Germany and Roche from Switzerland.And this is how we did it. Because everybody everyone worked together with grit and determination to reach a shared goal, and they thrived because the team contained a diversity of perspectives, backgrounds and, critically, a diversity of thought.And when things went wrong, which they did every single day, believe me, we didn’t ask who we could blame – we asked how we could fix it.So, to my team, I want to say: you toiled tirelessly, night and day, and I am so proud of what you have achieved. To all of you, on behalf of the government and on behalf of the whole country, thank you.As the Prime Minister has said, a big increase in testing provides a way to unlock the puzzle of coronavirus, and testing forms the first element of our plan to test, track and trace.By mid-May we will have an initial 18,000 contact tracers in place. That work is underway as we speak. And if it needs to be bigger, we will scale it as required.The combination of contact tracers and new technology, through our new COVID-19 NHS app will help tell us where the virus is spreading and help everyone to control new infections.People will be able to know if they have been in close contact with someone who is transmitting the disease, and take the action that they need to. Our full-scale test, track and trace model will drive the infection rate down and the lower the R, and the lower the number of new infections, the more effective the track and trace system will be.Tracking and tracing will allow us to get R down, and hold R down, and so it will allow us to lift lockdown measures.Now this disease affects us all indiscriminately, we’ve seen that. In recent weeks, we have had to impinge on historic liberties to protect our NHS and our loved ones, and yet our goal must be freedom. Freedom from the virus, yes – and we will not lift measures until it is safe to do so.But also we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom too. Each citizen’s right to do as they please. For now, we are working together to stay home. We are impinging on the freedom of all, for the safety of all.With this next mission, of test, track and trace, I am seeking a solution that allows us – by each of us participating – to target the measures that are needed with much more precision, and so to reassert as much as is safely possible, the liberty of us all.That is our next mission. But for now, the most important thing for everyone to do, to keep R down and to get us all through this, is to maintain the spirit and the resolve that has had such an impact thus far.So, please, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."
Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 29 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-29-april-2020,Foreign Secretary,2020-04-29,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 29 April 2020: Coronavirus press conference 29 April 2020Welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference. I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Jonathan Van Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, and also Professor Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England.Let me just start by saying, I think on behalf of us all, huge congratulations to the Prime Minister and to Carrie on the wonderful news of the birth of their baby boy. I’ve spoken to the Prime Minister and I can tell you that both mum and son are doing really well.Next, let me give an update on the latest data on coronavirus from our COBR data file.I can report that, through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today, there have now been:    818,539 tests for the virus across the UK, including 52,429 tests that took place yesterday        165,221 people have tested positive, and that’s an increase of 4,076 cases on yesterday’s number  As the Health Secretary announced yesterday, from today, we are moving to an improved daily reporting system for deaths, so that deaths in all settings are included, wherever the individual has tested positive for COVID-19, rather than just those in hospitals.And those figures show that, up to yesterday, on the new measure, we have recorded an additional 3,811 deaths in total and I think it is just important to say that those additional deaths were spread over the period from the 2nd March to 28th April, so they don’t represent a sudden surge in the number of deaths.Sadly today’s figures show an additional 765 deaths compared to yesterday. I will let Professor Doyle talk us through the data in detail. I think we must never lose sight of the fact that behind every statistic, there are many human lives that have been tragically lost before their time.We also pay tribute, of course, to those caring for the sick, and yesterday at 11am the whole country observed a minute’s silence, a moment to reflect on the sacrifice of all of our frontline workers who have died whilst dedicating themselves to caring for others and serving others.On 16 April, I set out 5 principles that would guide our approach to the transition away from the current set of social distancing measures in place, and into a second phase.We continue to see evidence in the data of a flattening of the peak of the virus, which is only happening because we have delivered on two of the central pillars of our strategic approach to defeating coronavirus.First, we reinforced our NHS capacity, through the Nightingale hospitals, extra critical care capacity, more ventilator beds and extra doctors and nurses on the frontline.And, second, we introduced social distancing measures, at the right time, guided by the scientific and medical evidence.The public’s overwhelming support for those rules has helped to save lives and protect the NHS from becoming overwhelmed. We are still coming through the peak, and this, as I have said before, is a delicate and dangerous moment in this crisis. So, I know that a lot of people have made a lot of sacrifices, which is why it is so important that we don’t let up now and risk undoing all of that hard work.So as we look to the future, our 5 tests remain key.First, we must continue to boost NHS capacity, preventing it from being overwhelmed.Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the number of deaths.Thirdly, we must see further reductions in the rate of infection to manageable levels, across all the relevant areas and settings.Fourth, we must be confident that the NHS will be able to cope with future demands, including as a result of any changes to existing measures or new measures we need to take.Fifth, and this is probably the most critical of all, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that could overwhelm the NHS.A second spike would be harmful to public health, resulting in many more deaths from COVID-19. That itself would lead to a second lockdown, inflicting further prolonged economic pain on the country. And, as the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said last week, that would not just be economically dangerous, it would inflict a serious blow to public confidence.This issue of a second spike and the need to avoid it – it’s not a theoretical risk, and it is not confined to the UK.Having relaxed restrictions in Germany over the past week, they have seen a rise in the transmission rate of coronavirus. And Chancellor Merkel has said publically, and she has made it clear, that they might need a second lockdown in Germany if the infection rate continues to rise.So, this risk is very real, and it is vital that we proceed carefully, guided by the scientific advice, so that our next step through this crisis is a sure-footed one.We mustn’t gamble away the sacrifices and progress we’ve made. We must continue to follow the scientific evidence, and we must continue to take the right decisions at the right moment in time.We are working on all of the potential options for a second phase. There is light at the end of the tunnel – whether you are an NHS worker on the front line working tirelessly shift after shift, or a parent at home with young children. But we need to be patient and careful as we come through this moment of maximum risk.So, we will wait for SAGE’s next review of the data in early May.We’re ramping up the testing, with capacity now at over 73,000 per day, and 52,429 tests carried out per day, and eligibility for those tests has now been expanded further, to include anybody who needs to go to work and can’t work remotely, and who has symptoms. It also includes anyone over 65 with symptoms and all care home residents, as well as care home staff.And at the same time as we ramp up the testing capacity, we’ll keep working on our tracking and tracing capability which will be a key component in the next phase of the crisis.We will continue to source ventilators and personal protective equipment at home and abroad.Paul Deighton is leading the national effort to increase domestic production and supply.We continue to source PPE from abroad setting ourselves out as the international buyer of choice. In the last 10 days, we have secured over 5 million masks from China, we’ve had three flights with gowns from Turkey – because we know that every single one of those items of PPE is needed by those working so hard on the front line, both in the NHS and also in our care homes.Our international effort is not confined to procurement.I can tell you we have also made huge progress in returning UK nationals, who otherwise would have been at risk of being stranded abroad. Since the outbreak in Wuhan, we have helped and estimated 1.3 million Britons return on commercial flights.And we have done that by working with the airlines and with those governments to make sure that the flights can run and that the airspace is kept open.And we have brought back over 200,000 Brits back from Spain, 50,000 back from Australia, and over 11,000 from Pakistan, to name but just 3 countries.As well as those commercial flights, we have also chartered flights, where commercial options weren’t possible, and we have now reached the stage where we have brought back over 20,000 British nationals on 99 flights from 21 countries and territories. That includes over 9,000 UK nationals back from India, 2,000 home from South Africa, and 1,200 from Peru.In terms of repatriations it is worth also just bearing in mind that on the 17th March, when we changed our travel advice for those travelling on cruise ships, there were something like 19,000 British passengers on 60 cruise ships sailing around the world.And as border restrictions were put in place by country after country, we faced a daunting task in getting our people home. But, we stuck at it, and 6 weeks later, we have now got all 19,000 British passengers back home safe and sound.That was an enormous effort, and we recognise that the job is not done yet. And we will continue this unprecedented effort, with further charter flights from New Zealand, Pakistan and Bangladesh, amongst others, over the next week or so. So, I must pay tribute to the outstanding work of the consular teams working night and day at the FCO in London and at our embassies and high commissions around the world.Finally, the Health Secretary announced last week that UK trials have started, as we draw on the incredible scientific talent we have in this country to pursue a vaccine.And that effort too has an international dimension to it.So, today, we announced that the UK will provide GAVI the international vaccine alliance with the equivalent of £330 million each year over the next 5 years as we seek to develop a vaccine both to protect the British people, but also to help immunise millions of the poorest and most vulnerable people around the world, combining the depth of our innovative know-how, with the big-hearted determination that has characterised our national effort to defeat the coronavirus.Find out more about coronavirus (COVID-19): what you need to do.

Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 28 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-28-april-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-04-28,"Coronavirus press conference: 28 April 2020Welcome once again to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.I’m joined today by Professor John Newton, our testing coordinator, and Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor Angela McLean.This morning, at 11 o’clock, we paused to remember the 85 NHS colleagues and 19 social care colleagues who have lost their lives with coronavirus.It was a moment of solemn reflection for so many of us and of unbearable sadness for some.They are the nation’s fallen heroes. And we will remember them.Every day we are working through our plan to protect life and protect the NHS, slowing the spread and building capacity, so that the NHS at all times can offer the very best care to everyone, because we’ve got the beds, the ventilators and the staff available.So far, thanks to the incredible work of NHS colleagues and the shared sacrifice of everyone watching at home, that plan is working.The latest figures show 3,260 spare critical care beds available across the NHS.On the most recent figures:there have been 763,387 tests for coronavirus so far in the UK, including 43,453 yesterday  161,145 people have tested positive: an increase of 3,996 cases since yesterday  15,796 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus  21,678 people have now sadly died in hospital, an increase of 586 since yesterdayThis morning, the Office for National Statistics and the CQC published more information on the overall impact, including that there have been 4,343 notified deaths in care homes since Easter.The proportion of coronavirus deaths in care homes is a sixth of the total, which is just below what we see in normal times.I want to make sure that we bring as much transparency as possible to important information like this, and so, from tomorrow, we will be publishing not just the number of deaths in hospitals each day but the number of deaths in care homes and the community too, something that was not previously possible.This will supplement the ONS and CQC weekly publications and all add to our understanding of how this virus is spreading day by day. And it will help the judgements that we will make as we work to keep people safe.Behind every single death is a family’s heartbreak, and we must do everything humanly possible to save as many lives as we can.We will not be changing the social distancing rules until our 5 tests have been met:the NHS protected  infection rates falling  the number of deaths falling substantially  the operational challenges around testing and PPE addressed  and with no risk of a second spikeI want to update you on 2 other issues of major importance.First, testing.At the start of this month, I set the goal of 100,000 tests a day.Every day, we’re ramping up this testing capacity, on track to meet that goal.We are continuously opening new drive-through centres. There are now 41, with 48 going live this week.For people who can’t get to the tests, we’re expanding home testing to bring the test to them. We are increasing the dispatch of home test kits from 5,000 a day last Friday to 25,000 a day by the end of this week.At the weekend, 17 mobile testing units, manned by the army, were operational. By the end of the week, we plan to have over 70 deployed, with trained crews across the country.All of this has led to an increase in daily testing capacity, which now stands at 73,400.And this has allowed us progressively to expand access to testing.We started with hospital patients, who have always had access to a test right the way through, ramping up to include symptomatic NHS and social care colleagues and their households, and then all essential workers.Today, because we’ve been able to expand capacity, I can expand access further.Building on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England and of patients and staff in the NHS.This means anyone who is working or living in a care home will be able to get access to a test, whether they have symptoms or not.I’m determined to do everything I can to protect the most vulnerable.And we now have capacity to go further.So, from now, we are making testing available to all over-65s and their households with symptoms, and to all workers who would have to leave home in order to go to work and members of their households who have symptoms, from construction workers to emergency plumbers, research scientists to those in manufacturing.This expansion of access to testing will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe. And it’s possible because we have expanded capacity for testing thus far.Next, I want to update you on our COVID-19 therapeutics work.This is research to understand whether existing drugs could be used to treat people more effectively once they’ve developed the disease.Currently no drugs in the world have been clinically proven to treat COVID-19.But our Therapeutics Taskforce has identified a number of promising candidates.Currently 6 different treatments have been entered into national clinical trials and the first is ready to enter the next stage: a new early phase clinical trial platform that we are launching today.This is a national effort made possible by government, academia and industry working together.In addition, we need to make the best possible use of all the medicines we have.We’re updating the guidelines for the use of medicines in care homes, removing a barrier so that, for the period of the pandemic, where it’s clinically appropriate, medicines that have been labelled for use by one patient can be used by another who needs them, instead of being destroyed. Clinicians and colleagues in social care have called for this change, which is already standard procedure in hospitals.Right across government, we are working day and night to defeat this virus:ramping up testing capacity  investigating new drugs and treatments  backing vaccine development  securing and distributing billions of items of PPE  getting the NHS whatever resources it needs to make sure that it is always there to treat everybody who needs itThe risk of a second peak is real, but as a nation we are holding it at bay, so please stick with it: stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 27 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-27-april-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-04-27,"Coronavirus press conference: 27 April 2020Welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.Before we start, I wanted to let you know that today’s briefing will follow a bit of a new format.Following significant demand, as well as questions from the media, we will take our first question from a member of the public.This is going to become a regular feature of these briefings. The questions are selected by an independent polling organisation and, just like the journalist’s questions, we don’t see the questions in advance.But we’ll give them the very best answers we can.In the past few hours, since we announced this new approach, we’ve had over 15,000 questions submitted. And you can ask a question yourself, by going to gov.uk/ask.Today, I’m joined by Professor Chris Whitty and Professor Stephen Powis, the NHS Medical Director.The government is working through our action plan, and at its core the objective is to protect life and to protect the NHS. Both by slowing the spread of the virus so we flatten the curve and by ensuring that the NHS always has more than enough capacity to provide critical care for all those who need it.According to the most recent figures, there have been 719,910 tests for coronavirus so far in the UK, including 37,024 yesterday. 157,149 people have tested positive. That’s an increase of 4,310 cases since yesterday. 15,051 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 15,239 yesterday. And, sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 21,092 have now died. That’s an increase of 360 fatalities.We must never lose sight of the human cost of coronavirus and the pain and the grief that it causes.And each death serves as a reminder that we must stand firm in our resolve.Sadly, these death figures include 82 NHS colleagues and 16 colleagues who work in social care.They dedicated their lives to caring for others. And I feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones.Today, I am able to announce that the government is setting up a Life Assurance Scheme for NHS and social care frontline colleagues.Families of staff who die from coronavirus in the course of their essential frontline work will receive a £60,000 payment.Of course, nothing replaces the loss of a loved one. But we want to do everything we can to support families who are dealing with this grief.And, as a government, we are looking closely at other professions that work on the frontline against coronavirus, who also do not have access to such schemes, to see where this may be required.This crisis has shown that this country values our health and care workers so much.And I want to pay tribute to the perseverance of the British public who, even this warm Spring weekend, in their vast majority, did the right thing and stayed home to protect the NHS.Thus far, in this crisis, at every single hour of every single day, the NHS has always had the capacity to treat the people who need that treatment.I’m glad to be able to report that there are now 3,190 spare critical care beds.Indeed, 42% of oxygen-supported beds in the NHS now lie empty.And, in most parts of the country, the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is beginning to fall.One of reasons NHS capacity has always exceeded need is because of our amazing programme of NHS Nightingale hospitals.Today, I was proud to attend, virtually, the opening of the 8th of our 10 Nightingale hospitals across the UK, again, built in a matter of weeks.This Nightingale Hospital project stands as a monument to this nation’s ability to get things done when it matters.This is one of the most ambitious projects this country has ever seen in peacetime and I’d like to thank the NHS, the armed forces and all the companies that have worked side by side to make these plans a reality.The Nightingale project is just one of the measures that’s boosted capacity all across the NHS.By re-enlisting thousands of former staff, former clinicians and enrolling early thousands of students, we’ve boosted the workforce of the NHS.And we have changed forever the digital capability of the NHS.I think many people who have now used online GP consultations and online outpatient visits won’t ever go back. And I pay tribute to the staff who have worked in different ways to how they would ever have imagined and who have been more flexible and open to change when it was really needed.So, where there have been advances amongst these huge challenges of this crisis, we must not lose them.However, we also know that fewer people are coming to the NHS when they need to.A&E attendances have dropped to 221,000 emergency department attendances in the last week, compared to 477,000 for the same week last year. That’s more than 50%.Now, some of this drop is due to lower road traffic and people following the social distancing rules.Some of it will be due to people accessing the NHS in ways that work better for them, like online or through pharmacies. And that’s a good thing.But, in some cases, we know that the drop is due to people not coming forward and using the NHS for critical things that matter.Our message is that the NHS is open. Help us to help you. So, if you’re worried about chest pains for instance, maybe you might be having a heart attack or a stroke, or you feel a lump and you’re worried about cancer, or you’re a parent concerned about your child, please come forward and seek help as you always would.It is so important that everybody uses the NHS responsibly.And the NHS will always be there for you when you need it. Just as it has been there for us all throughout this crisis, and throughout our lives.And, as the number of hospitalisations from coronavirus begins to fall, I can announce now that starting tomorrow we will begin the restoration of other NHS services, starting with the most urgent, like cancer care and mental health support.The exact pace of the restoration will be determined by local circumstances on the ground, according to local need and according to the amount of the coronavirus cases that the hospital is having to deal with.Having written off £13.4 billion worth of historic NHS debt during the coronavirus crisis, I want to ensure that the NHS is always there. In a way that doesn’t just help us to recover from coronavirus as a country, but also puts us in a stronger position for the future.We are coming through the peak.We will honour those who have dedicated their lives to caring for others. But, it will count for nothing if we let things slip now and risk a second peak.I know that the lockdown is hard for so many people. But, let us all have the resolve to see this through.So please stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."
Environment Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/environment-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-26-april-2020,Environment Secretary,2020-04-26,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 26 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 26 April 2020.Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference. I’m pleased to be joined today by Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England.Before I update you on the latest developments in the food supply chain, let me first give you an update on the latest data from the COBR coronavirus data file. Through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:669,850 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 29,058 tests carried out yesterday;  152,840 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 4,463 cases since yesterday;  15,953 people are currently in hospital with the coronavirus in the UK, down from 16,411 on 25 April.And sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 20,732 have now died. That is an increase of 413 fatalities since yesterday.We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of these victims.At the beginning of the outbreak of this virus we saw significant problems in panic buying. That episode quickly subsided and food availability now is back to normal levels and has been for several weeks. All supermarkets have introduced social distancing measures to protect both their staff and their customers and it is essential that shoppers respect these measures.The food supply chain has also seen a significant reduction in staff absence over recent weeks. As staff who had been self-isolating through suspected coronavirus symptoms have returned to work. So absence levels are down from a peak of typically 20% in food businesses three weeks ago to less than 10% at the end of last week and in some cases individual companies reporting absences as low as 6%.We have put in place measures to support the clinically vulnerable. So far 500,000 food parcels have been delivered to the shielded group, that is those who cannot leave home at all due to a clinical condition that they have. In addition, the major supermarkets have agreed to prioritise delivery slots for those in this shielded group. So far over 300,000 such deliveries have been made, enabling people to shop normally and choose the goods that they want to buy.We recognise that there are others who are not clinically vulnerable and therefore are not in that shielded group but who may also be in need of help. Perhaps through having a disability or another type of medical condition, or indeed, being unable to draw on family and neighbours to help them. We have been working with local authorities to ensure that those people can be allocated a volunteer shopper to help them get their food needs. Charities such as Age UK and others can now also make also direct referrals on the Good Samaritan App to locate volunteers for those in need.Many supermarkets have taken steps to increase the number of delivery slots that they have. At the beginning of this virus outbreak there were typically 2.1 million delivery slots in the entire supermarket chain. That has now increased to 2.6 million, and over the next couple of weeks we anticipate that that will grow further to 2.9 million. So supermarkets have taken steps to increase their capacity but while this capacity has expanded, it will still not be enough to meet all of the demand that is out there.Some supermarkets have already chosen to prioritise some vulnerable customers with a proportion of the delivers slots that they have and others have offered to work with us and also local authorities to help establish a referral system so that when somebody is in desperate need, a local authority is able to make a referral to make sure that they can get a priority slot.As we look forward more generally towards the next stage in our battle against this virus, there are encouraging signs of progress, but before we consider it safe to adjust any of the current social distancing measures, we must be satisfied that we have met the five tests set out last week by the First Secretary.Those tests mean that the NHS can continue to cope;    that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently;        that the rate of infection is decreasing; and operational challenges have been met;        and, most important of all, that there is no risk of a second peak.  For now, the most important thing we can all do to stop the spread of the coronavirus is to stay at home, to protect the NHS and save lives.I want to pay tribute to all those who are working throughout the food supply chain from farmers, manufacturers and retailers. The response of this industry to ensure that we have the food that we need has been truly phenomenal.Thank you."
Home Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 25 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/home-secretary-delivers-daily-coronavirus-update-25-april-2020,Home Secretary,2020-04-25,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 25 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 25 April 2020.Good afternoon, welcome back to Downing Street for the government’s daily press conference on coronavirus.Today I am joined by Lynne Owens, Director General of the National Crime Agency, and by Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England.The government’s step-by-step plan has always been to slow the spread of this disease, increasing the capacity of our world-class hospitals so that they can cope.And your hard work has helped us to do this.Our instruction remain clear.People should stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Through our ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of 9am today, I can report that:    six hundred and forty thousand, seven hundred and ninety-two tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including twenty-eight thousand seven hundred and sixty tests yesterday        one hundred and forty-eight thousand, three hundred and seventy-seven people have tested positive, that’s an increase of four thousand nine hundred and thirteen cases since yesterday        sixteen thousand, four hundred and eleven people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down from seventeen thousand and forty-nine yesterday        and sadly, of those in hospital with the virus, twenty thousand three hundred and nineteen have died - that’s an increase of eight hundred and thirteen fatalities since yesterday  As the deaths caused by this terrible virus pass another tragic and terrible milestone, the entire nation is grieving.My deepest sympathies and condolences go to those who have lost loved ones.And, I would like to pay tribute to the selfless frontline workers who have been struck down by this virus.Their exceptional public service and sacrifice will not be forgotten.The last time I was here, I spoke about the impact of this national emergency on crime – and the tough but necessary measures to tackle it.I announced enhanced support for victims of domestic abuse, many of whom are particularly vulnerable and exposed.Our You Are Not Alone campaign - to signpost the help available and to make it clear to victims they can still leave home - has made an incredible impact, with 98 million online impressions.Now, I refuse to ignore the amplified risk for the victims of hidden crime, and I – along with Lynne, and across our law enforcement agencies – refuse to allow criminals to take advantage of these unprecedented times.Now, provisional data from police shows a fall in overall crime during this coronavirus outbreak.Car crime, burglary and shoplifting are all lower than in the same period from this time last year.But we also know that the most sophisticated criminals continue to exploit and capitalise on this horrendous crisis.So today, I have a message for them: our world-class law enforcement is also adapting, and they are onto you.And their efforts are paying off.Last week, Border Force found one million pounds’ worth of cocaine set to be smuggled into the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel, hidden in boxes of face masks.The NCA (National Crime Agency) has taken down multiple websites running phishing scams and selling bogus PPE.Last week they arrested 2 people suspected of trying to sell unregistered coronavirus testing kits.The NCA have alerted the police to thirteen hundred potential child sexual abuse cases.They have made arrests and safeguarded children.This is a sickening reminder of the frightening activity that is targeted towards our children every single day.International action to crush criminal gangs and to shut drug supply lines continues, and the National Crime Agency helped to seize 700 kilograms of heroin in Pakistan, potentially bound for the United Kingdom.Reported losses for coronavirus fraud now stands at £2.4 million,  and I would like to thank the major banks and UK Finance who are working with us to protect vulnerable people from becoming victims of crime.And, our outstanding frontline police officers and their staff continue to do an exceptional job in keeping our streets safe.They are still responding to all types of crime.That includes some extraordinary dangerous driving, with a minority of drivers using quieter roads as their own personal race track and endangering people’s lives.We have seen speeds of up to one hundred and fifty one miles per hour clocked on the M1, and one hundred and thirty four miles per hour in a 40 miles per hour zone in London.Police and fire staff continue to put their arms around people and communities: by taking people shopping and taking prescriptions to the elderly, driving ambulances and supporting those in need throughout this difficult times.I am immensely grateful to each and every one of our emergency service heroes.And I would also like to take this particular opportunity to pay tribute to the South Yorkshire Police motorcyclist tragically killed as he responded to an emergency earlier this week.My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and colleagues at this truly heart-breaking time.His death shows how our exceptional police put their own lives at risk every day to protect the people that they serve.Coronavirus merely highlights the extent of their courage, their compassion and their commitment.Police officers and staff continue to put themselves at risk to ensure that people follow the life-saving instruction to stay at home.Now, staying at home for almost 5 weeks has changed the way in which we are living our lives, and I know how tough this has been.Huge sacrifices have been made: jobs have been lost; to people’s futures have been put on hold, weddings have been cancelled, families have been unable to see one another.Every single person across our United Kingdom has given up a great deal.From the vulnerable, the elderly, those self-isolating alone, to the hundreds of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses, to the children and young people whose education has been put on hold.This extraordinary national effort has been quite remarkable and I am grateful to everybody for playing their part.But we should not lose sight of the fact this country’s efforts are working.So my thanks go to the British people.You have fostered a spirit of national unity that is helping us to get through this challenging time.The action we are collectively taking is working, and your sacrifices are undoubtedly saving lives.We know that people are frustrated, but we are not out of danger yet.It is imperative that people continue to follow the rules designed to protect their families, their friends and their loved ones. This will continue to save lives.We all want to return to living our lives as normally as possible, and, of course, as soon and as safely as we can – and that’s what the entire government is working towards.But the five tests we have laid out must be met before we can ease these life-saving restrictions.We must be sure that we can continue to protect the NHS.That there is a sustained and consistent fall in the daily rates of death.That the data shows the rate of infection decreases.That the operational challenges are met.And of course, that there is no risk of a second peak of infections.Until then, we all have a role to play in pulling our country out of this crisis.So, I urge you all to stay strong and embrace that spirit of national unity by continuing to follow the advice: to stay at home, to protect the NHS and save lives."
Transport Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 24 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/secretary-of-state-for-transport-delivers-daily-coronavirus-update-24-april-2020,Transport Secretary,2020-04-24,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 24 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 24 April 2020.Opening remarksGood afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.I’m pleased to be joined today by Dr Jenny Harries.Latest dataBefore I talk about the latest steps we are taking to defeat coronavirus, let me update you on the latest information from the COBR data file.I can report that through the government’s monitoring and testing programme, as of today (24 April 2020)612,031 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 28,532 tests yesterday  143,464 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 5,386 cases since yesterday  17,049 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down from 17,615 on 22 April and down 10% on last week  and sadly, of those in hospital with the virus, 19,506 have now died - that’s an increase of 684 fatalities since yesterdayWe express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of these victims.We must not forget that each of these statistics represents a personal tragedy.Transport importanceDespite the continued challenges ahead, as we prepare for the next stage in our battle to beat this pandemic, there are tentative signs we are making progress.The main reason for that is the way Britain has responded to the guidance to stay at home and maintain social distancing over the past few weeks.By respecting these measures, the whole country is slowing the spread of the virus.And by avoiding public transport, you’re freeing up space for critical workers who rely on buses and trains to travel safely.The continued operation of both passenger and freight transport is critically important to our resilience as a country.So today I’m announcing a new package of measures to ensure transport boosts our national response to COVID-19.FreightFirst, we’re announcing a far-reaching package to safeguard the flow of essential goods into – and across – the country.I can announce the government has secured a trilateral agreement along with the French and Irish governments which commits our nations to keeping freight routes open throughout the crisis…Bringing in life-saving medicines, food and many other essential goods…..Allowing us to meet the needs of our countries during this difficult time.Operators on many of these routes have been under rising financial pressures due to falling demand.Since many of them bring in crucial goods like medicines, raw materials and chemicals to purify water, it is important to guarantee the continuation of services.So, we’re protecting ferry routes between Great Britain and Northern Ireland with funding of up to £17 million.We’re also taking action to secure services around the United Kingdom, including up to £10.5 million for links to the Isle of Wight and the Scilly Isles, allowing critical freight to continue to support families in every part of our country.And we’re making sure that air links to Belfast and Derry-Londonderry in Northern Ireland will also continue – these routes are particularly important for critical workers.Thanks to the measures I’ve announced today, we are safeguarding 5 ferry and 2 air routes between Great Britain and Northern Ireland; and 26 different freight routes between Britain, France, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden.Transport Support UnitSecond, we have launched a Transport Support Unit (TSU) dedicated to fighting this pandemic.At the beginning of this crisis we reduced services like rail and buses, whilst securing their continuation to enable critical workers and others to make essential journeys.Lower ridership means we have spare transport capacity which I have directed to be used for logistical tasks in the fight against this virus.By making use of the people and the resources of the Department for Transport, its agencies and arm’s length bodies, we will be helping NHS trusts and local resilience groups to fight the pandemic.We now have over 8,500 specialist volunteers from across the transport sector.And around 9,000 vehicles which can support the national effort.This includes 4 fixed-wing aircraft owned by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (one of them a Boeing 737), helicopters, ships and trains.Together they will help move emergency patients and medical supplies, deliver personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals, and distribute food parcels to vulnerable people.And vehicles from Highways England will act as mobile COVID-19 testing centres.Network Rail is also making available its 7 regional distribution centres which can be used to support the effort.This work is underway and I would like to thank all those taking part, like the Network Rail engineers who helped fit out the Nightingale hospital in Manchester.As the country works hard to beat this virus, it’s vital we come together and help each other.So, the Transport Support Unit is getting to work, helping frontline staff, and making full use of the significant resources at its disposal.DronesI have also given the green light to trials of drones delivering medical supplies.Earlier this year, we awarded £28 million to Southampton and Portsmouth to develop a Future Transport Zone.As part of that initiative, £8 million was earmarked for testing drones, and how they might be used for delivering goods in the years and decades ahead.Of course, now we have an urgent need, so we’re making use of that testing programme as part of our response to COVID-19.As a result, I have fast-tracked trials to begin next week to carry medical supplies and equipment to St Mary’s Hospital, near Newport on the Isle of Wight.TramsFinally, we have made funding available today to keep England’s trams operating.This will keep open 5 light rail networks in Greater Manchester, Sheffield, Nottingham, West Midlands and Tyne and Wear….Allowing essential local routes to remain open.Once again ensuring that critical workers can travel during this crisis.Transport workersAll these new initiatives build on the very considerable work we’ve seen across transport since this crisis began.The government has taken widespread action to support the industry.For example, we’ve stepped in to keep trains operating…And to keep buses running.We’ve worked with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and airlines to bring thousands of Britons home from abroad.As of today, I can also confirm there are no British holidaymakers left stranded on cruise ships anywhere in the world.To help motorists we’ve waived MOT renewals until the end of the outbreak, ensuring that vulnerable people are able to stay at home without the worry.But I want to pay particular tribute to the transport critical workers who have gone above and beyond to keep vital freight and passenger services running…To keep hospitals and chemists supplied with medical goods…To ensure supermarkets are stocked with fresh food…And to maintain deliveries of essential energy and fuel supplies.From hauliers and train drivers to those keeping our ports and airports open.Each and every one of us depends on the transport lifeline they provide.They are part of the army of critical workers helping to fight this terrible scourge.Five testsBut before we consider it safe to amend the guidance, we must be satisfied we have met the 5 tests set by the First Secretary.To ensure….That the NHS can continue to cope  That the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently  That the rate of infection is falling  That the operational challenges have been met  And, most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peakConcluding remarksWe don’t yet know when that day will come, but I do know it will arrive sooner if motorists and others continue to only make essential journeys.The actions I’ve announced today will ensure that transport can continue to serve the nation during this crisis…..Keep us supplied with everything we need to stay at home.Yet also ensure that the infrastructure required to emerge from this pandemic stands-ready to serve us all when the time comes."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-23-april-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-04-23,"Coronavirus press conference: 23 April 2020Welcome back to Downing Street for today’s daily coronavirus briefing.I’m joined by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, and Professor John Newton, who is co-ordinating our work on testing.The government is working through our action plan, which has as its core that we must protect life and protect the NHS, both by slowing the spread of the virus so that we flatten the curve and by ensuring that the NHS is always there to treat all people who need its care.According to the most recent figures, 583,496 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 23,560 tests carried out yesterday. 138,078 people have tested positive for the virus, that’s an increase of 4,583 cases since yesterday. 17,615 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 18,189 on 21 April. And sadly, of those hospitalised, 18,738 have now died. And that is an increase of 616 fatalities since yesterday.And although this number is lower than it has been in previous days, I stop and think of each one. They will not be forgotten and their stories will live on.We must maintain our resolve and follow the social distancing rules. Because they are working. They are protecting the NHS. And they are saving lives.To lift the measures too soon, and to risk a second peak, would be a mistake. It would undo all of the hard work that’s been done and it would be bad for our nation’s health and for our nation’s economy.We can only start to change the measures:when the NHS can continue to cope  when the operational challenges have been met  when the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently  when the rate of infection is decreasing  and, most importantly, when there’s no risk of a second peakWe need to bring the incidence of new infection right down. We’ll then use a rigorous programme of test, track and trace and keep it down, so we can safely release more of the restrictions.And, today, I want to set out our progress on test, track and trace, which is such an important part of the measures that we’re taking and the work we’re doing.First, testing. We set the goal of 100,000 tests a day by the end of this month. I knew when we set it that this was a challenging target.Capacity is now ahead of our plans – and even overnight has increased from 40,000 to 51,000. And, because capacity has increased so substantially, we are now able to expand who can get the tests.Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test. But, of course, we had to start by prioritising patients in hospital, followed by NHS and social care colleagues and by those in care homes.As we expanded the capacity from just 2,000 tests a day at the start of March, to 10,000 tests a day at the start of this month, so we have been able to further expand access.Today I can go further. We make it easier, faster and simpler for any essential worker in England who needs a test to get a test.From today, employers of essential workers will be able to go on GOV.UK to get a test for any of their staff who need a test. And, from tomorrow, any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on GOV.UK themselves directly. This all applies for people in essential workers’ households too who need a test.It’s all part of getting Britain back on her feet.Those included as essential workers will be based on the list for schools and education, set out on GOV.UK. The whole process will be free. And, once you’ve entered your details on the website, you’ll get a text or an email inviting you to book an appointment.After you’ve had your test, results will be sent out by text and a helpdesk will be available to deal with queries. People who can’t go online can still apply through their employer.I want to make it as easy as possible for people to get a test, not least because we’re talking about people who are ill.Our network of regional test sites has now reached over 30 locations right across the UK, and more are being set up each day.And I want to just take this moment to applaud the private companies who have been involved, as well as my team at Public Health England and the NHS: Boots, Amazon, ThermoFisher, Randox, Roche, Oxford Nanopore, GSK and AstraZeneca. They’ve really stepped up to the mark, and I’m grateful to each and every one of them.We are also introducing home test kits. And, with the support of the armed forces, mobile testing sites too. The armed forces and the MoD have played a vital role here and I’d like to pay tribute to their work.I thought, at yesterday’s briefing, General Sir Nick Carter when he said that coronavirus had presented the single greatest logistical challenge in his 40 years of service, I thought that spoke a truth. Our armed forces have played their part in rising to this challenge and want to thank them all.In addition to testing essential workers, we are using testing to find out how many people have coronavirus. And how many people have had coronavirus.These are critical pieces of information to inform our battle against this novel virus, and that we’ll use to learn, and we keep learning about every day.This week we have begun one of the biggest virus infection and antibody studies that this country has ever seen.This is a joint project, with the Office for National Statistics bringing their experience of running large household surveys and the University of Oxford bringing their world leading scientific expertise.In total, 25,000 people will take part in the first phase, with plans to expand it to up to around 300,000 people over the next 12 months. Participants will provide regular samples taken from self-administered swabs and answer a few short questions during home visits by trained health workers.We will use these tests to help us strengthen our scientific understanding and inform us all on the big choices we have to make about social distancing measures and how we start returning to a more normal life.Letters are arriving on doorsteps from today. Please, if you’re asked, take part in this vital research for your country. The early signs from today are that there is huge enthusiasm from those who have received letters taking part in the survey. If you get a letter, please respond to it as soon as you can because you will be doing your bit.And, as we ramp up our ability to test in large numbers, and as we slow the spread of the virus, we also need to make sure we’ve got the ability to trace contacts just as effectively.As we look ahead, this is critical to keep the virus under control. And so we are putting the infrastructure in place now so we can roll out contact tracing on a large scale.We are currently testing the new NHS contact tracing app. If you become unwell with symptoms of coronavirus, you’ll be able to tell the NHS via this app. The app will then send an alert to other app users that you’ve been in significant contact with in recent days, even before you had the symptoms. So that they know and they can act accordingly, so we can get tests to people even if they are asymptomatic.If we are worried that they have been in significant contact with someone who has the disease, we’ll be able to let them know.But it’s not just about the technology. We need the people too. We need to be really kick-starting contact tracing, as the number of cases begin to fall.We are preparing for this now, by hiring an initial 18,000 people. Including over 3,000 clinicians, including public health specialists. We will be training up the mass ranks of our contact tracers over the coming weeks, and then roll out the service.This test, track and trace will be vital to stop a second peak of the virus.But recent weeks have shown that there’s something we can all do. And that is to follow the rules on social distancing.I am acutely aware of how difficult this has been, and especially as we enter Ramadan – a month that is so special for so many people.And this Ramadan, so many Muslims who serve our country in the NHS, and in the armed forces, and in so many other ways, will not be sharing the joy of this month as they normally do.I want to say to all British Muslims, thank you for staying at home. I know how important the daily iftar is. How important communal prayers are at night. And how important the Eid festival is.Thank you for making major changes to these vital parts of your practice. And I want to say to you all – Ramadan Mubarak. And thank you for your service and citizenship. And thank you for your sacrifice.This will help so we can, together, emerge from this challenge all the more united, all the more grateful to one another and all the more safe.We have travelled together too far to go backwards now.So please stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."
Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-april-2020,Foreign Secretary,2020-04-22,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 22 April:Coronavirus press conference 22 April 2020.Welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference.I’m pleased to be joined by Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and also our Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Nicholas Carter.Before CDS talks through the fantastic work that our brilliant armed forces have been doing during this crisis, let me give you an update you on the latest data from the COBR coronavirus data file.I can report that through the Government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:559,935 people have now been tested for the virus.133,495 have tested positive.Of those who have contracted the virus, 18,100 have very sadly died.We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of these victims and my heart goes out to every single one of those who have lost a loved one throughout this crisis.As a Government, we continue to take the steps necessary to slow the spread of this virus.The social distancing measures that people have overwhelmingly adhered to have meant that fewer people have needed hospital treatment.That has protected our NHS capacity as we continue through the peak of this virus and it has undoubtedly helped to save lives.At every point in this crisis, we have considered the scientific and the medical evidence that we have received very carefully.And we have been  deliberate in our actions so that we take the right steps at the right time.Now I know it has been tough going for businesses, for families and for vulnerable members of our communities up and down the country.It’s been a physical strain as we adapt to living and working at home while not seeing our family and our friends in the usual way we’d like to.It’s been an economic strain as businesses have had to furlough staff which is why the Chancellor launched the various business support measures to help see businesses and workers through these difficult times.But it has also been an immense mental strain on everyone: people stuck at home, families worried about their finances and the elderly more isolated than we’d ever want them to be.We’re making progress through the peak of this virus, but we’re not out of the woods yet as SAGE advised last week.That’s why the measures we introduced must remain in place for the time being.The greatest risk for us now, if we eased up on our social distancing rules too soon, is that we would risk a second spike in the virus with all the threats to life that would bring, and then the risk of a second lockdown which would prolong the economic pain that we’re going through.That was a point that Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, also made earlier on today.So with that in mind, last Thursday, I set out the five principles that will guide our approach going forward to the next phase, and which must be satisfied before we are willing and in a position to make any changes, which will of course be based on the advice that we receive form SAGE.That way we will ensure that our path out of this crisis is sure-footed, protecting both the public’s health but also our economy.If we stick to our plan, if take the right steps at the right time, we can get through this crisis, and I know we will.There’s no hiding the scale of this tragedy.But even in our darkest moments, the crisis has also shone a light on the best amongst us.The nation has come together to applaud our heroic NHS staff, our carers every week, and we pay tribute to their dedication and their professionalism and care with which they look after those who have fallen sick.With General Carter here, today, I think it is only fitting to pay tribute to the amazing work of our fantastic armed forces and the whole MoD led by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace.They have been there every step of the way, helping us to build the new NHS Nightingale hospitals to reinforce our critical care capacity. Supporting our Local Resilience Forums in delivering Personal Protective Equipment where it’s needed most.And helping also deliver the mobile labs which are critical to ramping up of testing capacity right across the country.As a result of those efforts and that team work, hospitals have been able to treat more patients, as result they save more lives and we have ensured that the peak of this virus has not overwhelmed the NHS.And, today, our armed forces are again part of that team as we announce two new deployments to the NHS Nightingale facilities in Harrogate and Bristol.Across the UK, this extra hospital capacity which itself comes on top of the 33,000 additional beds we’ve managed to free up across the NHS.That is the equivalent of building an extra 50 district general hospitals. And as I said, that has safeguarded the capacity in our hospitals to care both for coronavirus patients but also make sure other people get the urgent care or the emergency treatment they need.People used to joke in this country that you could never build a hospital that quickly.Well, we didn’t just build one, we built seven and we thank our armed forces for helping to make that happen.And, you know, for many countries around the world, including modern democracies, the sight of their military on the streets in a national emergency could be a cause for concern or even trepidation.But for the British people, the sight of our armed forces working side by side with our brilliant NHS staff offers a calm reassurance that the task is at hand, that we will come through this crisis.Now I make no bones about it.There have been challenges, there still are challenges.We’re not there yet.We continue to ramp up the testing capacity, which will play a really important role in the next phase of the crisis.Amidst a global shortage in Personal Protective Equipment, we’ve distributed over a billion items to the front line, where its needed most.We’ve just brought in Lord Deighton who helped organise the London Olympics to boost our domestic supply even further.And I am on the phone every day pursuing the next batch of deliveries from abroad with the support of our tireless diplomatic service. The first of several new deliveries landed from Turkey in the early hours of this morning.We will only come through this global pandemic, if we come together as a nation, and if we bring other countries around the world together so that we can rise to this international challenge.As we work with our partners abroad to get the PPE we need, to get the ventilators we need to pursue a vaccine for this terrible virus, we’re also working night and day to return stranded British nationals from all four corners of the world.We’ve kept airports open and airlines running to bring over a million Brits home on commercial flights. A massive endeavour.On top of that, at the FCO, we set up a £75 million special charter arrangement with the airlines and that’s already brought home over thirteen thousand people back on 63 flights from more than a dozen countries.And, we’re organising more charter flights in the days ahead from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.So at home and abroad, we’re meeting the whole range of challenges that coronavirus presents.And if we stick together, and if we stay the course, we will defeat this virus for good.Find out more about coronavirus (COVID-19): what you need to do.

Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 21 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-21-april-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-04-21,"Coronavirus press conference: 21 April 2020Good afternoon and welcome to the Downing Street coronavirus daily briefing. I’m joined by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Professor Van Tam, and by Professor John Newton.At the heart of our plan is ensuring that NHS capacity is always ahead of need. This means that if you or someone you love needs hospital care with COVID-19 then you will get that care.And if, God forbid, you needed to go into an intensive care unit, then you will have the bed and the life-saving equipment and team you need.The latest figures show another record high of 2,963 spare critical care beds available across the NHS.We said at the start of this that our primary goal in our battle plan was to slow the spread and protect the NHS, by flattening the curve and by increasing capacity.That plan is working.At no point in this crisis has anyone who could benefit from critical care been denied that care because there weren’t enough staff or beds or ventilators to treat them.But there is much further to go.On the most recent figures, 535,342 tests have now been carried out in the UK, excluding Northern Ireland. Of these, 129,044 people have tested positive. The number of patients in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms is now down to 17,681. 17,366 people have now, sadly, died in hospital, which is an increase of 852. This number is another salutary lesson and it tells us of the deadly nature of this virus.We owe it to them – and to ourselves – not to throw away the progress we’ve made so far.We have been clear that we will not risk lives by relaxing the social distancing rules before our 5 tests have been met:first, that the NHS can continue to cope  second, that the operational challenges have been met  third, that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently  fourth, that the rate of infection is decreasing  and, most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peakI want to update you on 2 specific areas of huge importance.First, PPE.PPE delivery is an operation of unprecedented scale and complexity.Since the start of this crisis, we have now delivered over a billion items of PPE.We are constantly working to improve that delivery system, buying PPE from around the world, and working to make more at home.We have a diverse range of suppliers and are working day and night to expand that supply base.We are in direct talks with the factories that produce PPE and the fabric that it’s made of. This has proved one of the most fruitful avenues and I want to especially thank my Foreign Office and DIT colleagues, especially in China, for their incredible work making these connections.I also want to thank the enormous response we’ve had from our appeal for companies to come forward to help replenish the stocks.As of yesterday, we have had 8,331 offers of PPE equipment and we are investigating each and every one of those many leads.Of course, some of these leads have led to very large-scale purchases of many millions of items. But, the reality is that not everyone who approaches us can deliver on their offers in scale.I’m very grateful to all those who have come forward.We are actively engaged with over 1,000 companies, and I can announce that we are working with 159 potential UK manufacturers, which are starting to come on stream.I have said many times how determined I am to get people the PPE they need. This is a 24/7 operation. It’s one of the biggest cross-government operations I’ve ever seen.I’m grateful to colleagues from the NHS, from Public Health England, the Crown Commercial Service, Cabinet Office, the Communities Department, the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces, the devolved administrations and territorial offices, the Business Department, the Treasury, the Foreign Office and the Department for International Trade for their enormous hard work on this.And I’m very grateful to Lord Deighton, who delivered the Olympics, for stepping forward to lead this national effort, and deliver once again for his country.The second area is vaccines.In the long run, the best way to defeat coronavirus is through a vaccine. After all, this is a new disease, this is uncertain science, but I am certain that we will throw everything we’ve got at developing a vaccine.The UK is at the forefront of the global effort. We have put more money than any other country into the global search.For all the efforts around the world, 2 of the leading vaccine developments are taking place here at home at Oxford and Imperial. Both these promising projects are making rapid progress, and I’ve told the scientists leading them that we will do everything in our power to support.First, I am today making £22.5 million available to the Imperial team project to support their phase 2 clinical trials, which will assess a sample of several thousand, and for them to begin the work on a subsequently very large-scale phase 3 trial.Second, I am today making available £20 million to the Oxford team to fund their clinical trials.The team have accelerated the trials process, working with the regulator the MHRA, who have been absolutely brilliant, and as a result I can announce that the vaccine from the Oxford trial will be trialled in people from this Thursday.In normal times, reaching this stage would take years and I’m very proud of the work taken so far.At the same time, we will invest in manufacturing capability so that, if either of these vaccines safely work, then we can make it available for the British people as soon as humanly possible.Nothing about this process is certain.Vaccine development is a process of trial and error and trial again. That’s the nature of how vaccines are developed.But I’ve told Sarah Gilbert and Robin Shattock, 2 of our most inspiring scientists, that we are going to back them to the hilt and give them every resource they need to get the best possible chance of success, as soon as possible.After all, the upside benefit of being the first country to develop a successful vaccine is so huge that I am throwing everything at it.Coronavirus is a powerful enemy, but I believe the power of human ingenuity is stronger. Every day the science gets better and we gather more information, we understand more about how to defeat this virus.But, in the meantime, the most important thing everyone watching this can do is to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."
Chancellor's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 20 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/chancellor-delivers-daily-coronavirus-update-20-april-2020,Chancellor,2020-04-20,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 20 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 20 April 2020.Good evening from Downing Street, where I’m joined by Professor Angela McLean, Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser, and Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England.Before I provide an update on the economic situation, let me start by addressing the issue uppermost on people’s minds – personal protective equipment, or PPE.This is an international challenge that many other countries are experiencing.Alongside the efforts of British businesses and our embassies around the world, we are working hard to get the PPE our frontline NHS and social care staff need.We have appointed Paul Deighton, formerly Chief Executive of London 2012 Olympics, to lead on our domestic efforts to make an increase the supply of PPE.And we are receiving shipments of PPE regularly from suppliers in the UK and abroad.We’re working to resolve the Turkish shipment of PPE as soon as possible, following some unexpected delays at the weekend.Today, we have unloaded a shipment of 140,000 gowns from Myanmar.And we are, of course, continuing to pursue every possible option for PPE procurement.Let me turn now to the economic situation.Exactly a month ago today I stood at this lectern and said we would step in and help pay to people’s wages.We promised this support would be available by the end of April – today, we deliver our promise.HMRC opened the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme at 8 o’clock this morning.As of 4 o’clock this afternoon, over 140,000 firms have applied…and the grants they’ll receive will help pay the wages of more than a million people……a million people who, if they hadn’t been furloughed, would have been at risk of losing their job.Firms applying today should receive their cash in six working days. HMRC will continue to provide updates on the number of people furloughed.And let me put on record my thanks to the thousands of staff at HMT and HMRC who have made this happen.People have come out of retirement, put aside their normal duties, and worked around the clock, from their kitchen tables and spare rooms, to get this new system up and running.This remarkable story of public service reminds us how many different people are playing a role in this crisis – and I’m very grateful to all of them, for everything they’ve done.It’s important to be clear why we have introduced the CJRS, and the other schemes we’ve put in place to support the self-employed and businesses.We’ve never seen an economic crisis like this one.Times like this demand that we put aside ideology and orthodoxy.Times like this demand that the state turns to its most immediate purpose: the protection and support of its people.The goal of the new schemes we’ve developed is to maintain as many people as possible in their existing jobs;to support viable businesses to stay afloat;and to protect the incomes of the self-employed to allow them to trade again.To maintain, in other words, our economy’s productive capacity so that we can bridge through this crisis.That is what we have done – and the Office for Budget Responsibility said last week that the situation would have been much worse if it hadn’t been for our actions.But in everything we have done, even in our defence against the immediate crisis, we have also been sowing the seeds of our ultimate recovery.As we look ahead and start to plan for our recovery, it is critical we don’t just maintain companies and jobs that already exist……but that we also encourage the businesses, jobs and technologies of the future.Innovation and entrepreneurship have powered growth in our country for centuries; and it is what will drive our growth as we recover from this crisis.To that end, earlier today, I launched two initiatives to support the most innovative firms in the county, worth £1.25 billion.First, we are launching a new Future Fund worth £500 million, to make sure that high growth companies across the UK can continue to access the investment they need during the crisis.Launching in May, the Future Fund will provide UK-based early stage companies with convertible loans between £125,000 and £5 million.Our Future Fund will match investments made by private investors in early stage businesses, on terms that protect the UK taxpayer.Second, alongside the new Future Fund, the Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, has worked closely with Innovate UK – our national innovation agency……to provide £750 million of grant and loan funding for tens of thousands of highly innovative firms……in every sector, and every region and nation of the UK.He, like I, believes strongly in the role of innovation and enterprise in recovering our economy.As I said last week, right now, the most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people.We must continue to slow the spread of the virus;to make sure fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time;and protect the NHS’s ability to cope.Today, the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme reports:501,379 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out, including 19,316 tests carried out yesterday  124,743 people have tested positive, an increase of 4,676 cases since yesterday  17,971 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK  and sadly, of those who have been hospitalised, 16,509 have now died - an increase of 449 fatalities since yesterdayOur thoughts are with the families and friends of all those who have lost their lives.As we look forward, towards the next stage in our battle against this disease, there are encouraging signs we have been making progress.But before we consider it safe to adjust any of the current social distancing measures, we must be satisfied that we have met the five tests set out last week by the First Secretary.Those tests mean that the NHS can continue to cope;that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently;that the rate of infection is decreasing; that the operational challenges have been met;and, most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peak.So I want to thank each and every person across the UK who is following the government’s advice to stay at home, protect our NHS and, ultimately, save lives.Thank you.Let me now hand over to Angela before taking questions from the media."
Education Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 19 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/gavin-williamson-speech-on-covid-19-response,Education Secretary,2020-04-19,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 19 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 19 April 2020.I’d like to welcome you to today’s briefing from Downing Street.I am joined by Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, who will be sharing with you the latest detailed data on coronavirus.On any normal Sunday afternoon, many of you would have been out with your family and friends enjoying the sunshine. And tomorrow, many children would be going to school for the first time after a two-week break.But these are not normal times and we are asking you to stay at home, so can I start by thanking you for all the sacrifices that you’ve already had to make and that you continue to make.I know this has not been easy. But it’s the surest way that we have to protect the NHS and to save lives.I can report, through the Government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today 482,063 tests for coronavirus have been carried out in Great Britain, including 21,626 test carried out yesterday.120,067 people have tested positive - that’s an increase of 5,850 cases since yesterday. 18,118 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, compared to 18,006 on 17 April.And sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 16,060 have now died. That’s an increase of 596 fatalities since yesterday.We mustn’t forget that behind every single statistic there is a heart-breaking story and my sincere condolences go out to everyone has lost someone that they love.These are challenging times for all of us and each of us has a role to play in fighting this virus. Those who are working in the NHS, those doctors, nurses, porters, cleaners and ambulance crews. They’re all doing an amazing job and are truly heroic in the part they are playing in supporting every one of us in this nation.But today I would also like to say how enormously grateful we are to those who are working in our nurseries, schools colleges, universities and children’s services.I am profoundly grateful for the vital role they are providing in our communities.They have been keeping schools and nurseries open – including over the Easter holidays - so that our most vulnerable children and children of critical workers can continue to be supported and they can be cared for.People are anxious to know when we are going to relax restrictions and when schools are likely to be fully back and open again. Of course, I want nothing more than to get schools back to normal, make sure that children are sat around learning and experiencing the joy of being at school.But I can’t give you a date, because before we do, we need to meet five tests.First, we must protect the NHS’s ability to cope and be sure that it can continue to provide critical care and specialist treatment right across the whole of the UK.Second, we need to see the daily death rates from coronavirus coming down.Third, we need to have reliable data that shows the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels.Fourth, we need to be confident that testing capacity and PPE are being managed, with supply able to meet not just today’s demand, but future demand.And, fifth, and perhaps most crucially, we need to be confident any changes we do make will not risk a second peak of infections.When we can be sure we have met these five essential points, we can think about getting children into schools again - learning, mastering new ideas and being with their friends once more.We will work with the sector to consider how best to reopen schools, nurseries and colleges when the time is right.Our first priority has always been protecting the wellbeing of children and young people, but particularly those vulnerable young people with special educational needs or a social worker.Schools are open for them and we’re working to make sure those who should attend do so.Places are available for children of critical workers too. With up to 130,000 children in school every single day, schools are helping keep the country moving.And we are asking our local authorities and schools to ensure every vulnerable child knows that their school is there to support them, that systems are in place to keep in touch with those children who are unable to attend because of health reasons.I know that families of seriously ill and disabled children are particularly worried at this time and I’m grateful to all staff who are working so hard to support their education, health and care – particularly those in special schools and residential care homes.Young people who have left care or are just about to, whether that’s from a foster family or residential care, are really vulnerable right now. So I am asking local authorities to ensure that no one has to leave care during this difficult time.The £1.6 billion of additional funding announced yesterday will help local authorities give care leavers, and other vulnerable groups, the support that they need at this difficult time.To further protect children from harm, we are continuing to support Childline and working with NSPCC to expand and promote the adult helpline by providing them with an extra £1.6 million.This means children have someone to call and more adults will be able to raise concerns and seek advice about the safety and wellbeing of any child that they’re worried about.Like the rest of the population, all our teachers have had to adapt very quickly to new ways of working. They have had to move resources online, work remotely, change the way they support their students as well as one another.I am immensely grateful to them and to everyone who has offered their support, including those who have made resources freely available for schools, parents and pupils to use.We have already published an initial list of high quality online educational resources including how to support physical and mental wellbeing and materials for teaching children with special educational needs and disabilities.In yet another example of how we are at our best when we work together, some of our leading state schools have collaborated to open The Oak National Academy, which will be launched online tomorrow (20 April).This is a totally new initiative, led by 40 brilliant teachers who have assembled video lessons and resources for any teacher in the country to make use of if they wish to do so. 180 video lessons will be provided each week, across a broad range of subjects, for every year group from Reception through to Year 10.I recognise all the challenges that families will be facing at the moment and we are determined to support parents who are helping their children learn from home. I think we all know how difficult that can be.The BBC has developed resources for families as part of the most comprehensive education package in their history, available on TV and online from tomorrow morning.And to make sure as many children as possible can access online learning, we are ordering laptops to help disadvantaged young people who sit key exams next year.We will also provide laptops and tablets for those children with social workers and care leavers to help them stay in touch with the services they need, keeping them safe and supporting home learning.And if disadvantaged secondary school pupils and care leavers who are preparing for exams do not already have internet connections, we’ll provide free 4G routers to get them connected while schools are closed.We are also working with major telecommunications providers to exempt certain educational resources from data charges, so that this does not add to household expenses that may already be very stretched at this moment.Before I finish, I would like to applaud the remarkable way our education community has responded to this outbreak. I am enormously proud and inspired by the incredible spirit they are showing.Schools are supporting their communities in every way, from preparing food parcels to sharing their facilities with local hospitals. Colleges are manufacturing and donating equipment and universities are working flat out to develop diagnostic tests and, of course, a vaccine which will help us beat this invisible enemy.And to any young people watching, I wanted to say to you how sorry I am that you have had your education disrupted in this way.I know how hard it must be and I would like to thank you for making the adjustments you have had to make.I know you will be missing your friends, your teachers and your lessons. I want you to know that you are an important part of this fight too and I cannot thank you enough for all that you are doing.This global pandemic is the biggest threat that this country has faced in modern times. If we all continue to work together, as we have been, and if we continue to stick to the advice of our experts, we will come out the other side and be able to begin the task of rebuilding our communities.I would like now to hand over to Jenny and then we will take some questions."
Communities Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 18 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/communities-secretary-robert-jenrick-on-covid-19-response-18-april-2020,Communities Secretary,2020-04-18,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 18 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 18 April 2020.Good afternoon,Welcome to the coronavirus press conference from Downing Street.I’m joined by Steve Powis, national medical director of NHS England.Steve will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus shortly.But, first, let me update you on the steps we are taking to defeat it, and the decisions we have taken today.Our fight against this virus is happening all across the country, in every home, in every community.Today’s data shows that:460,437 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out across Great Britain, including 21,389 tests carried out yesterday114,217 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 5,526 cases since yesterday17,759 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in Great Britain, down from 18,711 yesterdayAnd sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 15,464 have now died. That’s an increase of 888 fatalities since yesterday.These are heart-breaking losses for every family affected.Every part of our government, from Whitehall to your local town hall is working together in this national effort.And nowhere is that clearer than on the front lines in our communities.And today as Community Secretary I want to provide an update.Councils are delivering essential supplies to clinically vulnerable people - those we have asked to shield themselves, paying out financial relief to businesses to enable their local economies to weather the storm as much as is possible, ensuring our bins continue to be collected, ensuring that schools remain open for the children of key workers and vulnerable families are kept in regular contact, and they are helping rough sleepers off the streets to protect them from the virus.This effort, alongside the endeavours of all our public servants, is making a difference in this fight.But I know it is our responsibility in government to make sure that those front-line workers have the resources they need to keep up this essential work.At the beginning of this emergency I told local councils that we would give them the resources they need to do the job. And I meant it.And that is why today I am providing an additional £1.6 billion of new funding to support councils with the pressures they face as they respond to COVID-19.This funding takes the total amount given to councils to help them through the pandemic to over £3.2 billion.We are backing councils to ensure vital services such as adult social care, children’s services, support for vulnerable people and waste collection continue despite the increased pressures.We are also helping councils with inevitable cashflow challenges by deferring £2.6 billion in business rates payments to central government and paying them £850 million in social care grants up front this month.Working with councils and charities, we’ve made huge progress in protecting the vulnerable during this national emergency.Our plans to shield the most clinically vulnerable people have progressed well.Three weeks ago I reported at this press conference that the first government organised boxes of supplies had been delivered by wholesalers to those at highest risk across the country. Today 250,000 have been delivered. The packages include cereal, fruit, tinned goods, teabags, biscuits, toiletries and other essentials.And this coming week we expect to be delivering 300,000 boxes – all from a standing start just a few weeks ago.And our call centre is making up to 130,000 calls a day to those who are shielded, to see if they need this service, to see if they still need it or want to move to a priority delivery slot at their local supermarket.In addition to this, councils are organising their own calls, often led by volunteers, including our 750,000 NHS volunteers, to check in and chat with the shielded.And they have organised their own efforts to support those who may not have one of the clinical conditions to be shielded but are nonetheless vulnerable or isolated. And there are truly extraordinary efforts underway in this regard, in every village, parish, town, ward, estate and city, the length and breadth of the country.We have all been humbled by the gestures, large and small, by people across the country to show support for those working so hard to protect the NHS and to save lives. None more so than Captain Tom Moore, who has raised an astonishing £23 million this week for NHS charities.I can’t think of a more worthy person to be the guest of honour at the opening of the new Nightingale hospital in Harrogate next week – also, fittingly, the county of his birth, Yorkshire.I am sure everyone will join me in thanking Captain Tom for his truly heroic effort.I have also been proud of the effort of councils to help vulnerable people in their areas, including securing safe accommodation for rough sleepers.And our plan to protect rough sleepers has resulted in over 90% being offered safe accommodation.I want to thank all those who have made this possible, including local councils, charities and other organisations and those continuing to help the small number of people still regrettably on our streets today.Of course, this is not the end of rough sleeping. And there is a great deal of work to be done and my departments and I will be at the heart of that.I want to also say something about support for our high streets and local businesses by local councils.I’m delighted that so many cafes, restaurants and other businesses have taken up the opportunity to switch to offering delivery, takeaway and click and collect services. This expands the supply of food available to people alongside the supermarkets, as well as allowing businesses that would otherwise have closed to remain open and keep paying staff.This simple freedom has been taken up by enterprising people the length across the UK. The same enterprising people whose enguinity, sometimes assisted by government in modest ways like this, will help us to rebuild our economy.Councils have worked hard to pay out over £1 billion worth of business grants from government.But it’s vital that we all ensure that all eligible businesses get the support that it needs, and I urge councils who have been slower in making progress to their accelerate efforts in the days to come.Let me address two other topics that I know are of concern to people.Firstly, there have been examples of some parks around the country closing.This cannot be right.While the virus does not discriminate, we know that the lockdown is much harder for people who don’t have a lot of living space, who don’t have a garden, and who don’t have anywhere for their children to run around.People need parks.That’s why I have made it clear to councils that all parks must remain open.For the health of the nation, people should be able to safely enjoy fresh air and green space.And, for the health of the nation, people must abide by social distancing rules and not congregate in groups in parks.Secondly, there have been some reports of mourners being turned away at funerals.The tragedy of the death of Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, a 13 year old boy from Brixton, was compounded by the fact that his family were unable to attend his funeral.That is not right and it shouldn’t have happened.For clarity – funerals can go ahead with close family present.Social distancing measures must be respected, but families must have the opportunity to say a respectful goodbye to those that they love.We will be publishing more guidance on this shortly. And I’m also asking councils to keep open or indeed reopen cemeteries and graveyards. Not for people to congregate in. That must not happen. But for people to make that private visit. To seek solace in a word at the grave of someone you have loved. Or to privately lay flowers. There have been times in my life when I have needed to do that. I’m certain there are people who need to do it today.These are small steps. But small mercies can make a big difference.And local councils, at their best, can help to make life, even in times like this, more liveable and more humane.They represent and can harness the networks of familiarity and loyalty upon which a society is based.The sense that we belong together. And that we will stand by each other in a real emergency.Those relationships can only be built from below, by people, to people, in communities.To all the unsung heroes of local councils. For all you are doing for us all.Thank you."
Business Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 17 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-17-april-2020,Business Secretary,2020-04-17,"Coronavirus press conference 17 April 2020Good afternoon. I am joined today by the government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance and Dr Yvonne Doyle who is the medical director of Public Health England.Before I talk about some decisions taken today, and Sir Patrick provides an update on the latest data, I would like to set out the steps we are taking to defeat coronavirus.Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of the virus so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the NHS’s ability to cope.At each point we have been following scientific and medical advice and we have been deliberate in our actions - taking the right steps at the right time.We are also taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the numbers of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment on the front-line to give people the care they need when they need it most.This is why we are instructing people to stay at home, so we can protect our NHS and save lives.I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:A total of 438,991 people in the UK have now been tested for coronavirus, that includes 21,328 tests carried out yesterday.Of those, 108,692 people have tested positive.That is an increase of 5,599 cases since yesterday.18,978 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK.And sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 14,576 have now died.That is an increase of 847 fatalities since yesterday.We must never forget that behind every statistic is a family member or a friend.And all our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.These figures are a powerful reminder to us all of the importance of following the government’s guidance.And as the Foreign Secretary outlined yesterday, the current social distancing measures will remain in place for at least the next 3 weeks.And there are 5 tests that must be satisfied before we will consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures.First, we must protect the NHS’s ability to cope. We must be confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate from coronavirus, so we can be confident that we have moved beyond the peak.Third, we need to have reliable data from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.Fourth, we need to be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.Fifth, and most importantly, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS.The worst thing we could do now, is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of the virus to hit the NHS and hit the British people.So I want to thank each and every person across the UK who is following and supporting the government’s advice to stay at home, in order that we protect our NHS and, ultimately, save lives.I know we are asking you to make sacrifices. And it is challenging. But we need to keep going. Working together, we will defeat this invisible enemy.Now is not the time to let up. The risk still persists – not only for yourself, but for the people around you. So we must stay vigilant.But of course, the point we hope to get to, one of the ways we can defeat this virus, is to find a vaccine.Just as Edward Jenner developed the smallpox vaccine in the eighteenth century, we need to apply the best of British scientific endeavour to the search for the coronavirus vaccine.To that end I can announce today, that the government has set up a Vaccines Taskforce to co-ordinate the efforts of government, academia and industry towards a single goal:To accelerate the development of a coronavirus vaccine.This taskforce is up and running and aims to ensure that a vaccine is made available to the public, as quickly as possible.The taskforce, reporting to me and the Health Secretary, is led by Sir Patrick and Professor Jonathan van Tam.It comprises representatives from government, industry, academia and regulators.Members include Government Life Sciences Champion Sir John Bell, as well as AstraZeneca, and the Wellcome Trust.The taskforce will support progress across all stages of vaccine development, at pace.It will back Britain’s most promising research, positioning the UK as a leader in clinical vaccine testing and manufacturing.The taskforce will co-ordinate with regulators to facilitate trials which are both rapid and well supervised.And it will work with industry in the UK and internationally, so we are in a position to manufacture vaccines at scale.This will build on the Prime Minister’s announcement last month of a further £210 million for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the international fund to find a vaccine.I can confirm that the government has green lighted a further 21 research projects to help fight coronavirus.In total, these projects will receive £14 million from a £25 million government research investment and include backing the development of a vaccine at Imperial College London.This follows support for 6 projects, announced last month, including vaccine development led by Professor Sarah Gilbert at the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute. This is already carrying out preclinical trials and, with government support, will shortly move into a clinical trial phase.And we are looking forward. So when we do make a breakthrough, we are ready to manufacture it by the millions.One tool in this fight will be the UK’s first Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre based in Harwell.A project that will help build our capacity to develop and mass produce vaccines here in the UK.The government will be accelerating the building of this facility.The Bioindustry Association is also working closely with our taskforce and bringing together a whole range of businesses keen to use their expertise to mass produce vaccines, as soon as one is ready.I want to pay a heartfelt tribute to all the scientists and researchers, working tirelessly, on these projects.Yet even with all their efforts, we should be under no illusions.Producing a vaccine is a colossal undertaking.A complex process which will take many months.There are no guarantees.But the government is backing our scientists, betting big to maximise the chances of success.I am proud of how, again and again, Britain has stepped up and answered the call to action.An enormous challenge being tackled through a vast national effort.Where problem-solvers, from science, business and government join forces to beat this invisible killer.We cannot put a date on when we will get a vaccine.But we live in a country with a rich history of pioneering science.And with the government backing our scientists we have the best chance to do this as quickly as possible."
Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-april-2020,Foreign Secretary,2020-04-16,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 16 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 16 April 2020.Good afternoon, welcome to the daily coronavirus press conference from Downing Street.I’m joined by Sir Patrick Valance, the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor, and Professor Chris Whitty, the government’s Chief Medical Officer. Sir Patrick will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus.But, first, let me update you on the steps we are taking to defeat the coronavirus, and the decisions we have taken today.Step-by-step, our action plan aims to slow the spread of the virus. So that fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, and that is the way we can protect the NHS from being overwhelmed.At every step along this way, we have followed, very carefully and deliberately, the scientific and medical advice that we have received. So that we take the right steps at the right moment in time.At the same time, we are dramatically expanding NHS capacity, in terms of the numbers of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment on the front-line, so people get the care they need, at the point in time that they need it most.And that’s also why we have directed people to stay at home. To deny coronavirus the opportunity to spread, to protect the NHS and save lives.Now, today’s data shows that:327, 608 people in the UK have now been tested for the coronavirus  103,093 people have tested positive  and sadly, of those with the virus, 13,729 have now diedThese are heart-breaking losses for every family affected. And it reminds us exactly why we need to follow the social distancing guidance.Earlier today, I chaired meetings of the Cabinet and COBR to consider the advice from SAGE on the impact of the existing social distancing measures.There are indications that the measures we have put in place have been successful in slowing down the spread of the virus. But, SAGE also say that it is a mixed and inconsistent picture and, in some settings, infections are still likely to be increasing.SAGE assess that the rate of infection, or the R value, is almost certainly below 1 in the community. That means that on average each infected person is, in turn, infecting less than one other person.But, overall, we still don’t have the infection rate down as far as we need to. As in other countries, we have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes.In sum, the very clear advice we have received is that any change to our social distancing measures now would risk a significant increase in the spread of the virus.That would threaten a second peak of the virus, and substantially increase the number of deaths. It would undo the progress made to date, and as a result, would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.So early relaxation would do more damage to the economy over a longer period.I want to be clear about this. The advice from SAGE is that relaxing any of the measures currently in place would risk damage to both public health and our economy. Patrick and Chris will be able to go into further detail on all of this shortly.But based on this advice, the government has determined that current measures must remain in place for at least the next 3 weeks.Now, in terms of the decisions that lie ahead, we want to be as up front with the British people as we possibly can. So, let me set out 5 specific things which the government will need to be satisfied of before we will consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures.First, we must protect the NHS’s ability to cope. We must be confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. The NHS staff have been incredible. We must continue to support them as much as we can.Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from coronavirus so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.Third, we need to have reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.Fourth, we need to be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.Fifth, and this is really crucial, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS. The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of the virus to hit the NHS and hit the British people. It would be the worst outcome, not just for public health, but for the economy and for our country as a whole.So, the current restrictions will remain in place. The government will continue to monitor the data on the impact of the virus.We will soon be able to test 100,000 people every day. That will give us greater understanding of the scope of infection across the country. It will also help us plan how to change the measures when we are ready to.When we are confident on these 5 points.Guided by science and data, we will look to adjust the measures to make them as effective as possible in protecting public health, while allowing some economic and social activity to resume. We will only do it, when the evidence demonstrates that is safe to do it.It could involve relaxing measures in some areas, while strengthening measures in other areas. But in formulating the right balance we will be at all times guided by the scientific advice and the evidence.I should add at this point that we recognise all the economic and social impact the current measures are having. That is why we put in place an unprecedented package of support for jobs and businesses, as well as for hospices and charities who are doing so much to support the most vulnerable in our society.And, I know that many people would like to hear more detail, some people are calling for exact dates, on what will happen next, and when.We are as being as open as we responsibly can at this stage. And it would not be responsible to pre-judge the evidence that SAGE will have and review in just a few weeks’ time.I know some people will look at other countries, and ask why the UK isn’t doing what they’re doing.I can reassure people that we carefully follow what is happening in other countries. We will always look to learn any lessons in how they are approaching their response. And I’m talking to foreign ministers on a daily basis, I know Chris and Patrick are doing the same with their opposite numbers around the world.Ultimately, we have to do what is right for the British people, based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions here in the UK, and we will make those decisions at the right time for this country.That’s what we have done so far. That’s what we will continue to do.I appreciate the impact of these measures is considerable on people and businesses across the country. The costs being shouldered. The sacrifices people are making. Being isolated from friends and family. Whole households, cooped up inside, all week long.Parents having difficult conversations with their young children, who just don’t understand why they can’t visit grandparents or go outside and meet up with friends as they normally do. Families struggling managing home-schooling, and balancing that with working from home.I know there are people very concerned about their household finances. Uncertain about their jobs. Worried for their small businesses that remain closed.We get it. We know it’s rough going at this time.Every time I come to this lectern, and I read out the grim toll of people who have so sadly passed away. I walk away from here, and I think about what their sons and their daughters must be going through right now. Their brothers and sisters. Their grandchildren. All the loved ones left with their unbearable, long-term, grief.It makes me and it makes this government focus even harder on what we must do. And, I know that, together, united, we must keep up this national effort for a while longer.We’ve just come too far, we’ve lost too many loved ones, we’ve already sacrificed far too much to ease up now, especially when we’re beginning to see the evidence that our efforts are starting to pay off.And your efforts are paying off. There is light at the end of the tunnel.But, we’re now at both a delicate and dangerous stage of this pandemic. If we rush to relax the measures in place, we would risk wasting all the sacrifices and all the progress we have made. And that would risk a quick return to another lockdown. With all the threat to life a second peak of the virus would bring, and all the economic damage a second lockdown would carry. So we need to be patient a while longer.So please please stay home, save lives and protect the NHS. So we can safely return to life as close to normal as possible, as soon as possible.It’s been an incredible national team effort. Now is not the moment to give the coronavirus a second chance. Let’s stick together, let’s see this through. And let’s defeat the coronavirus for good.Find out more about coronavirus (COVID-19): what you need to do.

Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-15-april-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-04-15,"Coronavirus press conference: 15 April 2020Good afternoon and welcome to the daily coronavirus briefing.I am joined by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and the Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser, Angela McLean.I want to start by thanking everyone who is staying at home, even in this sunshine. Together, we are slowing the spread of this virus. And I want to pay a special tribute today to Captain Tom Moore who, at the age of 99, has raised over £7 million so far for NHS charities by completing 100 laps of his garden. Captain Tom, you’re an inspiration to us all and we thank you.At the core of our plan is to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed, so its ability to care for everybody that needs that care is always there and is never outmatched by the ability of the virus to do us harm. That is central to our plan and I’m glad to say that the spare capacity in critical care in the NHS today has reached a new record high of 2,657 beds.Expanding the NHS faster than the growth in demand has been a critical objective throughout this crisis. And it means that every single person who’s accessed NHS care has been able to get the very best available. At no point has the NHS been unable to offer care to people suffering from coronavirus. Now I know at the start of this crisis, some people said that would be impossible. But, so far, we’ve met this objective throughout and I want to thank all those involved for their part in this national effort.On the most recent figures, 313,769 people have now been tested for coronavirus. Of these, 98,476 people have tested positive. The number of patients in hospital with symptoms is now 19,529. 12,868 people have sadly died, an increase of 761.This all just goes to show why we cannot let up in our efforts. We cannot let go of the hard work that’s been done so far. This shared sacrifice, and I know it’s a sacrifice, is starting to work. But, we will not lift these measures until it is safe to do so. Everyone who stays at home is doing their bit, protecting the NHS and saving lives.But, while everyone else stays at home to save lives, our health and care workers go out to work to save lives. And, today, I want to focus on social care. I want to set out the next steps in our action plan for social care that we’re publishing today.From the moment of the emergence of coronavirus, we’ve known that some of the most vulnerable to this disease are in social care and we’ve been taking action right from the start.We first set out guidance back in February and today I can tell you what further steps we’re now able to make. Our goal throughout has been to protect residents and to support our 1.5 million colleagues who work in social care. We’ve injected an extra £1.6 billion and, as the Chancellor said, we will do whatever it takes.This is our plan.First and foremost, from the start, we’ve focused on the need to control the spread of infection in social care settings. Today, we’ve strengthened the rules, so that all care home residents who are discharged from hospital will be tested before being admitted into their care home. We’ll test all symptomatic care home residents. And, as I announced last Friday, we’ve introduced testing for all social care colleagues and members of their households who need a test.At the same time, we’re increasing again PPE supplies for social care. We’re creating a supply logistics and distribution network of unprecedented scale. Building on the PPE plan I set out on Friday, over the next 3 weeks we’ll continue priority drops to the Local Resilience Forums who distribute to the social care system according to local need, while we roll out our new online delivery system for social care settings. This will be integrated with the NHS supply chain central PPE logistical operations, with kit shipped directly to social care providers via the Royal Mail.All of this will contribute to slowing the spread of coronavirus within care homes.I want also to enhance support for our social care workforce. One of the things that I’m most proud of during this terrible crisis is that people have held health and social care workers in such high esteem. It’s not ‘clap for the NHS’, it’s ‘clap for our carers’. And to take this further, we’re today introducing a single brand for social care to symbolise the entire care profession. This is something I know so many people in the profession have called for.This badge will be a badge of honour in a very real sense, allowing social care staff proudly and publicly to identify themselves, just like NHS staff do with that famous blue and white logo.I know that many businesses will want to offer the same recognition and benefits as they do wonderfully to the NHS. We’ve asked the supermarkets to confirm that social care workers can have the same priority access and I know that the public value your work in care as much as I do. I also know that we need more people to return to social care or choose to serve for the first time.To make that happen, we’re strengthening our national recruitment campaign with the aim of recruiting tens of thousands more people into social care. And we will pay for the initial induction training. This is a job where you have the chance to make a difference to people’s lives every single day that you go to work.And I’ve seen, as I’m sure we’ve all seen, the amazing efforts of good social care. I’ve seen it with elderly members of my own family. I’ve seen the tenderness and the dedication with which people in social care support our loved ones at their time of greatest need.Everyone knows the job isn’t easy. Whether supporting people of working age, who are some of the most vulnerable in society, or supporting people and their families with dignity at the end of their lives. But I know what a fulfilling profession it is and I know that many will answer our call.There’s one other thing, and one other change, I want to make, which is giving people the right to say goodbye. One of the important things that care homes do is support people at the end of their life. Sadly, even in normal times, each month, about 10,000 people die in care homes. And our social care colleagues work incredibly hard to ensure support for people and dignity to people at the end of their lives.Wanting to be with someone you love at the end of their life is one of the deepest human instincts. And it’s a moment that will be with you forever. Done right, it can help those left behind to cope and it brings comfort to those who are dying. Coronavirus of course has made this much more difficult. and I’ve been really moved and upset at some of the heart-breaking stories of people dying without a loved one nearby.As a father of a 13-year-old myself, the reports of Ismail, dying aged 13 without a parent at his bedside, made me weep. And the sight of his coffin being lowered into a grave without a member of his family present was too awful. So, I’m pleased to say that, working with Public Health England, the care sector and many others, we’re introducing new procedures so we can limit the risk of infection, while, wherever possible, giving people’s loved ones the chance to say goodbye.And we’re making crystal clear that it is unacceptable for advanced care plans, including ‘do not attempt to resuscitate’ orders, to be applied in a blanket fashion to any group of people. This must always be a personalised process, as it always has been.I want to end by addressing carers directly. As much as the doctors, the nurses, the paramedics – you are on the frontline in this battle. I want to thank you for your courage and your commitment. For doing paid or unpaid, formal or informal, the work that you do, difficult, demanding, vitally necessary, and you do it with such love and care and attention.Taking on the extra shifts that might be needed to fill the gaps left by self-isolating colleagues, juggling your own caring responsibilities very often, providing dignity and comfort to people in some of the most difficult circumstances. We, as a nation, stand with you.And I say to everyone watching, you can stand with our carers too. By staying at home, to protect the NHS and protect social care, and save lives."
Chancellor's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 14 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/chancellor-delivers-daily-coronavirus-update-14-april-2020,Chancellor,2020-04-14,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 14 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 14 April 2020.Good evening from Downing Street, where I’m joined by Steve Powis, Medical Director of the NHS and Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England.Earlier today, the government’s independent fiscal watchdog……the Office for Budget Responsibility, the OBR……published a report into the impact of coronavirus on the economy and public finances.It’s important to be clear that the OBR’s numbers are not a forecast or prediction.They simply set out what one possible scenario might look like – and it may not even be the most likely scenario.But it’s important we are honest with people about what might be happening to our economy.So before I turn to the health figures, I want to spend a few minutes explaining what the OBR have said - and let me thank them for their continued work.There are three brief points I want to make.First, the OBR’s figures suggest the scale of what we are facing will have serious implications for our economy here at home……in common with other countries around the world.These are tough times – and there will be more to come.As I’ve said before, we can’t protect every business and every household.But we came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British business.So while those economic impacts are significant – the OBR also expect them to be temporary……with a bounce back in growth.The second point I want to make is that we’re not just going to stand by and watch this happen.Our planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.Our response aims to directly support people and businesses while the restrictions are in place……and to make sure as restrictions are changed, we can, as quickly as possible, get people back to work; get businesses moving again; and recover our economy.The OBR today have been clear that the policies we have set out will do that.The OBR today have been clear that if we had not taken the actions we have, the situation would be much worse.In other words, our plan is the right plan.The third point I want to make is this: right now, the single most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people.It’s not a case of choosing between the economy and public health – common sense tells us that doing so would be self-defeating.At a time when we are seeing hundreds of people dying every day from this terrible disease, the absolute priority must be to focus all of our resources……not just of the state, but of businesses, and of all of you at home as well, in a collective national effort to beat this virus.The government’s approach is to follow scientific and medical advice through our step-by-step action plan……aiming to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the NHS’s ability to cope.I said in my Budget a month ago that whatever the NHS needs, it will get – and we have honoured that promise:Yesterday we published an update showing that we’ve given our public services an extra £14.5 billion in recent weeks.We are taking action to increase NHS capacity, with more beds, more key staff and more equipment on the front-line.And the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care will be updating on our plans for social care tomorrow.This is why we are instructing people to stay at home, so that we can protect our NHS and save lives.I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:    302,599 people in the UK have now been tested for coronavirus, with 93,873 people testing positive        19,706 people in the UK have been admitted to hospital with the virus, down from 20,184 people yesterday;        Sadly, of those in hospital, 12,107 people have now died – an increase of 778 fatalities since yesterday.  Our thoughts are with the families and friends of all those who have lost their lives.These figures are a powerful reminder to us all of the importance of following the government’s guidance:Stay at home. Protect our NHS. And save lives.Thank you – I’ll now hand over to Steve to take you through today’s data in more detail, before we take questions from the media."

I updated him on coronavirus, the progress we’re making, and our plans for the next few weeks.The government is united in our focus, our determination and our national mission to defeat the coronavirus.And defeat it, we will.I want to join the PM in expressing our heart-felt thanks to the brilliant NHS team at St Thomas’s hospital.And, as the Easter bank holiday weekend draws to a close, I also need to thank all of the NHS staff, all of the other frontline staff, who have been working so hard over the long weekend to care for those suffering from coronavirus.We thank you.We pay tribute to you.And we’re immensely proud of all you are doing.Can I also take the opportunity to thank everyone who followed the advice to stay home, despite the wonderful weather, and despite the challenges and sacrifices that sticking to the advice presents to many families.I have to say that at the end of last week, we were concerned that people might start ignoring the advice, or cutting corners given the temptation to go out into the sunshine.In fact, the overwhelming majority of people stayed at home and understood the importance of doing so.You stuck to the advice.You denied the coronavirus of the social contact it needs to spread.People should be in absolutely no doubt that, by staying home this weekend, you have saved lives, and you also helped protect our precious NHS at this critical moment in the crisis.So thank you.Your efforts are making all the difference, and please keep them up.We’ve come too far, we’ve lost too many loved ones, and we’ve sacrificed far too much to ease up now.I can tell you on the latest data that 290,720 have been tested for coronavirus, 88,621 have now tested positive.And, I’m very sorry to say, 11,329 people have now died from coronavirus, every one of them a tragedy, and our hearts go out to all of the loved ones who are grieving their loss at such a difficult time.Amidst this sobering death toll, there are also some positive signs from the data that we are starting to win this struggle, but we have still got a long way to go and as those grisly figures I just read out show, we’re still not past the peak of this virus.So please continue to follow the advice, now more than ever, to stay at home, save lives and protect our NHS.This week, SAGE will review the evidence of the effectiveness of the social distancing measures we’ve taken, and we will consider their assessment, based on the evidence, at that point.I should say, we don’t expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point, and we won’t, until we’re confident as we realistically can be, that any such changes can be safely made.In the meantime, the government will continue to redouble all of our efforts to buy and deliver the ventilators so we can treat the most vulnerable in our hospitals.To deliver the masks, the gowns and other protective equipment to protect those on the frontline, in the NHS, but also in care homes.And to ramp up testing so that the NHS and other key staff can return to the frontline just as soon as possible.The Chancellor and Business Secretary are working round the clock to mitigate the damage that this crisis has undoubtedly done to our economy - getting support to businesses, to workers and to the most vulnerable in our society.So please, once again, keep following the guidance to stay home, save lives and protect the NHS.If we let up now the virus will only take full advantage.It will spread faster and it will kill more people.If we refuse to give into it, if we keep up this incredible team effort, we will beat this virus, and we will come through this national test.Our plan is working.Please stick with it, and we’ll get through this crisis together.

Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 12 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-12-april-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-04-12,"Coronavirus press conference: 12 April 2020Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s daily coronavirus briefing. I’m joined today by Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England.And, before I outline the latest on coronavirus and the work that we’re doing as a government to tackle it, I wanted to briefly update you about the Prime Minister’s condition.It’s great news that the Prime Minister has been discharged from hospital and is now continuing his recovery at Chequers. I hope everyone has seen his message of love, and thanks to all those who’ve supported his recovery and to the NHS colleagues who have cared for him so brilliantly at St Thomas’s Hospital. I know that they have cared for him as they would care for anybody in this country and it’s one of the things that makes me so proud ‒ that the NHS is there for us all and can give its very best to every single person and has been able to throughout this crisis.I know that all of his thoughts are with those affected by this illness, and of course the government is working constantly through our coronavirus action plan. And the aim is to protect life and to protect the NHS, both by slowing the spread of the virus to flatten the curve and by ensuring that the NHS is always there for you and always has more than enough capacity to meet the demands that are placed on it.Today marks a sombre day in the impact of this disease as we join the list of countries who have seen more than 10,000 deaths related to coronavirus.The fact that over 10,000 people have now lost their lives to this invisible killer demonstrates just how serious coronavirus is and why the national effort that everyone is engaged in is so important.According to the most recent figures, 282,374 people have now been tested for coronavirus.  84,279 have tested positive. Across Great Britain, the number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms is now 19,945 and, of those who’ve contracted the virus, 10,612 have tragically died. Our sincere condolences are with all of them, with their families, their friends. Their grief is our grief, and their stories will not be forgotten.On Friday, I said that staying at home this Easter weekend would be a major test of the nation’s resolve. And I am pleased to say that the nation is rising to this challenge. I know that for some people this has been extra tough, if you’re at home with children, if you can’t visit relatives because they’re shielding, if you’re unable to go to church on this most important day for Christians. Your steadfast commitment to following the social distancing rules is making a difference. Thank you for the part that you are playing in helping to protect lives at this critical time in our nation’s history.But we cannot be complacent, not when there is so much is at stake, so, please, keep going, stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.Today, I want to provide an update on the work we’re doing to slow the spread of the virus and to build capacity. The latest figures show that in Great Britain we have 2,295 spare critical care beds, up 150 from yesterday.So, throughout this crisis, with all challenges that we’ve been dealing with, all the operational difficulties and all of the logistics, we have always been able to provide the very best of care to everybody who needs it through the NHS.At the start of the crisis, people said that the NHS would be overwhelmed and we’ve seen that, and we’ve seen the risk of that, elsewhere, but not here. And that is because of the action that a huge number of people have taken, the incredible work of so many.There is more spare capacity now for critical care than there was when coronavirus first hit our shores. And this is before the Nightingale hospitals come on stream. London’s has opened, and we’re already in process of building 6 more around England.This critical expansion is partly because we have a record number of ventilators, 9,775, and partly because we have record numbers of returners coming back and rejoining the NHS. Over 5,000 former staff are now back on the NHS frontline and over 36,000 have come forward to enlist. And this bolstered capacity has been backed by substantial financial support. As the Chancellor has said, whatever our NHS and vital public services need during this time, they will have.But of course there is always more that must be done. So, we’re increasing the amount of PPE and I’m glad to say that there are now record amounts in the system. And we need the right amounts of medicine too, and I can assure everyone that we’re working very closely with the pharmaceutical supply chain and hospital pharmacies so that the right medicines are there to treat people. And I’m glad to see the reassurances that have been provided today that everybody can have the medicines they need in order to get the care that they need.And when we debate the operational challenges we face, I want to be transparent about every single one. Let us not forget that the core measure of NHS capacity, which is what matters to you when you or one of your loved ones needs it, is whether you can get the best care if you catch coronavirus. On that, we are succeeding and in fact succeeding more with each passing day.I also wanted to provide a brief update on the work on PPE, which is so important for NHS and social care staff. I pay tribute to our health and care staff who, this weekend, just like every weekend, are giving the best possible care. On Thursdays, on streets, front doors and balconies up and down the country, we’ve seen the esteem with which the whole nation holds our carers, the people who make the NHS and social care what it is, and we owe it to them to get them the equipment that they need.On Friday, we published a comprehensive PPE plan, which is based on everyone using the right PPE according to the agreed guidelines. And, daily, we’re delivering millions of items to the frontline.Now I know that there have also been questions about gowns. In the last 2 days, 121,000 gowns have been delivered around the country, and more are going out today and in the week to come. So, we’re working very hard to resolve all of these individual logistical challenges.It’s worth saying that the average time for dealing with PPE queries has gone down from 6 days in March to an average of 2 and half days over the past week. And, since we published the plan last week, I’m delighted with the sheer number of businesses that have come forward to help with our PPE effort, even over the bank holiday weekend. Thank you to all of you and to all those that are involved in this enormous, herculean effort on PPE, and I know that we’ll see many more businesses coming forward and I look forward to it.Testing, of course, has a huge role in our response and we have discussed repeatedly testing at these press conferences. I’m pleased to say that 42,812 NHS and social care staff and their families have now been tested. And, as we ramp up our ability to test in large numbers, we also need to make sure we have the ability to trace contacts just as effectively.And so, today, I wanted to outline the next step: a new NHS app for contact tracing. If you become unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus, you can securely tell this new NHS app, and the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users that you’ve been in significant contact with over the past few days, even before you had symptoms, so that they know and can act accordingly.All data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards and would only be used for NHS care and research and we won’t hold it any longer than it’s needed. And, as part of our commitment to transparency, we will be publishing the source code too. We’re already testing this app and, as we do this, we’re working closely with the world’s leading tech companies and renowned experts in clinical safety and digital ethics so that we can get this right.I want to thank all of these world-leading experts who’ve been involved. The more people who get involved, then the better informed our response to coronavirus will be and the better we can protect the NHS.Her Majesty the Queen spoke for all of us, as she so often does, when she said that Easter is not cancelled and that we need it now more than ever. This is an uncertain Easter for so many people. At a time when we normally come physically together, we must stay apart. It runs counter to every human instinct and every intuition that we possess, but we must persevere.Because, if we follow the rules and slow the spread of the virus, then each new day will bring us closer to normal life. And we can enjoy Easters to come, safe in the knowledge that, when it mattered, we did our bit and rose to the challenge. And we put our loved ones, we put our NHS staff and we put our local communities first.So please, this Easter, stay home, protect the NHS and save lives."
Home Secretary's statement on domestic abuse and coronavirus (COVID-19): 11 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/home-secretary-outlines-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims,Home Secretary,2020-04-11,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 11 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 11 April 2020.Good afternoon, welcome to Downing Street for the Government’s daily press conference on coronavirus.I am joined today by Martin Hewitt, Chair of the National Police Chiefs Council, and by Professor Stephen Powis.I would like to update you on the Government’s plan to fight this pandemic.Our priority is to slow the spread of coronavirus, so that fewer people are sick at any one time, and our brilliant NHS continues to remain able to cope.To do this we are following expert scientific and medical advice and taking the right steps at the right moment in time.And that is why we are instructing people to stay home, to protect the NHS and save lives.I can report that, through the Government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of 9am today:    There have been 334,974 tests carried out across the UK, excluding Northern Ireland.        Of these, 78,991 have tested positive.        20,101 patients are currently in hospital who have already tested positive.        Sadly, 9,875 people have now died – an increase of 917 of yesterday.  As this virus continues to devastate families across our nation, my thoughts, prayers and heartfelt condolences are with their friends, their families and loved ones.To everyone suffering from this horrific virus, whether you are at home or receiving care from our brilliant NHS in hospital – you are in all of our thoughts at this devastating time.And I am very pleased to say that the Prime Minister continues to make good progress.But these stark figures highlight the gravity of this national emergency.The devastating impact of this virus, and the unprecedented but necessary action we are taking to tackle it, is affecting every aspect of our daily lives.This virus is also changing the nature of the threat we face from crime.Martin and myself will today update you on the emerging crime picture and the extra work the Government – along with law enforcement partners – is undertaking to better protect victims.As Martin will set out, total crime has dropped as people follow the necessary advice to stay at home.But, while the guidelines are helping to keep the majority of us safe – we think they could also amplify danger for others – leaving people feeling isolated, vulnerable and exposed.Because criminality continues to adapt.Fraudsters are exploiting coronavirus as a hook for new acquisitive crimes – with losses to victims already exceeding £1.8million.Perpetrators of sickening online child sexual abuse are seeking to exploit the fact that more young people and children are at home and are online.And in the last week alone, the National Domestic Abuse Helpline reported a 120% rise in the number of calls it received in one 24-hour period.Now while we have not yet seen a sustained rise in reports of domestic abuse to the police, the increase in those seeking help for this hidden crime is extremely concerning. And be in no doubt, there will be absolutely no let-up in our operational response.For the victims of these crimes, home is not the safe-haven it should be.That is why I have been working with law enforcement, charities, schools, businesses and local councils to address this changing threat picture.Our incredible police officers and firefighters are out in their communities - yes fighting crime, but also protecting victims.I want to emphasise that anyone who is a victim of these crimes can still get help.Anyone in immediate danger should call 999 - and press 55 on a mobile if you are unable to talk.Our outstanding police will, absolutely, still be there for you.The National Crime Agency are also bearing down on offenders and raising awareness to protect victims of fraud, cyber-crime and online child abuse.But, we must all do more to protect our neighbours, friends and family members by sharing information about the support that is available.The Chancellor this week announced a £750million boost for charities, including those providing services for victims of domestic abuse and their families.And today, I can announce that we will go even further to provide support for those in danger of domestic abuse.And I am launching a new national communications campaign to reach out to those who are at risk from abuse, highlighting that they can still leave home – to get the support that they need.It will signpost to victims how they can access help and but also to reassure them that they can access support services and the police are still on hand.And, importantly, it will tell them that they are not alone.Coronavirus has opened Britain’s enormous heart and shown our love and compassion for one another as we come together to help those most in need.And I am now asking this nation to use that amazing compassion and community spirit to embrace those trapped in the horrific cycle of abuse.And to help us all look out for those who need help, we have created a new campaign and we have created symbol of hope – a handprint with a heart on – so that people can easily show that we will not tolerate abuse as a society, and that we stand in solidarity with victims of domestic abuse.I ask you and I would urge everyone to share it on social media or in the windows of your home, alongside a link to the support available, to demonstrate just how much this country cares.And to show victims of domestic abuse, that they are not on their own.I am also providing up to £2 million to enhance online support services and helplines for domestic abuse, so that anybody who needs that help and support can access that help and support.These services will be boosted from new IT provided by the business, and in order to boost these services, we have secured support from Fujitsu to provide IT expertise to smaller domestic abuse charities to enable their specialist trained support workers to provide their crucial services remotely.We also know there are concerns about the capacity of refuges to provide enough accommodation during this challenging time.I’m clear about this – perpetrators should be the ones who have to leave the family home, not the supposed loved ones whom they torment and abuse.Our priority is to get abusers out, but, sadly, this is not always possible.So where a victim, and their children, do need to leave, we will ensure they have a safe place to go.That’s why we are looking at alternative accommodation to  best support the work of refuges and ensure that there are enough places for those in need at this difficult time.Fighting coronavirus requires an extraordinary national effort, and I would like to reiterate my personal thanks to everyone across all aspects of society playing their part.I am immensely grateful to everyone who is heeding the instruction to stay at home.This remains crucial over the bank holiday weekend and especially as the weather improves.But we have given the police powers to enforce the necessary measures we have put in place, including through the enforcement of fines.I’d like to thank them – our police officers and staff who are working tirelessly to keep us safe, for engaging with the public so constructively, to encourage everyone to do the right thing and avoid the need to use these powers.The overwhelming majority of the people are listening, making their own sacrifices to support our amazing police officers and staff, as they protect our under-pressure hospitals, and safeguard the most vulnerable.But my message to anyone still refusing to do the right thing is clear.If you don’t play your part, our selfless police – who are out there risking their own lives to save others - will be unafraid to act.Their work is helping our doctors, nurses and health professionals to fight this virus and to save lives.If you do not follow the guidance, you will be endangering the lives of your own friends, families and loved ones.To protect those you care about – and the capacity of our police and hospitals to protect us all – there is just one simple thing you must do.Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 10 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-10-april-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-04-10,"Coronavirus press conference: 10 April 2020Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing. I’m joined by the Chief Nursing Officer, Ruth May, and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Jonathan Van Tam.Our plan is to protect life and to protect the NHS, both by slowing the spread of this virus so we flatten the curve, and by ensuring that the NHS always has more capacity to provide critical care for those in need.Now, this is a national effort and every single person in this country can play their part in this plan. This Easter will be another test of the nation’s resolve. It’s a time of year when people normally come together. But, however warm the weather, however tempting your local beach or park, we need everyone to stay at home because, in hospitals across the country, NHS staff are battling day and night to keep desperately sick people breathing.And they need you to stay at home. I’m very happy to report that the Prime Minister’s condition continues to improve. He wants to personally thank the whole clinical team at St Thomas’s for the incredible care that he has received. His thoughts are with all of those who have been affected by this terrible disease. The NHS is there for all of us in this country and I know our amazing NHS staff have given the Prime Minister the very best care possible, in the same way that they would give every single person in this country the very best care possible.One of the things that makes me proud of this country is that it doesn’t matter who you are, the NHS is always there to care for you.Before updating you on our plan, I want to share the latest data from the ongoing monitoring and testing programme.Yesterday, I am glad to report that 19,116 tests were carried out across Great Britain. 5,706 tested positive. The number of people currently in hospital with coronavirus symptoms is 19,304. Of those who’ve contracted the virus, 8,958 have sadly died, an increase of 980 since yesterday.We never forget that behind this number, behind each one, is a name, a loss and a family that will never be the same again, and we all share a responsibility to tackle this virus first and foremost by staying at home.Now, earlier this month, I outlined our 5-pillar testing strategy and I’m glad to report a very positive response to setting out the goal of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month. I can announce today that we have capacity for all key social care staff and NHS staff who need to be tested to get those tests.To deliver this, in addition to the testing being done in NHS hospitals, we’ve now opened 15 drive-through testing centres, including in Glasgow, Cardiff, Belfast, Nottingham, Plymouth, Leeds and London, and other places.The UK life sciences industry is also answering our call to arms. Yesterday, I opened our first of our 3 ‘Lighthouse’ mega-labs in Milton Keynes. 2 more are on track, in Cheshire and in Glasgow, and AstraZeneca and GSK, 2 of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, are opening another in Cambridge. And I want to thank the team and all the volunteers who are working day and night to make this happen.Today, I want to address what we are doing to make sure that we have enough PPE, protective equipment, and to make sure that it gets to the right people. The goal I’ve set is that everyone working in a critical role must get the PPE that they need.NHS and care staff protect us – every day, while we are safe at home, they go off to work to care for us. We owe it to them to get them the kit they need to protect themselves.I want to be frank about the challenges our plan is designed to overcome. First, there is a huge international demand for PPE and a global squeeze on supply. Compounding this, some countries have placed export bans and other restrictions on PPE as they look to secure their domestic needs.Next, there’s high demand for PPE from within the UK. So, everyone should use this equipment, use the equipment they clinically need, in line with the guidelines, no more and no less.Then, of course, there’s the challenge of distribution. The sheer quantity and type of PPE needed has radically changed because of coronavirus. Many parts of the NHS and social care have never had to rely on weekly PPE deliveries before. In normal times, the NHS supply chain for protective equipment supplies 233 hospital trusts. Right now, 58,000 separate health and care providers need PPE.So, we’ve had to create a whole new logistics network essentially from scratch. All of these challenges around supply, around usage and distribution are being overcome, and I want to take a moment to set out in detail how.Today, we’re publishing our PPE plan. It has 3 strands.Strand 1 is about guidance: being clear who needs PPE, when they need it and who does not. There is enough PPE to go around, but only if it’s used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is. That means only using it when there is a clinical need, and not using more than is needed.Last week, following extensive consultation with the medical royal colleges, all 4 UK governments published updated guidance for what PPE to use in what circumstances. The new guidance included the clinical advice that many items of PPE can be used for a whole session, not be changed after treating each individual patient. Everyone is still protected but there’s enough PPE to go around.The guidance is also clear where PPE is not needed. Because, outside of health and social care, in most circumstances, the best way to protect yourself and to protect others is to regularly wash your hands, and wherever possible to keep at least 2 metres between you and other people when you leave your house.And of course the most important way to protect yourself is to stay at home. Because a front door is better than any face mask.The second strand of our PPE plan is about distribution: making sure that anyone who needs PPE can get it, and at the right time. This is a herculean logistical effort. We’ve brought together the NHS, private industry and the armed forces to create a giant PPE distribution network on an unprecedented scale. That network is now delivering daily to our frontline heroes. Quite literally.Since the start of the outbreak, we’ve now delivered over 742 million pieces of PPE to the frontline. This includes 161 million masks, 127 million aprons, 1 million gowns and 345 million pairs of gloves. These have reached hospitals, ambulance trusts, GP settings, social care, hospices and community pharmacies. We’ve also set up a 24/7 hotline for any providers experiencing supply problems.And crucially, every NHS hospital has received a delivery of critical PPE once every 72 hours, and over the next week we’re making that daily. This week we’ve arranged a priority drop of 30 million items of PPE to the Local Resilience Forums. The LRFs are in turn delivering to social care and others according to local need.And, in the coming weeks, we’ll be scaling up our PPE delivery systems still further. I can announce that over the next 3 weeks, we’re rolling out an online portal, allowing primary care and social care a system so that they can request PPE from a central inventory, and this will mean we can track demand in real time and deliver according to need.This herculean effort of enormous operational complexity to get the right piece of equipment to the right person at the right moment, I pay tribute to the enormous efforts of all of those making it happen. We will do everything we possibly can to keep improving this, but I also want to take a moment to say thank you to all those involved.The third strand is about future supply, which is making sure we have enough PPE to see us through the crisis. We are using up PPE on an unprecedented scale, so we are constantly buying more from abroad and now making it at home.Our PPE sourcing unit is securing new supply lines from across the world, ensuring that what we buy meets rigorous standards. This includes teams from the Foreign Office and the Department of International Trade, out in the Far East especially, buying directly from manufacturers, and teams in Whitehall focused on rapid freight operations to get it here. We’ve published the standards that we’ll buy against, along with our global shopping list.And it’s also about ramping up domestic production as well. Going into the crisis, we did not have a major domestic PPE manufacturing industry. So, like with ventilators and testing, we’re creating one.Many businesses have generously come forward with offers to turn over their production lines as part of this national effort. In particular, I want to thank Burberry, with their offers of gowns; Rolls-Royce and McLaren, who are creating visors; Ineos and Diageo, who are producing hand sanitiser. We’re talking to many others and we want more to step up to the plate.So, if you’ve got production facilities and you can meet our published technical specifications, we want to hear from you so we can make this kit here in Britain that will keep people safe. This is our comprehensive PPE plan to protect the people who protect us to make sure they have the kit they need to do their jobs safely and with confidence.But, I want to finish by saying this. Even if you’re not directly involved in the NHS, in the PPE supply chain, in testing or as a key worker, there is something that everyone of us can do to play your part in the national effort.Stay at home.Because spreading the virus today risks lives tomorrow. And it increases pressure on those who work in the NHS.Do it for them. Do it for the people who you love.The more we follow the rules, the faster we can lift these restrictions and get back towards normal life. Thank you to all those of you who are already doing your bit as part of our national effort.Stay well, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."
Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-9-april-2020,Foreign Secretary,2020-04-09,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 9 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 9 April 2020.Good afternoon, welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m joined by Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer and Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser.Can I start with an update on the Prime Minister. He is still in intensive care but he continues to make positive steps forward and he’s in good spirits.I can also report from the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme that, as of today:243,421 people have now been tested for the virus  65,077 have tested positive, and  the number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms now stands at 16,784  of those who have contracted the virus, 7,978 have sadly died and our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friendsThe whole country has been practicing a stringent form of social distancing for 3 weeks now. Precisely because we’re doing everything we can to minimise the bleak numbers that I just read out and, for that, I want to say a massive thank you to everyone who has gone the extra mile during this very challenging period.Thank you to all of those who are looking after us in our time of need.The NHS workers on the front line who have treated the sick, saved lives and tended for those who, sadly, could not be saved.For the doctors and nurses who have died of coronavirus whilst caring for others, we will never forget their sacrifice, we will never forget their devotion to helping others.And I also want to say a big thank you to the carers, the charity workers, all those who are looking after, or even just keeping an eye on, those in their local neighbourhood. You are the lifeline to so many people in our communities.Thank you to the workers who keep the country running, the supermarket workers, the delivery drivers, the technicians, the cleaners, the public servants who just kept going, determined to keep providing the daily services we all rely on.I think you’ve certainly made us all think long and hard about who the ‘key workers’ are in our lives.Thank you to the volunteers who have stepped up across the country, whose big-hearted sense of responsibility defines British community spirit at its very best.And a massive thank you to every single person who has stayed home to stop this terrible virus from spreading, you have helped protect the NHS, and you have helped to save lives.Now, as we look forward to the long bank-holiday Easter weekend, I know some people are going to start wondering is it time to ease up on the rules.So I’ve got to say thank you for your sacrifice. But, also, we’re not done yet. We must keep going.Let me just explain a little bit about why that is so important.Today, I chaired a COBR meeting with senior ministers, officials and representatives from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as the Mayor of London, so that we could take stock and assess where we are right across the United Kingdom. And at this stage, the government is continuing to gather all of the relevant data to obtain the fullest picture possible of the effect of the social distancing measures we have put in place.Now, while the early signs suggest that they are having the impact we need to see, it’s too early to say that conclusively.SAGE will meet next week to discuss the latest evidence, and we will keep the measures we have put in place under review. And as we’ve said on many occasions now, we will be guided by the science at all times. So we don’t expect to be able to say more on this until the end of next week.Let me just be, again, very clear about this. The measures will have to stay in place, until we’ve got the evidence that clearly shows we have moved beyond the peak.I know these restrictions take their toll, day in day out. On people’s livelihoods, on people’s quality of life, on people’s mental health. And I appreciate that it’s often the little things that hurt the most.With the Easter bank holiday coming up, I would normally spend it with my 2 boys, 7- and 5-year-old boys, with their grandparents doing an Easter egg hunt. And I know there is going to be lots of people who would normally be planning a family get together or just getting out in the sunshine with friends and loved ones.Unfortunately, right now, we just can’t do those sorts of things. And I am really sorry about that.But take a moment to think of the progress we’ve already made, Following the guidance, staying home, denying this virus what it needs, to spread more easily and to kill more people.It’s been almost 3 weeks, and we’re starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we’ve all made. But the deaths are still rising, and we haven’t yet reached the peak of the virus. So it’s still too early to lift the measures that we’ve put in place. We must stick to the plan. And we must continue to be guided by the science.Our top priority, our immediate priority, remains to slow the spread of the virus and to save as many lives as possible. That’s why we have to ask you to continue to ask you all to keep complying with the guidance. As we’ve said consistently from the outset, it is vital we take the right decisions at the right time.And the most important thing right now is that people continue to follow the government’s guidance until we’ve got the evidence that the virus is firmly under control. So that means please do stay at home, to protect our NHS and to save lives. After all the efforts that everyone’s made, after all the sacrifices so many people have made, let’s not ruin it now.Let’s not undo the gains we’ve made. Let’s not waste the sacrifices so many people have made. We mustn’t give the coronavirus a second chance to kill more people and hurt our country. I know it’s tough going. But this is a team effort, and we’ll only defeat this virus for good if we all stay the course.So please stay home this bank holiday weekend. For everyone’s sake.Read guidance on staying at home (social distancing) and find out more about what you can and cannot do.

Chancellor's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 8 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rishi-sunak-on-economic-support-for-the-charity-sector,Chancellor,2020-04-08,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 8: April 2020Coronavirus press conference 8 April 2020.Good afternoon.I’m joined today by Steve Powis, Medical Director of the NHS, and Angela Mclean, Deputy Government Chief Scientific Adviser.Let me start by reminding everyone about our step-by-step action plan to defeat coronavirus.At every step of this process, we have followed the latest scientific and medical advice.Our goal is to slow the spread of the virus and protect the ability of the NHS to cope.We’ve taken unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity, with more beds, more staff and more equipment on the front line.And we have told people to stay at home, so that we can protect lives and protect the NHS.Today’s daily figures show that:    232,708 people in the UK have now been tested for coronavirus        60,734 people have tested positive, an increase of 5,492 cases since yesterday        19,438 people have been admitted to hospital        and sadly, of those in hospital, 7,097 have now died – an increase of 938 fatalities since yesterday  Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have passed away.People I’m sure will also want an update on the Prime Minister’s health. Heis receiving excellent care from the NHS team at St Thomas’s.The latest from the hospital is that the Prime Minister remains in intensive care, where his condition is improving.I can also tell you that he has been sitting up in bed and engaging positively with the clinical team.The Prime Minister is not only my colleague, my boss but my friend; my thoughts are with him and his family.The news about the PM reminds us how indiscriminate this disease is.Nearly everyone in the country will know someone who has been affected – friends, family, neighbours, colleagues.This is a terrible virus that respects no boundaries of status or geography or vocation.But we are not facing it alone.We are all taking part in a collective national effort to protect the vulnerable and each other, to secure our public services, and to save lives.This endeavour is underpinned by an important, simple idea – that we depend on each other.When you need it, when you fall on hard times, we will all, as one society, be there for you.To take care of you, until you are, once again, ready to take care of yourself and others.This idea has been central to all of our efforts to support people and businesses during this crisis.We promised to do whatever it takes, and I am striving every day to keep that promise.But when I say that we all depend on each other, I don’t just mean the relationship between individuals, businesses and the state.One of our greatest strengths as a country is our civil society.The local charities who provide so much compassion, care and community to the most vulnerable in our country.You have not been forgotten.British people, businesses and foundations are already doing their part to support our charity sector.And today, we in government will do our part, as we build on our plan for the economy with a plan to support our social fabric.There are nearly 170,000 charities in this country; and the truth is that we will not be able to match every pound of funding they would have received this year.Charities can already use many of our existing schemes to support people and protect their staff.All charities are eligible for the job retention scheme, and in line with medical advice, and just like any other employer……the right answer for many charities will be to furlough their employees..But some charities are on the front line of fighting the coronavirus, and others provide critical services and support to vulnerable people and communities.For them, shutting up shop at this moment would be to contravene their very purpose; their entire reason to exist.Those charities have never been more needed than they are now; and they’ve never faced such a sudden fall in their funding.So today I am announcing £750 million of funding for the charity sector.£370 million of that funding will support small, local charities working with vulnerable people.We all know who they are; those small charities in our villages, our market towns, in pockets of our cities……the unsung heroes looking after the vulnerable and holding together our social fabric.In England, this support will be provided through organisations like the National Lottery Communities Fund.And we will allocate £60 million of this funding through the Barnett formula to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The UK government will also provide £360 million directly to charities providing essential services and supporting vulnerable people, as we battle the coronavirus.Up to £200 million of those grants will support hospices……with the rest going to organisations like St Johns’ Ambulance and the Citizens Advice Bureau……as well as charities supporting vulnerable children, victims of domestic abuse, or disabled people.And last night the BBC announced their Big Night In charity appeal on April 23rd……and today I can confirm that the government will match pound for pound whatever the public decides to donate……starting with at least £20 million to the National Emergencies Trust appeal.Two short weeks ago I spoke of the need for kindness, decency and the sort of neighbourliness that is at the heart of these charitable and community efforts.The normally invisible connections between us have, in recent weeks, become more apparent.For most of us, we spend our lives oblivious to these connections, these bonds, and how our behaviours, however small, can have a dramatic effect on others.But these bonds are not invisible for our local charities.For the volunteer keeping victims of domestic violence safe.For the outreach worker helping a rough sleeper find a bed.Or for the support worker manning the phones to help stave off the heart wrenching loneliness so many of our elderly relatives and friends will be experiencing right now.These connections might be hard to see, but they are there, and they are strengthened by our compassion for others.Charities embody this like no other organisation.And their lesson is that the simplest acts have the potential to change lives.At this time, when many are hurting and tired and confined, we need the gentleness of charities in our lives.It gives us hope.It makes us stronger.And it reminds us: we depend on each other.Thank you.Concluding peroration - post Q&AToday was about supporting charities, who are a critical part of the social fabric of this country.It builds on the economic plan we’ve already announced:To protect people’s health and economic security, by supporting public services like our NHS, backing business, and protecting people’s jobs and incomes.And I would conclude by saying this:Our economic plan, and the plan for charities I have announced today, are built on one simple idea: that we depend on each other.Thank you."
Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 7 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-7-april-2020,Foreign Secretary,2020-04-07,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 7 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 7 April 2020.Good afternoon, welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m joined by Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and our Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty.Before we get on to the detail, can I first give an update on the condition of the Prime Minister. I know a lot of people will be concerned about that.I can tell you he is receiving the very best care from the excellent medical team at St Thomas’ hospital. He remained stable overnight, he’s receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any assistance. He has not required mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support. He remains in good spirits and, in keeping with usual clinical practice, his progress continues to be monitored closely in critical care.We will give further updates on the Prime Minister’s condition, when there are any material developments.And I know that there’s been a groundswell of messages of support from people here at home, from leaders around the world and I know that everyone will want to join with me in wishing the Prime Minister a very swift recovery.As you will know, the Prime Minister asked me to deputise for him whilst he recovers. In line with the Prime Minister’s instructions, this morning I chaired the meeting of senior ministers tackling coronavirus and this afternoon I chaired an update for members of the Cabinet.And I think it’s probably worth just worth remembering that, as will be the case for so many people up and down the country, who knows someone at work at work who has fallen ill with coronavirus, it comes as a shock to all of us. He’s not just the Prime Minister, and for all of us in Cabinet he’s not just our boss, he’s also a colleague and he’s also our friend.So, all of our thoughts and prayers are with the Prime Minister at this time, with Carrie and with his whole family.And I’m confident he’ll pull through because if there’s one thing I know about this Prime Minister, he’s a fighter and he’ll be back at the helm leading us through this crisis in short order. And for us in the Cabinet, we know exactly what he wants from us and what he expects from us right now.And following the Cabinet discussion today,  I can reassure the Prime Minister, and we can reassure the public, that his team will not blink, and we will not flinch from the task at hand at this crucial moment. We will keep all of our focus and all of our resolve, with calm determination on delivering the government’s plan to defeat the coronavirus.And it’s with that objective and that unity of purpose, that Cabinet turned to business today.We had reports from the 4 Ministerial Groups on the action we’re taking across all of the strategic priority areas: including NHS capacity, procurement of ventilators and personal protective equipment, then delivery of public services including social care, on the economy and our support for both businesses and workers, and of course on the international action we’re taking to reinforce our efforts on all of the home front.As we’ve explained before, our action plan aims to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, and that will help us protect the NHS’s ability to cope. At every step, we have been following the scientific advice, the medical advice, and we’ve been very deliberate in our actions that we’ve taken, so that we take the right steps at the right moment in time.We are increasing our NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the number of beds, key staff, life-saving equipment on the front-line, so people have the care they need when they need it most. As we’ve consistently said, we are instructing people to stay at home, so we can protect the NHS and so that we can save lives.So today I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme that, as of today:    213,181 people have now been tested for the coronavirus        55,242 people have tested positive        the number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms now stands at 18,589        of those who have contracted the virus, 6,159 have, I am very sorry to say, died  Every death in this pandemic is a tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones grieving at what must be an incredibly difficult time.I think these figures reinforce that the single most important thing we can all do right now, in this national effort to defeat the virus, is to keep on following the government’s advice to:stay at home  protect our NHS  and save lives      Media enquiries            For journalists                                   Email              newsdesk@fco.gov.uk"
Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 6 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-6-april-2020,Foreign Secretary,2020-04-06,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 6 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 6 April 2020.Good afternoon, welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press conference. I’m joined by our Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, Chris it’s good to have you back. And also by Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser Angela Maclean.And before Angela gives us an update on the data, I would like to update you on the steps that the government is taking to defeat the coronavirus.Our step-by-step action plan is aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, and that will protect the NHS’s ability to cope. At each point, we have been following scientific and medical advice and we’ve been very deliberate in our actions, taking the right measures at the right moment.We are taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity, by dramatically expanding the numbers of beds, key staff and equipment on the front-line, to give people the care they need, when they need it most. That is also why we are instructing people to stay at home, so we can protect our NHS and save lives.I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:    208,837 people have now been tested for the virus        51,608 have tested positive        the number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms now stands at 17,911        and of those who have contracted the virus 5,373 sadly have died  Our thoughts, our deepest condolences are with their loved ones at this very difficult time.These figures are a powerful reminder of why we need everyone to follow the government’s guidance. We must stay at home, to protect our NHS and to save lives.As you will know, last night, the Prime Minister was admitted to hospital for tests following advice from his doctor. This was a precautionary step, because he continues to have persistent coronavirus symptoms, ten days after first having tested positive for the virus.I can tell you that the PM had a comfortable night in hospital, and he’s in good spirits. He’s still in hospital under observation. He is being given regular updates on developments, and he continues to lead the government.I can reassure the British people that the government remains united in a single overriding priority, which is to defeat the coronavirus and see this nation through the challenge ahead.In the last week under the Prime Minister’s leadership:    the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove has explained what we are doing to boost manufacturing capability here at home, to meet the rising demand for ventilators and other equipment in the NHS        Business Secretary Alok Sharma has been setting what the government is doing to support small businesses        and yesterday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave an update on what we are doing to bolster capacity in the NHS, including increasing the number of critical care beds  The FCO is supporting all of these operational priorities.So we’re deploying the diplomatic network right around the world, to source and buy ventilators and protective equipment, so that we can reinforce the NHS frontline here at home.At the same time, we’re working with other governments and the airlines to bring home as many stranded British nationals as we possibly can, prioritising our most vulnerable citizens.On commercial flights we’ve helped over 200,000 UK nationals come home from Spain, 13,000 from Egypt, 8,000 from Indonesia.We’ve also chartered flights from 7 different countries, bringing home more than 2,000 British nationals.We’ve repatriated a further 1,550 from cruise ships, including most recently the Coral Princess and the Zaandam.And for those travellers still stuck abroad, we’re doing everything we can to keep international airports open, to keep commercial flights running, and to charter flights, when there are no other options – under the new arrangements I announced last week, and which have now been agreed with 14 airlines.We’ve allocated £75 million to support those arrangements. We’ve already had flights back from countries including Peru, Ghana, and Tunisia.And we’re fixing further flights from India, South Africa, Nepal and the Philippines, which will fly later on this week.So, I want to reassure people that every arm of government is doing everything it possibly can to defeat coronavirus and rise to the challenges it presents us at home and abroad.Last night, Her Majesty the Queen reflected on the national spirit of unity and resolve that we are seeing in our country, as well as the collective effort we need to tackle the disease. From our heroic doctors, nurses and careworkers, through to those manning the tills at supermarkets and pharmacies, those driving the lorries and the buses. They are all worthy of our applause, they are all worthy of our admiration.And on that note, both the Prime Minister and I would like to thank all the NHS staff for their truly heroic work and we urge the public to continue to follow the government’s advice to:stay at home  protect the NHS  and save livesAnd on that note, I will pass over to Angela for an update on the latest data.Read the government’s coronavirus (COVID-19) travel advice.

Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-april-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-04-05,"Coronavirus press conference: 5 April 2020Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press conference. I’m joined today by our Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries.The government is working through our action plan, which aims to save as many lives as possible by slowing the spread of the virus, protecting the NHS and preventing it from being overwhelmed.Our response is built upon the bedrock of the best possible scientific and medical advice, so that we can take the right steps at the right time.First, by slowing the spread of the virus across our society. And second, by boosting the capacity of the NHS so that we can always care for those who fall sick. Sadly, coronavirus continues to spread.I can report that, through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, according to the latest figures:195,524 people have now been tested for the virus  and 47,806 have been tested positiveAcross the UK, the number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms is now 16,702. And, of those who have contracted the virus, 4,934 have, sadly, died.We mourn their passing, and we offer our profound sympathies to their family and friends. I have lost 2 people that I was fond of. So I understand what a difficult time this is for the country.This evening, Her Majesty the Queen will give a rare formal address to the nation. And I know we will all be watching and listening to see and hear what she has to say on behalf of us all.I understand that people are yearning to know how long this will all last. And the answer is entirely dependent on how much people follow the rules on social distancing.Following these rules is mission critical if we are to protect the NHS, slow the spread and give the NHS time to expand capacity and so save lives.The more people follow the rules, then the faster we will all be through it.So, I say this to the small minority of people who are breaking the rules or pushing the boundaries. You are risking your own life, and the lives of others. And you are making it harder for us all.We’ve included exercise as one of the things that you can leave your house to do, because exercise is good for our physical and mental health. But, please do not bend or break this rule. We can’t rule out further steps. But, I don’t want anyone to think that any changes to the social distancing rules are imminent, because the vast majority are following the rules.And to you, to all those at home, to all those following the rules, I want to say thank you, on behalf of us all. And especially on behalf of the doctors and nurses and other colleagues who put their lives on the line to care for you in the NHS. As well as working to slow the spread, of course, we are increasing the capacity of the NHS.Last week, we saw the completion of the Nightingale Hospital in East London. It was planned, constructed and fully staffed within 9 days. It was humbling to see  the NHS, the military and everyone involved in its construction pulling together in this time of need. And there are many more Nightingales to come across our entire United Kingdom, including Harrogate, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Belfast and Cardiff.These new hospitals are on top of the expansion in critical care across the NHS. There are currently over 2,336 spare critical care beds for the NHS in England. And over 9,000 ventilators are now available to NHS coronavirus patients across the country, thanks to the national effort to ramp up capacity. 300 new ventilators arrived this weekend from China. And we’ve seen UK manufacturers working at pace to develop new ones.Of course, hospitals and ventilators are critical, but our NHS is nothing without the people who work there. And it has been so encouraging to see over 27,000 former healthcare professionals signing up to return to the NHS frontline. I want to say a great big thank you to each and every one of you – welcome back. And I hope many more will sign up in the weeks ahead.This weekend, we have also launched our latest technology – a new coronavirus status checker. It asks people who currently have coronavirus symptoms to share their experiences to help us in our fight against the virus. And it will help make use of this information, which will in turn help us to understand the disease. So we can for instance allocate resources – like oxygen, ventilators and additional staff – to where they are needed most.Please do your bit, if you currently have symptoms, by going to www.nhs.uk/statuschecker. Because, the more people who use it, then the better informed our response will be. The smart use of data like this and digital technologies is one of the strongest bulwarks that we have against coronavirus. Because new technologies can help us to meet these new threats, and allow us to gain the understanding and the insight that we need to defeat this virus once and for all.Technology is one piece of the jigsaw, and an important piece. But, ultimately, the strongest weapon in our arsenal is if we join together in tough times and follow the rules that have been put in place. I, like many of you, have young children at home, so I know what a challenge this can be for families. And I really understand how much everyone wants to enjoy the sunny weather. But, the cruel thing about coronavirus is it thrives on the social contact and the human bonds that bring so much to life.So, we must show our resolve. All the things that we miss right now – going to the pub for a pint with friends, or sitting in the park with a book, or hugging a grandchild – we will have these moments again and they’ll mean even more to us.But until then, the only way to protect yourselves, your loved ones and your community is to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 4 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-duchy-of-lancaster-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-4-april-2020,Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 4 April 2020,2020-04-04,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 4 April 2020:Coronavirus press conference 4 April 2020.Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our daily briefing in the fight against Covid-19.I am joined today by Professor Steve Powis, Medical Director of NHS England.I’d like first to update you on the facts about the spread of the coronavirus,Then I will outline why it is so critical that we continue to observe the rules on social distancing.Thirdly, I will explain what we are doing to increase the capacity of the NHS to deal with this disease.And finally, I want to say something about how we can all work together to defeat this invisible enemy.First, the facts as they stand today.As of 9am today, a total of 183,190 people have been tested, of which 41,903 tested positive.15,073 people in England have been admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms.But the pattern of hospital admissions in England and Wales has regional differences.In London, the number of admissions fell slightly between the 1st and 2nd of April.Admissions are steady in Wales.But in Yorkshire and the North East they have gone up by 35% and in the Midlands, the rate of hospital admissions has gone up by 47%.708 people have sadly lost their lives as a result of Covid-19: the highest daily total yet recorded.And that means that of those hospitalised in the UK, the number who have passed away now totals 4,313.Those numbers emphasise again the importance of maintaining social distancing measures to halt the spread of the disease.More than ever, we must ‘stick with it’, as the Prime Minister said in his video message.Now I know that life under lockdown can be challenging. Some will be tempted, on this sunny weekend, to venture out and about.But, as the Health Secretary underlined, yesterday, if we relax our adherence to the rules we increase the risk for others.That’s why it is so important to stay at home. Protect the NHS. And to save lives.We need to think of those on the frontline, and the sacrifices that they are making for us. As the Chief Nursing Officer for England reminded us yesterday.Ruth May asked us to remember two NHS nurses who died after contracting Covid-19.Areema Nasreen, who was just 36, and Aimee O’Rourke, aged 39, each had three young children.They died while doing everything they could to help the sick and suffering.We can all best honour them by playing our part in fighting the disease by staying at home and slowing the spread.Seven healthcare professionals have now lost their lives to Covid-19 and we offer our heartfelt condolences to their grieving families - and to the many others mourning the loss of loved ones.They include the family of Ismail Mohamed Adbdulwahab, who died aged just 13 in King’s College Hospital in London.His mother and siblings are showing symptoms of the virus, and they were unable to say their final goodbyes at his funeral. In their despair, the loving, dignified tributes from Ismail’s parents are truly haunting.Our thoughts today are also with the family of the five-year-old child with underlying health conditions who has tragically died.So again: you must stay at home, to protect the NHS and to save lives.Whatever the temptation this weekend please don’t go outside, to the lakes, the beaches or the countryside.Take pride instead in keeping your own families and communities safe.The more we restrict contact, the more we slow the spread of the infection – and the more time we have to build capacity in the NHS so that we can treat those who are most in need.And I want now to outline how we are increasing NHS capacity.Yesterday we were grateful to HRH the Prince of Wales, himself recently recovered from Coronavirus, for opening the brand new Nightingale Hospital in east London, a testament to brilliant teamwork and determined leadership from the NHS.Two weeks of hard work have transformed a convention hall into a fully-functioning field hospital that can treat 500 COVID-19 patients on ventilators or through oxygenation.New Nightingale hospitals are due to be built in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Belfast, Glasgow, Harrogate, and Manchester.And given we now know that the Midlands are a particular area of concern, the NHS and the military are accelerating their existing work to transform the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham into a 2000-bed Nightingale Hospital. I have spoken to the mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, earlier today and he is doing all he can with the NHS, to accelerate that work.Of course, a critical part of ensuring the NHS is resilient is improving the testing of staff. 10,984 tests were administered yesterday – and as the Health Secretary outlined on Thursday we have a strategy to increase that number to 100,000 a day.Testing is a critical part of the clinical pathway that we all follow in seeking to reduce the impact of COVID-19.But the next vital step is appropriate pharmaceutical treatment.That is why as the Health Secretary explained clinical trials are now taking place to see if anti-virals which have helped in the fight against HIV, and anti-malarial medicines such as hydroxychloroquine, can reliably reduce the harm the coronavirus inflicts.The next stage in the clinical pathway is ensuring those patients with impaired lung functions get the oxygen they need – and this is where ventilation comes in.We have been working to increase the ventilator capacity across the NHS.Ventilation can be non-invasive and invasive.Effective non-invasive ventilation can ensure patients do not need to be placed on invasive ventilators – where they are intubated and supported to breathe with machinery which takes oxygen direct into their lungs.We have secured new non-invasive capacity with the help of UK manufacturers who have worked at pace to develop new technologies. A team from University College London working with Mercedes Benz have produced a new device which has been clinically approved. They produced 215 yesterday, have produced the same number today and tomorrow, rising to 1,000 a day next week.We are also increasing the capacity of the NHS to deploy invasive ventilation.We have been buying invasive ventilators from partners abroad, including Germany and Switzerland. And today, 300 new ventilators arrived from China. I’d like to thank the Chinese Government for their support in securing that capacity.And we have developed new sources of supply here in the UK, with existing and modified models being made in greater numbers and new models designed to come on stream soon.The first models which have been scaled up as part of the Ventilator Challenge will be coming off production lines this weekend.More are to come into operation in the coming weeks, subject to safety and regulatory approvals, as part of the Prime Minister’s call to manufacturers to scale up production.Increasing this production has involved securing supplies of critical components – from lithium ion batteries to flow regulators – from across the globe to assemble here.The first of the ventilators that the government has ordered from Penlon, a medical devices company based in Oxfordshire, will be begin arriving in hospitals this week for final clinical checks.We are grateful to the MOD personnel who will be delivering them, as we are to all the companies who have devoted time, staff and resources to fighting Covid-19.The first devices from Smiths Group have also been received at MOD Donnington, a military logistics hub in Shropshire: these have been approved by the regulator.The initial dispatch is the result of scaled-up manufacturing of an existing mechanical ventilator design - and we are grateful for the efforts of an industry consortium including GKN Aerospace and Rolls-Royce.These ventilators will be distributed to hospitals this week.And next week, UK production of another ventilator device from the companies Diamedica and Plexus will start at their factory in Kelso, in Scotland. The design is based on an existing product already in use in the NHS.The more ventilators – invasive and non-invasive – available to the NHS, the more patients can get the care they need when they need it.But the process of design, testing, assembly and manufacture does take time.We need to make sure these devices are safe and their manufacture scaleable.The challenges in increasing numbers are formidable – which is why the commitment of the scientists, engineers, designers and civil servants involved in this work is so impressive.But you don’t need to be a scientist or engineer to help them.All you need to do is observe the social distancing guidelines that have been put in place.The more we all stay at home, and slow the spread of the disease, the more time we buy for more ventilators to come on stream and for the NHS to become more resilient.Finally, I want to turn to the way in which all parts of our country are coming together to fight this invisible enemy.Teachers have kept schools open for those who need them – and parents have kept their children at home wherever possible – so we enter the Easter Holiday weeks with school attendance having been around just 2% - ensuring the most vulnerable can be cared for.For children eligible for free school meals, vouchers will be available over the holidays to support household incomes.But I am conscious more must be done – particularly over the holiday period – to support children at risk and in need, and we will be saying more next week about work in this area.I also recognise that we are asking a lot of the British people.And we in Government therefore have a responsibility to communicate as clearly as possible.Clear, factual, timely information.And an honest assessment of the difficulties we all face – as well as proper recognition of the achievements of those on the frontline who are doing so much to fight this disease.Adapting to this pandemic has meant developing guidance, implementing new policies and co-ordinating efforts across government at an unprecedented pace.Inevitably, there has therefore been criticism of some government actions.I recognise that criticism has been designed to challenge the government’s performance and improve to our response. Which is why I welcome it.Even as we unite in our efforts to defeat the virus we must also recognise that robust scrutiny is to be welcomed – and is the duty of the media.Which is why we are acting to both share robust information and support our media by investing more in our government information campaign which is being disseminated through the national media and local newspapers and radio.We will share essential health advice and information on the support packages available from the Chancellor for workers or for businesses.We will share details of how you can help volunteer to support our NHS or the vulnerable; and also how you can help British farmers by buying more locally-grown products, and we will also list dozens of other ways you can join the national effort against Coronavirus.We are using social media to reach young people, some of whom have been more reluctant than others to follow social distancing rules.And in this united national effort, where we need both constructive challenge and a shared spirit of national endeavour, we want to make sure that we all work collaboratively to help defeat the virus.That is why we have been co-ordinating daily with our colleague in the devolved administrations, why I spoke yesterday to my friends in the trade union movement Frances O’Grady and Len McCluskey and why the Prime Minister has written today to the leaders of all opposition parties, including the new leader of the Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer.I would like to congratulate Sir Keir on his victory and wish him well in his important role.And I would like again to emphasise that all of us can do our bit this weekend in that united national effortBy staying at home,Protecting the NHS,And saving lives."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-3-april-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-04-03,"Coronavirus press conference: 3 April 2020Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press briefing. I’m joined by our Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Professor Jonathan Van Tam, and by the Chief Nurse, Ruth May.Our plan is to save as many lives as possible by protecting the NHS and preventing it from being overwhelmed. And we’re doing this in 2 ways.One, by slowing the spread of the virus, and that’s why it is so important that people stay at home. And that’s true for everyone who’s watching – how important it is that we stay at home.And two, by boosting the capacity of the NHS to care for those who fall sick. That means more beds, more staff, more life-saving equipment and more effective treatments – we’ll come on to that.Coronavirus continues its grim march. I can report that, through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, according to the latest figures as of this morning:a total of 173,784 people have been tested, of whom 38,168 have tested positive  3,605 people have sadly diedWe are reminded again today that, for the NHS, this is truly the frontline. In the last 24 hours, 2 nurses and 2 healthcare assistants have tragically died fighting coronavirus. Every life lost to this dreadful disease makes me more determined than ever to push for victory.Today, I want to update you with the latest on what we’re doing to boost NHS capacity, so the capacity we have to care is always above the need for that care.First, we’re delivering more critical care beds. This morning, I attended the opening of the new Nightingale Hospital in East London, with Ruth and many others. It was planned, constructed and fully staffed in just 9 days. That is an outstanding achievement and I pay tribute to Ruth and all who have been involved in its construction.It shows what’s possible when we come together as one team, in one national effort. I pay tribute to the extraordinary work of everyone. The NHS, the military, the construction industry who both donated supplies and of course their expertise, the engineers, the electricians, the plumbers, the caterers and others, all playing their part to build a place of hope and a place of healing. It was really inspiring to go and see the sheer scale of it and the teamwork going on there.And lastly, I want to thank you. I want to thank everyone who is at home, because you are giving the NHS the time to expand so that it can save lives. By staying at home, you are saving lives.We have more Nightingale hospitals planned on the way in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. And today we’ve announced that we will begin the work on 2 further Nightingale hospitals in Bristol and Harrogate. The Bristol Nightingale will have a capacity of up to 1,000 beds, and in Harrogate a capacity of up to 500.The Nightingale hospitals are not the only expansion we’ve seen across the NHS. Since the start of this crisis, we’ve boosted the number of critical care beds to care for coronavirus by over 2,500 – that’s before the addition we’ll get from the Nightingale hospitals.And the result of this extraordinary work is that, in every hospital in the country, we have managed to expand capacity and, as we stand today, over 2,000 critical care beds are free and available and are ready should they be needed, and that’s before the Nightingale hospitals come on stream.And of course we are working round the clock to deliver essential deliveries of PPE across the whole NHS, social care, key public services, and in all 4 nations of the UK. Yesterday, more than 26 million PPE products were delivered to 281 different organisations, and I have agreed with the Northern Ireland Executive that we will immediately be providing more PPE to Northern Ireland to meet their needs. Over 5 million items, including goggles, aprons and masks.Over 7,000 NHS staff have now been tested. And next, alongside testing, we’re intensively researching drugs and treatments. Right since the start of this crisis, we’ve been clear that all our plans are based on the best possible science. And that science gets better every day, but there is still a lot that we don’t know about how to treat and potentially prevent COVID-19.So, research about treatments is absolutely central to our plan. The UK of course has a long tradition that we are very proud of, of being the best in the world in this sort of science and we are a world leader in clinical trials. We are putting this to use right now, bringing together some of the finest research minds in the country to design new trials and we are delivering them at record pace.We’ve established 3 national clinical trials covering each major stage of the disease: primary care, hospital care and critical care for the most seriously ill. And, just like the Nightingale, one of these trials was in fact put together in just 9 days, which is breath-taking speed. These trials are looking at the effect of existing drugs and steroids, repurposed for treatment of COVID-19.One of the trials – called ‘Recovery’, which deals in hospital care – is the largest of its kind in the world, with 926 patients enrolled. We’ve also set up an expert Therapeutics Task Force to search for and shortlist other candidate medicines for trials. And I’m advised on that work by my brilliant colleague Jonathan Van Tam the Deputy Chief Medical Officer – who is one of the finest research scientists of his generation, and Jonathan will say a bit more about this in a few minutes.We need more patients to volunteer to be part of these trials, because the bigger the trials, the better the data, and the faster we can roll out the treatments if – and only if – it’s proven to work.These treatments will help us as the science develops, but, for now, the only way to protect yourself and your family from this disease is to stay at home.And of course, while this is a national effort to find these treatments, it’s also an international effort. In the same way that we have donated more money to the global search for a vaccine than any other country, so too we will lead the world in this science of treatments and whatever we learn, we will share, because we are all on the same side in this war.Earlier today, I spoke to my counterparts in the G7 to co-ordinate our research efforts over this and other things. And whether it’s treatments, or equipment, or NHS capacity, we will strain every sinew. We will move whatever mountains need to be moved. We need everyone to keep playing their part, and that includes you. The only way to protect yourselves and others now is to stay at home.And the one final thing I want to say is this. We are set for a warm weekend in some parts of the country, but the disease is still spreading, and we absolutely cannot afford to relax the social distancing measures that we have in place. We cannot relax our discipline now. If we do, people will die.So, I end with the advice we all know. This advice is not a request. It is an instruction. Stay at home, protect lives, and then you will be doing your part."
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 2 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-2-april-2020,Health and Social Care Secretary,2020-04-02,"Coronavirus press conference: 2 April 2020Good afternoon.Welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press briefing.I’m joined by our National Medical Director of NHS England, Professor Steve Powis, and Professor John Newton from Public Health England.Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of the virus so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the NHS’s ability to cope.At each point, we have been following scientific and medical advice and been deliberate in our actions – taking the right steps at the right time.We are also taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the numbers of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment to the frontline to give people the care they need when they need it most.I’ve been away for a week now and I’m delighted to be back.In the past week, we have completed the construction of a whole new hospital, NHS Nightingale, built in 9 days.With 4,000 beds, this will be the equivalent of 10 district general hospitals.And there’s more to come in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, where the military has been working wonders in helping to construct.This has been an incredible achievement and I want to thank all of those involved.And I also want to thank those people who have followed the social distancing with admirable fortitude and spirit. Steve will update us on the progress that’s been made.Third, I want to pay huge tribute to all those in councils, primary care and community care, pharmacies and the unbelievable 750,000 volunteers who have signed up to shielding the most vulnerable.This is Britain at its best.Sadly, the coronavirus continues to grow.I can report that, through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, according to the latest figures:163,194 people have now been tested for the virus  and 33,718 have tested positiveThe best scientific analysis is that the rate of infection has been doubling every 3 or 4 days.The number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms is now 12,949.Of those who have contracted the virus, 2,921 have, sadly, died. We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of these victims.If the past few weeks have shown anything, it is that we are steadfast as a country in our resolve to defeat this invisible killer.I am profoundly moved by the compassion and the commitment that we are seeing from people across the country.And, in the health and care system, we have lost colleagues too – doctors, nurses and mental health professionals. They have paid the ultimate price for their service, working to care for others.I just want to say this on my behalf of all my colleagues in health and social care.I am awed by the dedication of my colleagues on the frontline – every single person who contributes to the running of this diverse and caring institution that our nation holds so dear. These were people who came to this country to make a difference. And they did. And they have given their lives in service, in sacrifice. We salute you.And I tell you this. I will fight this virus with everything I have got. And we still strain every sinew to defeat it once and for all. I will stop at nothing to make sure that frontline staff have the right equipment so that they are safe and can have the confidence they need to do their jobs.And I know that people have asked questions about protective equipment.With the support of the British military, we have shipped record quantities of equipment to the frontline.Just yesterday, 45 million pieces of protective equipment were delivered across health and social care, including more than 5 million aprons and 6 million surgical masks.Today, Public Health England have announced the upgraded PPE standards that people should use and expect.The upgraded guidance has been developed through intense consultation with stakeholders across the board and staff on the frontline. We have listened and put the interests of our healthcare staff first and put them at the heart of this.This guidance recommends the appropriate level of PPE to protect people in all different circumstances.These standards are among the highest in the world and in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization. I am delighted that they have been welcomed by the medical royal colleges, the BMA, the Royal College of Nursing and the trade unions.Any health or care organisation that needs PPE should call the hotline so that our military operation for delivering PPE can get that protective equipment to you.These are unprecedented times for our health and care services. And I want to make sure every part of our health and care system is supported.I have therefore made £300 million available for funding for community pharmacies, who do so much to get people vital medicines. And are themselves on the NHS frontline.And today, to help NHS trusts to deliver what’s needed without worrying about past finances, I can announce that I am writing off over £13.4 billion of historic NHS debt.This landmark step will not only put the NHS in a stronger position to respond to this global coronavirus pandemic, but will also provide our NHS with stronger foundations as we recover.But this is only one part of the picture.And I understand why people are yearning for the certainty that good-quality testing can provide. I get it.Public Health England can be incredibly proud of the world-beating work they have been doing on testing.The roll-out of its COVID-19 diagnostic test is the fastest deployment of a novel test in recent history, including the swine flu pandemic in 2009.But I am going to level with you about the challenges we face and the plan we have to rise to that challenge.I am going to go through some of the challenges in very specific detail. And then talk about the plan we have to drive this forward with a significant increase in testing.First, unlike some countries, we didn’t go into this crisis with a huge diagnostics industry. We have the best scientific labs in the world, but we do not have scale. My German counterpart for instance could call upon a hundred test labs, ready and waiting when the crisis struck – thanks to Roche, one of the biggest diagnostics companies in the world.We have had to build from that lower base.Next, there is the demand for materials. There has been a shortage of both swabs and reagents. Thanks to the ingenuity of my team, we have fixed the swabs issue, and we are tackling the shortage of reagents.We are solving this reagents issue, but, as the head of Roche and the President of the United States have commented, this is a global challenge. I am sure we will get there.Next, there is the challenge of prioritisation.I understand why NHS staff want tests so they can get back to the frontline. Of course I do.But I took the decision that the first priority has to be patients for whom the result of the test can lead to a difference in treatment. That is the difference between life and death. I believe anybody in my shoes would have made the same decision.I am proud that every single patient who has needed a test for life-saving treatment has had access to a test.But of course NHS staff need access to testing too. And I am delighted that at the weekend we could roll this access out for the first time.And there is the challenge of making sure that the public can have confidence in the tests.Several of the tests that we are currently checking have failed. In one case, a test that I am being urged to buy missed 3 out of 4 positive cases of coronavirus.That means in three-quarters of cases that test would have given the false comfort of sending someone with coronavirus back on the wards. Approving tests that don’t work is dangerous and I will not do it.Now I want to set out my plan to boost testing.Let us be clear about the goal.Firstly, always to ensure that testing is available for patients who need it.Next, to expand testing of critical NHS staff and their families. And I can announce today that we are expanding testing for NHS staff further.Third, as we ramp up the numbers, we will test critical key workers.And, over time, we will expand testing to the community.Our ultimate goal is that anyone who needs a test should have one. Now let me take a moment to set out my 5-pillar testing strategy to achieve these goals.The first pillar is swab testing in PHE labs and NHS hospitals. This is the testing to find out if you currently have the virus.We have already reached our target of 10,000 tests per day, precisely on time, by the end of March as committed. And we are committed to reaching 25,000 tests per day by the end of April at the latest.Because it allows the NHS to identify and effectively care for those who are most seriously ill – saving lives by helping clinicians decide the most effective treatment options. I can reassure you that every single patient who needs a test is able to have one, and this is how we’re able to provide people with the right care and treatment in hospitals.The second pillar is the creation of brand new swab testing capacity delivered by commercial partners. Again, this is swab testing to tell if people have the virus.The biggest part of pillar 2 is the partnership with universities, research institutes and companies, such as Amazon and Boots, to build from scratch a network of new labs and testing sites across the UK.This brand new service has just launched, and is ramping up rapidly. The trials of this have successfully completed and the number of tests at this facility will significantly increase this weekend.To begin with, this capacity will be used solely for frontline NHS staff and their families.Increasing testing capacity for NHS staff will allow more doctors and nurses who do not have the disease to safely go back to work and treat those who are most in need of care.These are currently in the final stages of development. As of now, over 5,000 NHS workers have been tested across 5 new testing sites.Currently only 5.7% of doctors in England are absent due to COVID-19. Of course, we want to get these numbers down.We are working with other testing companies to expand pillar 2 so that over time we have many different commercial companies delivering mass swab testing.The third pillar is blood tests.Blood tests are designed to tell whether people have had the virus and are now immune. These tests are done by taking a blood sample and looking for the presence of the right COVID-19 antibodies. These could potentially be done at home with a finger prick, and deliver results in as little as 20 minutes.We are currently working with 9 companies who are offering these tests and are evaluating their effectiveness.These antibody tests, blood tests, offer the hope that people who think they have had the disease will know they are immune and get back to life as normal. But they have got to work.The fourth pillar is surveillance. We are conducting some of the biggest surveys in the world to find out what proportion of the population have already had the virus.This is done using an ultra-high accuracy antibody test operated by Public Health England at their Porton Down science campus. We have capacity for 3,500 of these tests per week, enough for population sampling to begin with.Robust population surveillance programmes are essential to understanding the rate of infection, and how the virus is spreading across the country.We will use these tests to help us strengthen our scientific understanding and inform us all on the big choices we have to make about social distancing measures and how we exit from this crisis.We did not start this crisis with a large diagnostics industry. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t build one.Just as our top-end manufacturers have joined the national effort to build ventilators, so our pharmaceutical companies will do the same for testing. Our pharmaceutical giants, like AstraZeneca and GSK, which have no great history in diagnostics, are now working with our world leading, but small, diagnostics companies, to build a British diagnostics industry at scale.The new national effort for testing will ensure we can get tests for everyone who needs them.I am delighted that the pharmaceutical industry is rising to the challenge and putting unprecedented resources into testing.Taken together, I am now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day, by the end of this month. That is the goal and I am determined that we will get there.To drive this work forward, I’m pleased that Professor John Newton from Public Health England will be taking on a new role to lead this national effort for testing, working with my brilliant departmental officials, the NHS and the life sciences industry. Professor Newton is widely recognised as a leading voice on public health and I am thrilled that we can bring to bear his considerable experience on this vital issue.My 5 pillars represent a comprehensive plan to put in place the testing that is mission critical as we fight this battle against COVID-19.There will be problems, like those that we have already overcome. After all, building a brand new industry from scratch is not easy. There will be bumps in the road and criticisms made – some of them justified.And I return from illness more determined than ever before to fight this disease.We will bring together the best minds and the best science this country has to offer. And we will work with our friends and allies all across the world as we do so.Because we are in the midst of a war against an invisible enemy. And it is a war in which all of humanity is on the same side.And history has shown us that, when the world unites against a common foe, we will always prevail.As the Prime Minister said yesterday, mass testing is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle and defeat it in the end.But, in the meantime, while the disease is still spreading rapidly and the government builds up the ability to test on a mass scale, the most important thing to do is for people to stay at home. Protect the NHS. And save lives."
Business Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 1 April 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-1-april-2020,Business Secretary,2020-04-01,"Coronavirus press conference 1 AprilGood afternoon and thank you for joining us for the daily briefing on our fight against coronavirus.I am joined today by Dr Yvonne Doyle who is the medical director of Public Health England.Before Yvonne provides an update on the latest data from our COBR coronavirus fact file, I would like to update you on the steps that we are taking to defeat this pandemic.Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the ability of the NHS to cope.Throughout our response to coronavirus, we have been following the scientific and medical advice. We have been deliberate in our actions, taking the right steps at the right time.We are also taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the number of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment on the front-line to provide the care when people need it most.The daily figures show that a total of 152,979 people in the UK have now been tested for coronavirus.Of those, 29,474 have tested positive.The number of people admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus symptoms is now 10,767, with 3,915 of those in London and 1,918 in the Midlands.Of those hospitalised in the UK, sadly 2,352 have died. This is an increase of 563 fatalities since yesterday. The youngest of them was just 13 years old.All our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.This is more tragic evidence that this virus does not discriminate.The coronavirus pandemic is the biggest threat our country has faced in decades, and we are not alone. All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer.We recognise the extreme disruption the necessary actions we are asking people to take are having on their lives, businesses, jobs and the nation’s economy.And I want to thank everyone across our whole country for the huge effort that is being made, collectively, in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.To the frontline workers treating and caring for patients, the people delivering supplies to their neighbours, and the millions staying at home: thank you. You are protecting the NHS and saving lives.And I want to thank businesses too.Through your support for your workers and your communities, and through your willingness to support our health service, you are making a real difference.Whether it’s INEOS building a new hand sanitiser plant near Middlesbrough in just ten days;Or UCL engineers working with Mercedes Formula One to build new Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machines, which help patients to breathe more easily;Or broadband providers giving their customers unlimited data to stay connected;Or indeed London’s ExCel Centre being converted into the NHS Nightingale Hospital with space for 4,000 patients.These are just a few of the examples of businesses from across our great nation supporting lifesaving work.There are also thousands of businesses, large and small, which have worked with staff to ensure they are supported in the days and weeks ahead.Whether that is through ensuring PHE guidelines are followed on site, implementing furlough schemes, carrying over annual leave, or providing the means to work from home.I want to convey my heartfelt thanks to all of those businesses, up and down the country, which are working to keep our economy going.So that when this crisis passes, and it will, we are ready to bounce back.Our businesses are doing all they can to support our people, and I want to make it clear that government, in turn, will do all it can to support our businesses.We have taken unprecedented action to support firms, safeguard jobs and protect the economy.From today businesses will start benefiting from £22 billion in the form of business rates relief. And grants of up to £25,000 which are being paid into the bank accounts of the smallest high street firms.On Saturday, I said that we had provided funds to councils in England for grants to small businesses.As of today, these local authorities have received more than £12 billion.This afternoon I held a call with hundreds of local authorities across England and made clear that this money must reach businesses as quickly as possible. And I know that businesses across England have already started to receive these grants.We know high street banks are working really hard to support the UK through this period, including through mortgage holidays and increased credit facilities.Loans for businesses are also being issued through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme since it came into operation last week.The Chancellor, together with the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority, wrote to the chief executives of the UK banks to urge them to make sure that the benefits of the Loan Scheme are passed through to businesses and consumers.And it would be completely unacceptable if any banks were unfairly refusing funds to good businesses in financial difficulty.Just as the taxpayer stepped in to help the banks back in 2008, we will work with the banks to do everything they can to repay that favour and support the businesses and people of the United Kingdom in their time of need.Of course, this is a brand new scheme and, as with all new schemes, it will not be perfect from the outset.We are listening all the time. And in response to concerns that we’ve heard from businesses, we are looking at ways in which we can ensure they get the support they need. The Chancellor will be saying more on this in the coming days.It is crucial that when we overcome this crisis, as in time we will, that businesses are in a good position to move forward.Times are tough, and we have harder times ahead of us.But I know that together, we will pull through."
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 31 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-duchy-of-lancaster-opens-the-coronavirus-press-conference-31-march-2020,Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,2020-03-31,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 31 March 2020:Coronavirus press conference 31 March 2020.Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our daily briefing in the fight against COVID-19.I am joined today by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, and Professor Stephen Powis, the Medical Director of NHS England.I would like first to update you all on the facts about the spread of COVID-19 and the steps that we are then taking in the battle against this virus.143,186  people have now been tested for the virus.Of those, 25,150 have tested positive.And sadly, yesterday we recorded the highest single increase in the number of deaths as a result of COVID-19.381 people died, meaning that of those hospitalised in the UK,  the number who have passed away now totals 1,789.Every death is the loss of a loved one, and our thoughts and prayers are with those who are grieving.Overall, 10,767 people in England have been admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms.The largest number of those is in London, with 3,915 people in hospital care.While in the Midlands, the number of those hospitalised is now 1,918 and accelerating upwards.These numbers reinforce the vital importance of following the Government’s social distancing guidelines.The more we restrict contact, the more we slow the spread of the infection, the more that we can help the NHS build the capacity needed to care for those most in need.And that capacity is increasing.More NHS staff are returning to the frontline and more testing is taking place to help those self-isolating come back and to protect those working so hard in our hospitals and in social care.But while the rate of testing is increasing we must go further, faster.A critical constraint on the ability to rapidly increase testing capacity is the availability of the chemical reagents which are necessary in the testing.The Prime Minister and the Health Secretary are working with companies worldwide to ensure that we get the material we need to increase tests of all kinds.And as well as increasing the number of staff on the frontline, and the tests which protect them, we must also increase the capacity to provide oxygen to those worst affected by the disease.We have just over 8,000 ventilators deployed in NHS hospitals now. This number has increased since the epidemic began, thanks to the hard work of NHS professionals.But we need more.That is why we are buying more ventilators from abroad – including from EU nations.And it’s also why we are developing new sources of supply at home.Before the epidemic struck we had very little domestic manufacture of ventilators.But now, thanks to the dedication of existing medical supply companies and the ingenuity of our manufacturing base, we have existing models being produced in significantly greater numbers and new models coming on stream.Orders have been placed with consortia led by Ford, Airbus, the Formula 1 Racing teams including Mclaren, GKN Aerospace and Rolls Royce and Dysons.And I can announce that this weekend, the first of thousands of new ventilator devices will roll off the production line and be delivered to the NHS next week. From there they will be rapidly distributed to the front line.And as well as increasing the capacity for ventilation – which helps support those patients worst affected – we are also increasing the capacity to provide oxygen to affected patients at an earlier stage in the process  of the disease, helping to avert, we hope, the deterioration of their condition.A team led by UCL, working with Mercedes Benz, will produce 10,000 new CPAP devices to support affected patients and a team from Oxford University are also developing related technology.And in our determination to prevent as many patients as possible seeing their condition worsen we are conducting rapid clinical trials on those drugs, including anti-malarials, which may be able to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on those affected.But even as we seek to explore every avenue to slow the spread of the disease, to reduce its impact and to save lives, I am conscious of the sacrifices that so many are making.That is why the Chancellor’s economic package is in place – to support people through a difficult time.It is also why we we are working so closely with our colleagues in the devolved administrations to coordinate our response across the United Kingdom and I am grateful to themAs I am to the thousands of dedicated public sector workers – cleaners and social workers, prison and police officers, those in the Royal Mail and in our schools – and I want to thank them and also the leaders of the trade unions who represent them.In this united national effort we also are delivering food and prescription drugs to up to 1.5 million of the most vulnerable who are self-isolating for three months.And we will do more to help, working with the three quarters of a million people who have volunteered to help at this time. Many are already heavily involved in local community support schemes.And we want to work with them to ensure that we support not just the 1.5 million most vulnerable to the disease but all those who need our help through this crisis, those without social support, those in tough economic circumstances, those who need the visible hand of friendship at a challenging time.That is why my cabinet colleague George Eustice and the Food and Farming Minister Victoria Prentis will be leading work, with food suppliers, retailers, local authorities and voluntary groups to support our neighbours in need.I also want to thank the men and women of the military who have stepped up their work as part of the ongoing response to coronavirus.three RAF Puma helicopters are now  stationed at Kinloss Barracks in Moray. These Pumasare working closely with a Chinook and a Wildcat helicopter based at RAF Leeming, North Yorkshire, to meet any requests for assistance from NHS boards and trusts across Scotland and Northern England.A second helicopter facility covers the Midlands and Southern England working out of The Aviation Task Force Headquarters at RAF Benson in Oxfordshire. Chinook and Wildcat helicopters normally based at RAF Odiham and RNAS Yeovilton respectively support the Southern areas.And these helicopter facilities have been set up to support medical transports across Scotland and the rest of the UK. The task force is also available for general support such as moving equipment and personnel to where they are needed across the UK.The Kinloss-based support follows last weekend’s use of an RAF A400M transport aircraft, working with the Scottish Ambulance Service, to evacuate a critically ill patient from the Shetland Islands to Aberdeen to receive intensive care treatment.I am deeply grateful for everyone in the our armed forces and in the public sector who are doing so much to help in the fight against coronavirusAnd, of course, all of us can continue to play our part in supporting them and the health service bySTAYING AT HOMESUPPORTING THE NHSAND SAVING LIVES.Now I want to ask Stephen to run through the latest data from our Cabinet Office Coronavirus fact-file."
Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-30-march-2020,Foreign Secretary,2020-03-30,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 30 March 2020:Coronavirus press conference 30 March 2020.Good afternoon, welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press briefing. I’m joined by our Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance and Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England.Before Sir Patrick provides an update on the latest data from our COBR coronavirus dashboard, I just want to give you an update on the steps that we as a government are taking to defeat coronavirus.Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, thereby protecting the NHS’ capacity. At each point we have been following the scientific and medical advice and we’ve been very deliberate in our actions - taking the right steps at the right moment.We are also taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the numbers of beds, key staff, life-saving equipment on the frontline so that we give people the care they need when they need it most.That’s why we are instructing people to stay at home, so we can protect our NHS and save lives.I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:    134,946 people have now been tested for the virus        112,805 have tested negative        22,141 have tested positive  Of those who have contracted the virus, 1,408 have, very sadly, died. We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who have passed away and I think those figures are a powerful reminder to us all of the importance of following the government’s guidelines.We must stay at home to protect our NHS and save lives.I would like to thank all those involved on the frontline and in particular all of those in the NHS for their battle against the virus,  the amazing doctors, the amazing nurses and all the support staff working day and night.The thousands of other key workers – from our teachers to supermarket workers to our fantastic diplomatic network – who are all as a team working around the clock to get us through this unprecedented coronavirus challenge.This is a united national effort and the spirit of selflessness shown by so many is an inspiration.I now want to turn to what we’ve been doing to support British people travelling around the world.Coronavirus hasn’t just challenged us at home, it is the greatest global challenge in a generation. And as countries work to secure their borders and stop the further spread of this deadly virus, we appreciate that an unprecedented number of UK travellers are trying to get home, and we’re not talking a few hundred or even a few thousand. We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of people travelling around the world.So with that in mind, on 17 March, we advised people against all non-essential travel around the world.And since 23 March, we have advised that all UK residents who were currently travelling abroad should return home. Hundreds of thousands have already done so.But many travellers haven’t yet managed to get home. From young back-packers to retired couples on cruises. We appreciate the difficult predicament that they find themselves in.We also recognise the anxiety of families here in the UK, who are concerned to get their loved ones home. It is a worrying time for all those who have been affected.And I want to reassure them that this government, their government is working around the clock to support, advise and help British travellers get home.I have spoken to more than 20 foreign ministers around the world in the last week or so to support this effort, to keep airports and ports open, and to facilitate access to them by British travellers.Over the weekend, I spoke to foreign ministers from Australia, New Zealand, India and Brazil and Pakistan, and I also spoke to the Ethiopian Prime Minister, and in all of those cases urged them to work with us and keep commercial routes flying.Given the scale and the complexity of this challenge, it inevitably requires a team effort. So the Foreign Office is working with other governments, and there is a particular focus on transit hubs, and we’re also working with the airlines to keep as many flights running as possible.We have a lot more to do, but we have already helped hundreds of thousands of Britons get home.The first priority has been to keep as many commercial flights running as we can, and that’s based on just purely the scale and the number of people who want to come home.As a result of those efforts, and the cooperation we received from the Spanish government, we’ve enabled an estimated 150,000 UK nationals to get back from Spain. On other commercial routes that have come under pressure, we’ve worked with partner governments and airlines to get back 8,500 UK travellers back from Morocco and around 5,000 UK nationals from Cyprus.That gives you a sense of the scale of the challenge and the numbers of British travellers abroad.Now in circumstances where commercial flights can’t operate, we have already chartered flights, which proved necessary to return 1,400 UK nationals on flights, for example, from China at the outset of this crisis and more recently from Peru.We’ve not faced challenges in getting people home from abroad, on this scale, in recent memory. Airports are closing down or preventing airlines from operating on a commercial basis. Local authorities have placed restrictions on movement that prevent people from getting to the airport. And the critical transit hubs that we rely on for long-haul flights are also shutting down, or in some cases,  limiting their flights.Some of these restrictions have been done with very little notice, some with no notice at all which makes it very difficult to respond. So, international collaboration is absolutely vital.As I said, it is a team effort, in it involves government working with other governments and also with the airlines.So with that in mind, I can today announce a new arrangement between the government and airlines to fly home tens of thousands of stranded British travellers, where commercial flights are no longer possible. Partner airlines include British Airways, Virgin, Easyjet, Jet2 and Titan, and this list can be expanded.Under the arrangements that we are putting in place, we will target flights from a range of priority countries, starting this week.Let me explain a little bit about how this will work in practise.Where commercial routes remain an option, airlines will be responsible for getting passengers home. That means offering alternative flights at little to no cost where routes have been cancelled. And it means allowing passengers to change tickets, including between carriers.So for those still in those in countries where commercial options are still available, don’t wait. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded. The airlines are standing by to help you. Please book your tickets as soon as possible.Where commercial flights are no longer running, the government will provide the necessary financial support for special charter flights to bring UK nationals back home. Once special charter flights have been arranged, we will promote flights them through the government’s travel advice and by the British Embassy or High Commission in the relevant country.British travellers who want a seat on those flight will book and pay directly through a dedicated travel management company.We designated £75 million to support those flights and airlines to keep costs down and affordable for those seeking to return to the UK.In arranging these flights, our priority will be the most vulnerable, including the elderly or those with particularly pressing medical needs, and also looking in particular at countries where large numbers of UK tourists struggling to get home.UK travellers, if they haven’t already done so, should check Foreign Office Travel Advice and that advice is under constant review, and it can help travellers to find out more details of how to access the flights under this arrangement.They should also follow the social media of the UK embassy or high commission in the country where they find themselves, so that they can be directed to accurate real time information, including from the local authorities.For any questions that can’t be answered in that travel advice, or by the UK Embassies or High Commission, we also have our call centre working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.I know that it has been difficult for some travellers to get through. Just to give you a sense of volume: on average, we normally receive 1,000 calls a day to that call centre.  Last Tuesday, we had nearly 15,000 – the highest on record.So we’ve boosted our resources, we’ve redeployed people to assist in the call centre and we’ve tripled our capacity.Yesterday, the call centre answered 99% of calls, and helped thousands of British travellers to get the answers they need.So, for those stranded, or for families nervously waiting news and wanting to see their loved ones return home, we are doing everything we can. We have improved our advice and boosted the call centre, so travellers get better and swifter information.We have put in place this arrangement with the airlines so that we can reach British citizens in vulnerable circumstances abroad where commercial flights aren’t running. And we’re working intensively round the clock with all of our partner countries and governments around the world to keep open the airports, the ports and the flights to bring people home.We’ve not faced an international challenge quite like this before, but together we are going to rise to it.And, of course here at home, we can all support our NHS by continuing to follow the guidance to:stay at home  protect our NHS  and save livesSee also our coronavirus (COVID-19) travel advice."
Communities Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 29 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/communities-secretary-robert-jenrick-on-covid19-response,Communities Secretary,2020-03-29,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 29 March 2020:Coronavirus press conference 29 March 2020.Good afternoon,I would like to update you on our response to COVID-19.I’m joined today by Dr Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer.As of 9am today:127,737 people have now been tested for the virus.108,215 have tested negative.19,522 have tested positive.Of those who have contracted the virus, 1,228 have, sadly, died.The virus is indiscriminateIt doesn’t matter who you are, where you are or how old you are.We each have a part to play by staying at home, protecting the NHS and helping to save lives.We all have a duty to one another to keep everyone safe.So today I would like to give you two updates, before answering questions.The first on the plans I have put in place to ensure that every corner of the country can confront the coronavirus epidemic.The second on what the government is doing to shield the most vulnerable people in society.On the first question, I have put in place in all parts of the country procedures to ensure that everywhere can be ready to move forward together. All parts of the country are now on an emergency footing.This is an unprecedented step in peace time.We haven’t done anything like this since the Second World War.This means that we’re establishing strategic co-ordination centres across the whole country.Each centre is led by gold commanders.We are bringing together senior members of the emergency services    the police, the fire service, the ambulance service        with local authorities and the NHS, to lead communities through this challenging period.  From Cornwall to Cumbria.And we have embedded within each of these groups members of the armed forces  – including some of the finest military planners in the world.These groups are planning the local response to the virus.Using their expertise, their judgement and their leadership to ensure a comprehensive, a coordinated, and consistent response across the country.One issue that they have been helping us to coordinate and about which I know there is a lot of concern is the provision of personal protect equipment.We simply cannot and should not ask people to be on the frontline without the right protective equipment.We have a clear plan to ensure that those serving this country at this time have the right equipment.We have established the National Supply Distribution Response Team and they are supported now by the armed forces and other emergency services who are working round the clock to deliver the equipment to the people who need it most:170 million masks  42.8 million gloves  13.7 million aprons  182,000 gowns  almost 10 million items of cleaning equipment  and 2.3 million pairs of eye protectorsall delivered to 58,000 NHS Trusts and healthcare settings including GP surgeries, pharmacies and community providers.Every single GP practice, dental practice and community pharmacy has had a PPE delivery. All care homes, hospices and home care providers have or will shortly receive a delivery.To NHS and social care workers, all those who rely on this equipment and to their families and loved ones watching this afternoon – we understand.And we will not stop until we have got you the equipment that you need.Last weekend, at this press conference, the Prime Minister and I explained why 1.5 million people who are extremely vulnerable to the virus, due to their underlying health conditions, needed to stay at home for a period of 12 weeks and avoid face to face contact.Since then, the NHS have written to almost a million of these people and outlined the steps that they need to take to protect themselves.We have also established a dedicated web page on GOV.UK which those in receipt of a letter should go to, to let us know whether or not they need further assistance over the course of the next 12 weeks. There is also a new phone number, which is on the letter they have or will receive shortly.If this applies to you, I know that you will find this a very worrying time.You will be thinking about how you can continue to access the medicine that you need, how you can get the food and other essential supplies that you rely on.If you don’t have family or friends or neighbours nearby who you can rely on then the NHS will deliver your medicines through the community pharmacy network.And if you register online or using the phone service that we have set up, letting us know you need support, then we will deliver food and supplies to your doorstep.And this weekend I saw for myself first-hand the first deliveries being made.The packages included cereal, fruit, tinned goods, teabags, biscuits, toiletries and other essentials.The first 50,000 will have been sent out by the end of this week and we are ramping up production to send out as many as are required for as long as it takes.If this applies to you, while you will now have to be at home for a prolonged period of time and that will be difficult, I want you to know that you are not alone. We are here to support you for as long as you need us.We have all been hugely impressed by the commitment and the dedication of those working in social care, in local councils delivering essential public services like ensuring that the bins continue to get collected. None more so than me, as the Secretary of State for Local Government.We all respect the 12,000 heroic former doctors and nurses and paramedics who have come back to work and been deployed this weekend.And I think we have all been moved by the number of people who have signed up to be one of the NHS Voluntary Responders – today we can announce an extraordinary, three quarters of a million people have signed up to do that.In every city, in every town, in every village, there is going to be work to be done and in each of us there is the power to do it.And so please take part, please play your part, please consider your friends, your family, your neighbours when you are shopping, please call the elderly and support them.When this is done, and it will be done, we all want to be proud of the part that we’ve played together.Thank you very much."
Business Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 28 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-28-march-2020,Business Secretary,2020-03-28,"Coronavirus press conference 28 March 2020Good afternoon.As of 9am on 28 March, a total of 120,776 people have been tested, of which 103,687 were confirmed negative and 17,089 were confirmed positive.As of 5pm on 27 March, 1,019 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus have sadly died.As with our population, for businesses large and small, coronavirus represents an unprecedented challenge.Speaking with business leaders and representative organisations every day, I appreciate just how tough the situation is.When we tell people to “stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives”, we know it has a real cost to your families and your firms.And I want to thank the many businesses and workers, right across the UK, who are playing a vital role in keeping the British economy going.You are delivering for our nation through this difficult time and we said we would deliver for you, doing whatever it takes.That is why we have taken unprecedented action to support our economy, to save jobs and secure livelihoods.To help businesses pull through at this difficult time we have set out income support schemes, for both the employed and self-employed, as well as a package of grants, loans, business rate holidays and VAT deferrals.Businesses and trade unions have welcomed our interventions and I want to reassure them that we are working around the clock to get the funding, as quickly as possible, to where it is needed.On Monday we launched the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme.This scheme is designed to make it easier for businesses with a turnover of up to £45 million to access vital financial support.So far, the scheme’s 40 accredited lenders, including all high street banks, are processing thousands of applications.This week, I provided guidance to English councils on the grants to our smallest businesses, including those operating in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors.The first tranche of funding arrived with English councils yesterday. I want to ensure that grant money is with businesses as soon as possible, providing direct funding support to almost a million businesses across our country.Now whilst our companies have requested financial support, they have also asked us to look to ease the burden of regulation at this challenging time and we have responded to that request.Yesterday, we brought forward legislation to temporarily suspend some competition rules in the supermarkets sector and in the operation of the Isle of Wight ferries.From retailers sharing delivery vans to ferry operators coordinating staff, these measures will allow firms to work together to deliver vital services to the public more effectively at this time.We have also introduced measures to ensure that workers who have not taken all of their statutory annual leave due to COVID-19, will now be able to carry that entitlement over into the next 2 years.This will protect staff from losing out, whilst providing businesses with flexibility when they need it most.Earlier this week, together with Companies House, we announced that over 4 million businesses will be granted a 3 month extension to the filing their accounts, through a fast-track online process.Over 10,000 businesses have already successfully applied for this extension.And we will continue to monitor companies’ ability to meet the range of other filing obligations they have under the Companies Act, and we will provide further extensions if needed.I recognise just how how hard employees, business owners and directors, are working to keep their companies going.It is crucial that when the crisis passes, as it will, we are ready to bounce back.And so today I want to announce more measures, which are designed to give businesses greater flexibility as they face the current crisis, to help them emerge intact the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic.We will introduce measures to improve the insolvency system, which provides the legal options for companies running into major difficulties.Our overriding objective is to help UK companies which need to undergo a financial rescue or restructuring process to keep trading. These measures will give those firms extra time and space to weather the storm and be ready when the crisis ends, whilst ensuring that creditors get the best return possible in circumstances.The changes to the insolvency regime will include new rules to make sure companies undergoing restructuring can continue to get hold of supplies and raw materials.And there will be a temporary suspension of wrongful trading provisions for company directors, to remove the threat of personal liability during the pandemic. This provision will have retrospective effect from 1 March. However, to be clear, all of the other checks and balances that help to ensure directors fulfil their duties properly, will remain in force.We will bring forward legislation in these areas at the earliest opportunity.We will also put in place measures to ensure that companies required to hold Annual General Meetings (AGM) can do so flexibly, in a manner that is compatible with the best public health guidance.This might include postponing, or holding the AGM online or by phone using only proxy voting.In addition, we are also introducing a range of measures to boost the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face masks, to protect frontline NHS staff.And we’re removing administrative barriers for the production of hand sanitiser. By reducing the amount of red tape, new suppliers and businesses that produce ingredients for safe hand sanitisers, will be able to bring their products to market in a matter of days.Companies including BrewDog and Ineos have already stepped forward to offer their services.I am incredibly proud of how businesses and individuals across our great nation, have risen to the challenge posed by COVID-19.Whether it’s offers from companies coming forward to support the ventilator challenge…or more than 700,000 people signing up to volunteer for our brilliant NHS…or those in the public and private sector working hard to keep our country safe and moving.Britain is meeting the challenge. Working together in a joint endeavour to get through this pandemic.And be in no doubt, the government will continue to fight tooth and nail to protect lives and livelihoods everywhere in this country as we stand shoulder to shoulder with our people and our businesses.Thank you."
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 27 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-duchy-of-lancaster-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-27-march-2020,Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 27 March 2020,2020-03-27,"Welcome everybody to the government’s daily briefing.I am joined today by the Chief Executive Officer of the NHS, Simon Stevens, and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Jenny Harries.I would like to update you all on the facts on the spread of COVID-19 and the steps we are taking in the battle against the coronavirus.113,777 people have now been tested for the virus. Of those, 14,543 have tested positive. An increase in the last day of 2,885.The best scientific analysis now is that the rate of infection has been doubling every 3-4 days.And of those who have contracted the virus, 759 have, sadly, died. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who have passed away.These figures are a powerful reminder of the need for all of us to act.We need to slow the spread of the virus and strengthen the NHS’s ability to protect us all.Strict social distancing measures have been put in place to restrict the spread of COVID-19 so fewer people should need hospital treatment at any one time.The measures we have put in place follow scientific and medical advice and are designed to reduce the rate of infection.And as well as acting to slow the spread of the virus, we are also acting to strengthen the NHS.We are expanding the number of beds available for new patients, we are increasing the number of staff in our hospitals and we are also investing in life-saving equipment for those with severe symptoms to give people the care they need when they need it most.I would like to thank all those involved in this effort to reinforce the frontline in the battle against the virus:The military personnel who are helping to fit out a new hospital in east London and who are helping to distribute personal protective equipment. The amazing doctors, nurses and support staff in our NHS. Those in manufacturing who have risen to the challenge of producing new ventilators and the hundreds of thousands who have volunteered to help in innumerable ways.This is a united national effort and the spirit of selflessness shown by so many is truly inspiring.And this virus, of course, affects us all.As you are no doubt already aware, the Prime Minister has coronavirus and is self-isolating at home in Downing Street.He began experiencing mild symptoms yesterday afternoon and was tested on the advice of England’s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty.The Prime Minister is continuing to lead the government’s response to coronavirus – chairing meetings and communicating with key members of his team through video conferencing.And earlier today the Prime Minister led the effort in launching our latest front in the fight against COVID-19.Today I can announce that the Prime Minister has brought together businesses, research institutes and universities in a new alliance to boost testing capacity for frontline workers.Increasing our testing capacity is absolutely crucial in our response to and our fight against coronavirus. This is a particular priority for those who work in the health and social care sector and are working so hard to keep us all safe.This will be antigen testing - testing whether people currently have the disease - so that our health and social care workers can have security in the knowledge that they are safe to return to work if their test is negative.These tests will be trialled for people on the front line starting immediately - with hundreds to take place by the end of the weekend, dramatically scaling up next week.And of course protecting our frontline workers is at the forefront of everyone’s minds at the moment.Last night, millions of people paid a fantastic tribute to the heroes and heroines of the NHS when they stepped outside their front doors and clapped our carers.And alongside those in health and social care, I also want to thank those who work in food production and retail, those who work for the Royal Mail and public transport, our teachers and our social workers. They all deserve our gratitude.Having talked to trade union and business leaders, civil servants and public spirited volunteers and of course ministers in the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in recent days, I want to record my admiration for the national solidarity being shown in the fight against this disease.All of us can support our NHS by continuing to follow the guidance to:To stay at home.To protect our NHS.And to save lives.I’ll now turn to the Chief Executive Officer of the NHS, Simon Stevens."
Chancellor's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/chancellor-outlines-new-coronavirus-support-measures-for-the-self-employed,Chancellor,2020-03-26,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 26 March 2020:Coronavirus press conference 26 March 2020.Good afternoon.Today I can announce the next step in the economic fight against the Coronavirus pandemic, with new support for the self-employed.Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of Coronavirus so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the NHS’s ability to cope.At every point, we have followed expert advice to be controlled in our actions – taking the right measures at the right times.We are taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by increasing the numbers of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment on the front-line to give people the care they need.That is why it is absolutely critical that people follow our instructions to stay at home, so we can protect our NHS and save lives.Our action plan to beat the pandemic is the right thing to do – but we know people are worrying about their jobs and their incomes.Working closely with businesses and trade unions, we have put together a coherent, coordinated and comprehensive economic plan – a plan which is already starting to make a difference:    big employers like Brewdog, Timpsons and Pret have already said that our Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme means they can furlough thousands of staff, rather than laying them off.  And we are publishing this evening detailed guidance on how the scheme will operate so that other businesses can take advantage, too        small businesses are already benefiting from Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans of up to £5 million, which are interest free for 12 months – with 30,000 enquiries in just four days        local authorities are already informing more than 700,000 retail, hospitality and leisure businesses that they will pay no business rates this year        and the new hardship grants scheme, providing cash grants of up to £25,000 for the smallest businesses, is now up and running  So if any business is struggling, and worrying they may need to lose staff, I would urge you to log on to businesssupport.gov.uk, and look very carefully at what support is available before deciding to lay people off.I’m proud of what we’ve done so far, but I know that many self-employed people are deeply anxious about the support available for them.Musicians and sound engineers; plumbers and electricians; taxi drivers and driving instructors; hairdressers and childminders and many others, through no fault of their own, risk losing their livelihoods.To you, I say this: You have not been forgotten. We will not let you behind. We are all in this together.So, to support those who work for themselves, today I am announcing a new Self-Employed Income Support Scheme.The government will pay self-employed people, who have been adversely affected by the Coronavirus, a taxable grant worth 80% of their average monthly profits over the last three years, up to £2,500 a month.This scheme will be open for at least three months – and I will extend it for longer if necessary.You’ll be able to claim these grants and continue to do business.And we’re covering the same amount of income for a self-employed person as we are for furloughed employees, who also receive a grant worth 80%.That’s unlike almost any other country and makes our scheme one of the most generous in the world.Providing such unprecedented support for self-employed people has been difficult to do in practice.And the self-employed are a diverse population, with some people earning significant profits.So I’ve taken steps to make this scheme deliverable, and fair:    to make sure that the scheme provides targeted support for those most in need, it will be open to anyone with income up to £50,000.        to make sure only the genuinely self-employed benefit, it will be available to people who make the majority of their income from self-employment        and to minimise fraud, only those who are already in self-employment, who have a tax return for 2019, will be able to apply  95% of people who are majority self-employed will benefit from this scheme.HMRC are working on this urgently and expect people to be able to access the scheme no later than the beginning of June.If you’re eligible, HMRC will contact you directly, ask you to fill out a simple online form, then pay the grant straight into your bank account.And to make sure no one who needs it misses out on support, we have decided to allow anyone who missed the filing deadline in January, four weeks from today to submit their tax return.But I know many self-employed people are struggling right now, so we’ve made sure that support is available.Self-employed people can access the business interruption loans.Self-assessment income tax payments, that were due in July, can be deferred to the end of January next year.And we’ve also changed the welfare system so that self-employed people can now access Universal Credit in full.A self-employed person with a non-working partner and two children, living in the social rented sector, can receive welfare support of up to £1,800 per month.The scheme I have announced today is fair.It is targeted at those who need it the most.Crucially, it is deliverable.And it provides an unprecedented level of support for self-employed people.As we’ve developed the scheme, I’m grateful for the conversations I’ve had with the Federation of Small Businesses, the association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed, and a range of trade unions, including the Trades Union Congress.But I must be honest and point out that in devising this scheme – in response to many calls for support – it is now much harder to justify the inconsistent contributions between people of different employment statuses.If we all want to benefit equally from state support, we must all pay in equally in future.These last ten days have shaken our country and economy as never before.In the last two weeks we have put aside ideology and orthodoxy to mobilise the full power and resources of the British state.We have done so in pursuit of a single goal: to protect people’s health and economic security, by supporting public services like our NHS, backing business, and protecting people’s jobs and incomes.What we have done will, I believe, stand as one of the most significant economic interventions at any point in the history of the British state, and by any government, anywhere in the world. We have:    pledged that whatever resources the NHS needs, it will get        promised to pay 80% of the wages of furloughed workers for three months up to £2,500        deferred more than £30 billion of tax payments until the end of the year        agreed nearly 17,000 Time to Pay arrangements for businesses and individuals        made available £330 billion of loans and guarantees        introduced cash grants of up to £25,000 for small business properties        covered the cost of statutory sick pay for small businesses for up to two weeks        lifted the incomes of over four million households with a nearly £7 billion boost to the welfare system        agreed three-month mortgage holidays with lenders and nearly £1 billion more support for renters through the Local Housing Allowance        and today we’ve announced one of the most generous self-employed support schemes in the world  Despite these extraordinary steps, there will be challenging times ahead. We will not be able to protect every single job or save every single business.But I am confident that the measures we have put in place will support millions of people, businesses and self-employed people to get through this, get through it together, and emerge on the other side both stronger and more united.Thank you."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 25 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-25-march-2020,Prime Minister,2020-03-25,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 25 March 2020:Coronavirus press conference 25 March 2020.Good afternoon.Thank you for joining us for today’s daily briefing on coronavirus.I would like to update you all on the government’s plan to defeat the virus and on the latest developments.I am joined once again by our Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and the Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance.From the very beginning of this crisis I have followed the advice of our world-leading scientists.To defeat coronavirus by taking the right measures at the right time.What everyone needs to recognise is that our NHS – like any world-class health service – has only limited numbers of doctors, nurses and specialist equipment.So, the more people who become sick at any one time, the harder it is for the NHS to cope.And so it is vital to delay the spread of the disease and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time.That is why we have given the clear instruction that people must stay at home – unless they have one of the reasons we have set out.And, with your help we will slow the spread of the disease.I want to thank everyone who has been following the clear rules that we set out on Monday.And I want to thank everyone in the NHS, the front line of the fight against coronavirus.And of course all our public services.Our teachers and our school staff, the transport workers, police officers,And everyone who is keeping this country going.But I also want to offer a special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS.When we launched the appeal last night we hoped to get 250,000 over a few days.But I can tell you that in just 24 hours 405,000 people have responded to the call.They will be driving medicines from pharmacies to patients.They will be bringing patients home from hospital.Very importantly they’ll be making regular phone calls to check on and support people who are staying on their own at home.And they will be absolutely crucial in the fight against this virus.That is already – in one day – as many volunteers as the population of Coventry.And so, to all of you, and to all the former NHS staff who are coming back now into the service.I say thank you on behalf of the entire country.Now I want to take some questions but finally I want to remind everyone of our core policy:Stay at homeProtect the NHSAnd save lives."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-23-march-2020,Prime Minister,2020-03-23,"Good Evening,The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone.All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer.And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help.And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have.Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses.And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger.To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from Coronavirus but from other illnesses as well.So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease.Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope - and save more lives.And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic.And though huge numbers are complying - and I thank you all - the time has now come for us all to do more.From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction -  you must stay at home.Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households.That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes:shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible  one form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household;  any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person; and  travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home.That’s all - these are the only reasons you should leave your home.You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No.You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can.If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately:close all shops selling non-essential goods,​ including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship;  we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with;  and we’ll stop all social events​, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals.Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed.No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this.I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs.And that’s why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business.And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to.But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost.And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through.Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with 7500 former clinicians now coming back to the service.With the time you buy - by simply staying at home - we are increasing our stocks of equipment.We are accelerating our search for treatments.We are pioneering work on a vaccine.And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer.I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus.Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline.But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted.Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together.To halt the spread of this disease.To protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives.And I know that as they have in the past so many times.The people of this country will rise to that challenge.And we will come through it stronger than ever.We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together.And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives.Thank you."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-22-march-2020,Prime Minister,2020-03-22,"Good afternoon everyoneThank you for coming, and thank you to Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, and Dr Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer.I want again to thank everyone in the country today for the huge effort that we are collectively making.I want to thank the amazing workers in the NHS, everybody working in social care, in every sector, in food distribution, transport, you name it – absolutely everyone who is keeping this country going today.And I want to thank everyone who is being forced to do something differently today.Everyone who didn’t visit their mum for Mother’s Day but Facetimed them, Skyped them, rang them instead.Thank you for your restraint and for what you did.Everyone who was forced to close a pub or a restaurant or a gym or any other business that could have done fantastic businesses on a great day like this.Thank you for your sacrifice, I know how tough it must be.And I can tell you again that this government will be standing behind you – behind British business, behind British workers, employees, self-employed – throughout this crisis.And the reason we are taking these unprecedented steps to prop up businesses, support businesses and support our economy and these preventative measures is because we have to slow the spread of the disease and to save thousands of lives.Today we have come to the stage of our plan that I advertised at the outset, when we first set out the plan of the UK government.When we have to take special steps to protect the particularly vulnerable.I said the moment would come where we needed to shield those with serious conditions. There are probably about 1.5 million in all.And in a minute Robert Jenrick will set out the plan in detail.But this shielding will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out to save life. That is what we want to do.Also to reduce infection and to slow the spread of the disease.We have to do more to make sure that the existing measures that we are taking are having the effect that we want.So it is crucial that people understand tomorrow that the schools are closed.And tomorrow you should not send your child to school unless you have been identified as a key worker.And more generally in the view of the way people have responded over the last few days to the measures we have set out I want to say a bit more about how we interact outdoors.Of course I want people to be able to go to the parks and open spaces and to enjoy themselves – it is crucial for health and mental and physical wellbeing.But please follow the advice and don’t think that fresh air in itself automatically provides some immunity.You have to stay two metres apart; you have to follow the social distancing advice.And even if you think you are personally invulnerable, there are plenty of people you can infect and whose lives will then be put at risk.And I say this now – on Sunday evening – take this advice seriously, follow it, because it is absolutely crucial.And as I have said throughout this process we will keep the implementation of these measures under constant review and, yes of course, we will bring forward further measures if we think that is necessary.Always remember that in following this advice- and I know how difficult that is – that each and every one of us.You are doing your bit in following this advice to slow the spread of this disease.The more we collectively slow the spread, the more time we give the NHS to prepare, the more lives we will save, the faster we will get through this.And always remember – we will get through this, and we will beat it together.Next Robert Jenrick to outline the shielding measures."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 20 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-20-march-2020,Prime Minister,2020-03-20,"Good afternoon and thank you for coming again,Today I am joined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Jennie Harries deputy chief medical officer.Yesterday I set out the ambition of this government to turn the tide against coronavirus within 3 months.And I want to repeat that determination today.We are going to do it with testing. We are going to do it with new medicines, and with new digital technology that will help us to see the disease as it is transmitted, and thereby, by eliminating it, to stamp it out.And above all, now we are going to defeat this disease with a huge national effort to slow the spread by reducing unnecessary social contact.And I want to thank everyone for following the guidance we issued on Monday:to stay at home for 7 days if you think you have the symptoms,for 14 days if anyone in your household has either of the symptoms – a new continuous cough or a high temperature.To avoid pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants.To work from home if at all possible.Keep washing your hands.I know it has been tough.I know it has been inconvenient.But these actions that we’re all taking together are already helping to take the strain off our NHS.Bit by bit, day by day, by your actions, your restraint and your sacrifice, we are putting this country in a better and stronger position, where we will be able to save literally thousands of lives, of people of all ages, people who don’t deserve to die now.People whose lives can, must, and will be saved.And as we take these actions together and as we make these sacrifices, we can see the impact on the real economy.Already, fantastic British companies, already under huge strain, big and small.Workers who are finding that their jobs are under threat or are going, through no fault of their own.And to all of them, we in government say: We will stand by you.And I say that to companies, remember our joint objective: to beat this virus. And we will do everything in our power to help.And in just a minute, Rishi is going to explain how we are going to help workers of all kinds to get through this crisis,Supporting you directly in a way that Government has never been done before, in addition to the package we have already set out for business.And of course these measures are intended to be temporary and of course I am confident that, in time, the UK economy is going to bounce back.Of course it is.But I must be absolutely clear with you: the speed of that eventual recovery depends entirely on our ability, our collective ability, to get on top of the virus now.And that means we have to take the next steps, on scientific advice and following our plan, we are strengthening the measures announced on Monday which you will remember.And of course people have already made a huge effort to comply with those measures for avoiding unnecessary social contact.But we need now to push down further on that curve of transmission between us.And so following agreement between all the formations of the United Kingdom, all the devolved administrations,We are collectively telling, telling cafes, pubs, bars, restaurants to close tonight as soon as they reasonably can, and not to open tomorrow.Though to be clear, they can continue to provide take-out services.We’re also telling nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close on the same timescale.Now, these are places where people come together, and indeed the whole purpose of these businesses is to bring people together. But the sad things is that today for now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart.And I want to stress that we will review the situation each month, to see if we can relax any of these measures.And listening to what I have just said, some people may of course be tempted to go out tonight. But please don’t.You may think you are invincible, but there is no guarantee you will get mild symptoms, and you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on to othersSo that’s why, as far as possible, we want you to stay at home, that’s how we can protect our NHS and save lives.To repeat, I know how difficult this is, how it seems to go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people. And I also know much, right now, workers and business deserve the financial reassurance we are giving them.But we will get through this.We will get through it together, and we will beat this virus.And to ram that point home: the more effectively we follow the advice that we are given, the faster this country will stage both a medical and an economic recovery in full."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 19 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-19-march-2020,Prime Minister,2020-03-19,"I want to begin by thanking everyone, by thanking you, in the media, and also thanking everyone for the huge efforts that the country is making to comply with the advice that we’ve been givenAnd we’re asking such a huge amount,asking students to put their education on hold,we’re asking people not to socialise in the normal wayAnd already we can see the impact that this is having on the UK economy and on business, on great, great companiesAnd so it’s vital that we in Government stand behind them when what we are asking everyone to do is so crucial for saving literally thousands of lives by defeating this virusAnd I am conscious as the days have gone by that people will want to know how long we are expecting them to keep it upAnd I wanted to try to say something today about how I see the timescale of this campaign and where we’re going and what we need to doI do think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeksAnd I am absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country but only if we take the steps, we all take the steps we have outlined,And that is vital because that is how we are going to reduce the peakand once we’ve achieved that, and I think that we will, if take the steps that I have said,then the scientific progress that we’re making will really start to come into play and I wanted to discuss a little bit of that this afternoon with youbecause we are rapidly becoming so much better at understanding the genomics at the heart of this virus, a lot of that is going on in this country,we’re getting better at understanding the medicines that may treat and cure itAnd today we have put the first British corona patient into a randomised trial for drugs that may treat the diseaseUK experts and scientists expect to start trials for the first vaccine within a monthAnd above all we are getting better at testingThis crisis is so difficult because the enemy is invisibleAnd the answer is to remove the cloak of invisibilityAnd to identify the virus, and to be able to know which of us, is carrying it or who has actually had it and now got over itAnd to give you an idea of what is coming down the trackWe are in negotiations today to buy a so called antibody testAs simple as a pregnancy testThat could tell whether you have had the diseaseAnd it’s early days, but if it works as its proponents claim then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable because obviously it has the potential to be a total gamechangerBecause once you know that you have had it, you know that you are likely to be less vulnerable, you’re less likely to pass it on, and you can go back to workAnd of course by the same token we are massively increasing the testing to see whether you have it nowAnd ramping up daily testing from 5000 a day to 10,000 to 25,000 and then up to 250,000And that knowledge of where the virus is, will make a huge difference to our management of the disease and our ability to reduce disruption and economic difficultiesAnd I wanted to set that out because this is rapidly coming down the track as I say, but it will take time to come on streamAnd that is why in the meantime, to get back to a theme that you know I’m going to repeat, it is absolutely vital that we follow the advice that we’ve been hearing over the last few days,The announcements we’ve already made about staying at home if you have the symptoms, if your family has the symptoms,about avoiding unnecessary contactAvoiding gatherings where you may pick up the diseasepubs, bars, restaurantsPlease, please follow all that advice scrupulouslyWork from home if you possibly canWash your hands, wash your handsAnd it’s by this combination of ruthless, determined, collective action and scientific progress that we’re already seeing that we will succeedAnd I know how difficult it may be, or it may seem right now, but if we do this together we will save, as I say, many many thousands of livesand to everybody in the UK, business world, everybody who is worried about their jobs, and everybody who faces difficulties because of the advice that we are giving,I say to business, stand by your employees, stand by your workers because we will stand by youAnd you’ll be hearing more about that in the course of the next day or soAnd that is how, by a mixture of determined, collective action and scientific progress, I have absolutely no doubt that we will turn the tide of this disease and beat it together."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 18 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-18-march-2020,Prime Minister,2020-03-18,"Good afternoon. And thanks for coming or for indeed tuning in to these daily updates. I want to introduce, I’m sure you know Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, and you know Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Advisor.I want to tell you where we got to in our national fightback against the coronavirus. Today the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies met to discuss the latest evidence on the spread of the virus and the effects of the measures we have already taken to slow its spread. And Patrick is going to update us in a second about that.I want to repeat that everyone – everyone – must follow the advice to protect themselves and their families, but also – more importantly – to protect the wider public. So stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms. Remember the two key symptoms are high temperature, a continuous new cough.Whole household to stay at home for 14 days if one member in that household thinks he/she has the symptoms. Avoid all unnecessary gatherings – pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, theatres and so on and work from home if you can. Wash your hands.And we have already announced in the last few days we will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so we hit 25,000 tests a day.A huge public information campaign is being rolled out so people get all the information they need to protect themselves and others.We are asking retired healthcare professionals to come back and help us cope, help the NHS to cope, with this unprecedented challenge.And we will continue as we have from the beginning to do the right thing at the right time and to follow the best scientific advice.And we come today to the key issue of schools where we have been consistently advised that there is an important trade off.  And so far the judgment of our advisers has been that closing schools is actually of limited value in slowing the spread of the epidemic.And that is partly because counterintuitively schools are actually very safe environments. And in this disease and epidemic children and young people are much less vulnerable.And hitherto the advice has been that we should keep schools open if possible in order to reduce the pressure on the NHS and on all other public services. But I think you’ll agree I have always been very clear that this is a balanced judgment and one that we have kept under constant review.So looking at the curve of the disease and looking at where we are now – we think now that we must apply downward pressure, further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing the schools.So I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils – for the vast majority of pupils- until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils.The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that.But of course, as I’ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work.And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too – from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups.So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children.This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning.So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. We are making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear we will reimburse the cost. And of course this does mean that exams will not take place as planned in May and June. Though we will make sure that pupils get the qualifications they need and deserve for their academic career.Now I know that these steps will not be easy for parents or teachers. And for many parents, this will be frustrating, and it will make it harder for them to go out to work.And of course that is one of the reasons we haven’t wanted to go ahead and that’s why we are working now on further measures to ensure that we support not just businesses but also individuals and their families to keep our economy going as Rishi Sunak the Chancellor outlined yesterday.I also need to remind parents that, as we have already advised, children should not be left with older grandparents, or older relatives, who may be particularly vulnerable or fall into some of the vulnerable groups and I know that will be difficult too. And I want to thank families for their sacrifice at this difficult time. I want to thank whole country for the efforts people are making to comply with these measures.I particularly want to thank the teachers, head teachers and all the support staff who keep schools going who will make these exceptional arrangements work, for the benefit of us all.By looking after the children of key workers they will be a critical part of our fightback against Coronavirus. As I have said, we will take the right steps at the right time, guided by the science.We believe the steps we have already taken, together with those I am announcing today, are already slowing the spread of the disease.But we will not hesitate to go further, and faster, in the days and weeks ahead.And we will do whatever it takes to so that we beat it together."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 17 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-17-march-2020,Prime Minister,2020-03-17,"I want to go through our overall plan for beating this new coronavirus.First, we must stop the disease spreading to a point where it overwhelms our NHS. Every country in the world has the same problem.This is a disease that is so dangerous and so infectious that without drastic measures to check its progress it would overwhelm any health system in the world.I have used the Italian health system, it is excellent, and the problem is not the health system, it’s the numbers of sufferance.That is why we announced the steps yesterday that we did – advising against all unnecessary contact – steps that are unprecedented since World War 2.They will have an effect on the spread of the disease.The shielding of vulnerable groups will also reduce suffering, and I want to thank everybody at this stage for what we’re all doing to follow this advice.I stress that although the measures announced are already extreme, we may well have to go further and faster in the coming days to protect lives and the NHS.Secondly, we are doing all we can and as quickly as we can to increase the capacity of the NHS. That means more testing, more beds, more ventilators and more trained staff. It means greater support for NHS and other staff. And it means much better data and much better technology.Third, we must do all we can to boost science and research. We must study this disease, test drugs that already exist and have been through medical trials to see what helps treat severe cases, and search for a vaccine.Fourth, we must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy. That’s the main purpose of this press conference this afternoon.We must support millions of businesses and tens of millions of families and individuals through the coming months.  And to do that the government machine must and will respond with a profound sense of urgency. Thousands of brilliant officials are already working round the clock but we must do more and faster. The Chancellor will be saying much more about this in a moment, with further announcements in the coming days.Fifth, we will need to strengthen other public services that will be under great pressure from the direct and indirect effects of the disease, such as the effects of staff shortages, and from the economic pressures. All institutions will be under great pressure and we will therefore invest hugely in the people that we all rely on, and again I want to thank all our public servants for what they are already doing.Ultimately, to beat this crisis we will need a combination of better science, technology, medicine, data, government operations, economic support, learning from other countries and social support. As time goes on we will learn more and more about the disease and the effects of our actions. And while we need national unity, we also need international cooperation. And although we now need to impose physical distance between ourselves, we must at the same time have closer social support for each other.Yes this enemy can be deadly, but it is also beatable – and we know how to beat it and we know that if as a country we follow the scientific advice that is now being given we know that we will beat it.And however tough the months ahead we have the resolve and the resources to win the fight.And, to repeat, this government will do whatever it takes.I will now handover for more on that to Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-16-march-2020,Prime Minister,2020-03-16,"Good afternoon everybody, thank you very much for coming. I wanted to bring everyone up to date with the national fight back against the new coronavirus and the decisions that we’ve just taken in COBR for the whole of the UK.As we said last week, our objective is to delay and flatten the peak of the epidemic by bringing forward the right measures at the right time, so that we minimise suffering and save lives. And everything we do is based scrupulously on the best scientific advice.Last week we asked everyone to stay at home if you had one of two key symptoms: a high temperature or a new and continuous cough.Today, we need to go further, because according to SAGE [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] it looks as though we’re now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve.And without drastic action, cases could double every 5 or 6 days.So, first, we need to ask you to ensure that if you or anyone in your household has one of those two symptoms, then you should stay at home for fourteen days.That means that if possible you should not go out even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. If necessary, you should ask for help from others for your daily necessities. And if that is not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies.And even if you don’t have symptoms and if no one in your household has symptoms, there is more that we need you to do now.So, second, now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues.It goes without saying, we should all only use the NHS when we really need to. And please go online rather than ringing NHS 111.Now, this advice about avoiding all unnecessary social contact, is particularly important for people over 70, for pregnant women and for those with some health conditions.And if you ask, why are we doing this now, why now, why not earlier, or later? Why bring in this very draconian measure?The answer is that we are asking people to do something that is difficult and disruptive of their lives.And the right moment, as we’ve always said, is to do it when it is most effective, when we think it can make the biggest difference to slowing the spread of the disease, reducing the number of victims, reducing the number of fatalities.And as we take these steps we should be focusing on the most vulnerable.So third, in a few days’ time – by this coming weekend – it will be necessary to go further and to ensure that those with the most serious health conditions are largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks.And again the reason for doing this in the next few days, rather than earlier or later, is that this is going to be very disruptive for people who have such conditions, and difficult for them, but, I believe, it’s now necessary.And we want to ensure that this period of shielding, this period of maximum protection coincides with the peak of the disease.And it’s now clear that the peak of the epidemic is coming faster in some parts of the country than in others.And it looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead.So, to relieve the pressure on the London health system and to slow the spread in London, it’s important that Londoners now pay special attention to what we are saying about avoiding non-essential contact, and to take particularly seriously the advice about working from home, and avoiding confined spaces such as pubs and restaurants.Lastly, it remains true as we have said in the last few weeks that risks of transmission of the disease at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low.But obviously, logically as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it is right that we should extend this advice to mass gatherings as well.And so we’ve also got to ensure that we have the critical workers we need, that might otherwise be deployed at those gatherings, to deal with this emergency.So from tomorrow, we will no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do. So mass gatherings, we are now moving emphatically away from.And I know that many people – including millions of fit and active people over 70 – may feel, listening to what I have just said, that there is something excessive about these measures.But I have to say, I believe that they are overwhelmingly worth it to slow the spread of the disease, to reduce the peak, to save life, minimise suffering and to give our NHS the chance to cope.Over the last few days, I have been comparing notes and talking to leaders around the world and I can tell you that the UK is now leading a growing global campaign amongst all our friends and allies, whether in the G7, the G20, the UN, the IMF – all those bodies in which we play a significant role.We’re leading a campaign to fight back against this disease.To keep the economy growing, to make sure that humanity has access to the drugs and the treatments that we all need, and the UK is also at the front of the effort to back business, to back our economy, to make sure that we get through it.I know that today we are asking a lot of everybody. It is far more now than just washing your hands - though clearly washing your hands remains important.But I can tell you that across this country, people and businesses in my experience are responding with amazing energy and creativity to the challenge that we face, and I want to thank everybody for the part that you are playing and are going to play."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 12 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-12-march-2020,Prime Minister,2020-03-12,"Good afternoon everybody and thank you very much for coming.I’ve just chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee including ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.And it’s clear that coronavirus, COVID-19, continues and will continue to spread across the world and our country over the next few months. We’ve done what can be done to contain this disease and this has bought us valuable time.But it is now a global pandemic.And the number of cases will rise sharply and indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests.I’ve got to be clear, we’ve all got to be clear, that this is the worst public health crisis for a generation.Some people compare it to seasonal flu. Alas, that is not right. Owing to the lack of immunity, this disease is more dangerous.And it’s going to spread further and I must level with you, level with the British public, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. And the Chief Scientific Adviser will set out the best information we have on that in a moment.But as we’ve said over the last few weeks, we have a clear plan that we are now working through.And we are now moving to the next phase in that plan.Because this is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we’ll have more time for medical research.We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope.The Chief Medical Officer will set out our lines of defence. We have to deploy these at the right time to maximise their effect. The most important task will be to protect our elderly and most vulnerable people during the peak weeks when there is the maximum risk of exposure to the disease and when the NHS will be under the most pressure. So the most dangerous period is not now but some weeks away depending on how fast it spreads.Today therefore we are moving forward with our plan. From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild – either a new continuous cough or a high temperature – then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease.We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips.At some point in the next few weeks, we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms, we will be asking everyone in the household to stay at home. We are not introducing this yet for reasons Sir Patrick will explain, but I want to signal now that this is coming down the track.We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. The scientific advice as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread.But there is also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. So we’re discussing these issues with colleagues in all parts of the United Kingdom and will have more to say shortly about the timing of further action in that respect.At all stages, we have been guided by the science, and we will do the right thing at the right time.We are not - repeat not - closing schools now. The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good at this time. But we are of course keeping this under review and this again may change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so. And that remains our advice.There is no escaping the reality that these measures will cause severe disruption across our country for many months.The best scientific advice is that this will help us slow the disease and save lives. There will be detailed information available on the NHS website and from 111 online. But I want to stress something that is very important in the wake of what we’re saying this afternoon – I urge people, who think in view of what we’re saying about their potential symptoms that they should stay at home, not to call 111 but to use the internet for information if they can.I also want at this stage to speak directly to older people. Because this disease is particularly dangerous for you, for older people, even though the vast majority this will be a mild to moderate illness, I know that many people will be very worried. And I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives, the more vulnerable members of their family, our neighbours, and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months. We’re going to need to mobilise millions of people to help and support each other. And I just want to you to know that the government will do all we can to help you and your family during this period. We’re not just going to be as you saw yesterday supporting the economy during this period, we will be providing money and many other forms of support, and helping communities to support each other.And as we have done over the last few weeks, we will continue to provide, as soon as we have it, as much clear scientific and medical information as we can.So I’d like to end by repeating the two important messages, with which you will have become familiar – it is still vital, perhaps more vital than ever – that we remember to wash our hands.And lastly of course even if things seem tough now, just to remember, that we will get through this, this country will get through this epidemic, just as it has got through many tougher experiences before if we look out for each other and commit wholeheartedly to a full national effort."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-9-march-2020,Prime Minister,2020-03-09,"This morning I chaired a meeting of the government’s COBR emergency committee on the Coronavirus outbreak.The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales and the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland also attended and we agreed to continue to work closely in the weeks and months ahead.We received a detailed briefing from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Advisor. And again I repeat my gratitude to both Chris and to Patrick.There have now been four deaths from coronavirus in the UK, and our deepest sympathies are obviously with their friends and families.Our action plan as you know sets out the four phases of our approach to tackling the virus: Contain, Delay, Research, and Mitigate.We remain in the Contain phase of the outbreak, but watching what is happening around the world, our scientists think containment is extremely unlikely to work on its own, and that is why we are making extensive preparations for a move to the delay phase.We are preparing various actions to slow the spread of this disease in order to reduce the strain it places on the NHS. The more we can delay the peak of the spread to the summer, the better the NHS will be able to manage.Patrick and Chris will give you some more detailed information on the latest advice we are giving the public today - and how we expect that advice to change as the outbreak develops.As things stand I’m afraid it bears repeating that the best thing we can all do is wash our hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. We will also take questions, because I know there are lots of things the public want to hear from our advisors about.But before that I want to stress the following things:First, we are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice.Second, we have a truly brilliant NHS, where staff have responded with all the determination, compassion and skill that makes their service so revered across the world. And they will continue to have this government’s full support, my support, in tackling this virus on the frontline.Third, we will set out further steps in the days and weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particular the elderly and vulnerable.And finally, while it is absolutely critical, it’s absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time, based on the latest and best evidence. So we must not do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out to be counterproductive.There is no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK, just as it does in other countries.But if we continue to look out for one another, to pull together in a united and national effort, I have no doubt that we can and will rise to that challenge. And I’m now going to ask Patrick and then Chris to give their own perspective on where we are."
Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 March 2020,https://www.gov.uk//government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-3-march-2020,Prime Minister,2020-03-03,"Good morning and thank you for coming along, and I am very glad to be joined this morning by the government’s Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Advisor.Today we have published the Coronavirus Action Plan setting out how all four parts of the UK will take all necessary and reasonable steps to tackle this outbreak.The plan has four strands. Containing the virus, delaying its spread, researching its origins and cure, and finally mitigating the impact should the virus become more widespread. That is, contain, delay, research, mitigate.And let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus, this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we’ve already seen.But I fully understand public concern, your concern, about the global spread of this virus. And it is highly likely that we will see a growing number of UK cases.And that’s why keeping the country safe is the government’s overriding priority. And our plan means we’re committed to doing everything possible based on the advice of our world leading scientific experts to prepare for all eventualities.Let’s not forget – we already have a fantastic NHS, fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease.We will make sure the NHS gets all the support it needs to continue their brilliant response to the virus so far.The plan does not set out what the government will do, it sets out the steps we could take at the right time along the basis of the scientific advice.Our country remains extremely well prepared, as it has been since the outbreak began in Wuhan several months ago.Finally, crucially, we must not forget what we can all do to fight this virus, which is to wash our hands, you knew I was going to say this, but wash our hands with soap and water. And forgive me for repeating this but there will be people who will be tuning into this for the first time: wash your hands with soap and hot water for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.It’s simple advice but it’s the single most important thing we can do, as I think our experts would attest.But at this stage, and with the exception of all of the points I have just mentioned, I want to stress that for the vast majority of the people of this country, we should be going about our business as usual."
