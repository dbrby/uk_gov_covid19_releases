"1","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 19 December 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a statement at the coronavirus press conference.","Good afternoon,

I am sorry to report that the situation has deteriorated since I last spoke to you three days ago.

Yesterday afternoon, I was briefed on the latest data showing the virus spreading more rapidly in London, the South East and the East of England than would be expected given the tough restrictions which are already in place.

I also received an explanation for why the virus is spreading more rapidly in these areas. It appears this spread is now being driven by the new variant of the virus, which we first learned about earlier this week.

Our advisory group on New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats – NERVTAG – has spent the last few days analysing the new variant.

There is no evidence the variant causes more severe illness or higher mortality, but it does appear to be passed on significantly more easily.

NERVTAG’s early analysis suggests the new variant could increase R by 0.4 or greater. Although there is considerable uncertainty, it may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old variant.

This is early data. It is subject to review. It is the best we have at the moment, and we have to act on information as we have it because this is now spreading very fast.

The U.K. has by far the best genomic sequencing ability in the world, which means we are better able to identify new strains like this than any other country.

The Chief Medical Officer last night submitted our findings so far to the World Health Organisation and we will continue to be totally transparent with our global partners.

There is still much we don’t know. While we are fairly certain the variant is transmitted more quickly, there is no evidence to suggest that it is more lethal or causes more severe illness. Equally there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine will be any less effective against the new variant.

Our experts will continue their work to improve our understanding of the variant.

So we are learning more about this variant as we go.

But we know enough already to be sure that we must act now.

I met ministers on the Covid Operations Committee last night and again first thing this morning, and Cabinet met at lunchtime to agree the following actions.

First, we will introduce new restrictions in the most affected areas – specifically those parts of London, the South East and the East of England which are currently in tier 3.

These areas will enter a new tier 4, which will be broadly equivalent to the national restrictions which were in place in England in November.

That means:

Residents in those areas must stay at home, apart from limited exemptions set out in law.
Non-essential retail, indoor gyms and leisure facilities, and personal care services must close.
People must work from home if they can, but may travel to work if this is not possible, for example in the construction and manufacturing sectors.
People should not enter or leave tier 4 areas, and tier 4 residents must not stay overnight away from home.
Individuals can only meet one person from another household in an outdoor public space.

Unlike the November national restrictions, communal worship can continue to take place in tier 4 areas.

These measures will take effect from tomorrow morning.

All tiers will continue to be regularly reviewed in line with the approach previously set out, with the next formal review point taking place on 30 December.

Second, we are issuing new advice on travel.

Although the new variant is concentrated in tier 4 areas, it is nonetheless present at lower levels around the country.

We are asking everyone, in all tiers, to stay local.

People should carefully consider whether they need to travel abroad and follow the rules in their tier.

Those in tier 4 areas will not be permitted to travel abroad apart from limited exceptions, such as for work purposes.

Third, we must, I am afraid, look again at Christmas.

As Prime Minister, it is my duty to take the difficult decisions, to do what is right to protect the people of this country.

Given the early evidence we have on this new variant of the virus, and the potential risk it poses, it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned.

In England, those living in tier 4 areas should not mix with anyone outside their own household at Christmas, though support bubbles will remain in place for those at particular risk of loneliness or isolation.

Across the rest of the country, the Christmas rules allowing up to three households to meet will now be limited to Christmas Day only, rather than the five days as previously set out.

As before, there will be no relaxation on 31 December, so people must not break the rules at New Year.

I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is for grandparents to see their grandchildren, and for families to be together.

So I know how disappointing this will be, but we have said throughout this pandemic that we must and we will be guided by the science.

When the science changes, we must change our response.

When the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defence.

As your Prime Minister, I sincerely believe there is no alternative open to me. Without action, the evidence suggests infections would soar, hospitals would become overwhelmed and many thousands more would lose their lives.

I want to stress we are not alone in this fight – many of our European friends and neighbours are being forced to take similar action.

We are working closely with the devolved administrations to protect people in every part of the UK.

Of course there is now hope – real hope – that we will soon be rid of this virus.

That prospect is growing with every day that passes and every vaccine dose administered.

The UK was the first country in the western world to start using a clinically approve vaccine.

So please, if the NHS contacts you then get your vaccine – and join the 350,000 people across the UK who have already had their first dose.

Yes, Christmas this year will be very different, but we must be realistic.

We are sacrificing our chance to see loved ones this Christmas, so we have a better chance of protecting their lives so we can see them at future Christmases.

As sure as night follows day, we will beat back this virus.

We will defeat it.

And we will reclaim our lives.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-12-19,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-19-december-2020"

It is just a week since the United Kingdom began the biggest vaccination programme in our history.

And the public is coming forward at an extraordinary pace to get a jab, to protect themselves,

beginning with the elderly and the most vulnerable.

With 138,000 recipients of the first dose – and more joining them every minute - there is no doubt we are winning and we will win our long struggle against this virus

which makes it all the more important that we hold our nerve this winter.

Because we are now in a race to protect us all while doing everything we can to keep the virus under control.

And thanks to the colossal collective effort in November

we did bring the R below 1

we did get the infection rate down.

But I must be frank with you

we are already seeing worrying rises in some parts of the country:

Kent is still seeing rising infections

the number of cases in London is at 270 per 100,000 people.

And that’s why we acted quickly by moving London into Tier 3 from today.

And tomorrow the Health Secretary will announce the outcome of the latest tiering review.

And so like every other European country facing similar challenges

we have come to this moment, a great global festival

a turning point, a time of year that is of immense emotional and spiritual importance.

But also a moment for us to exercise extreme caution

when we must remember that one of the most striking features of this virus is that it spreads invisibly from people who don’t even have symptoms

which is in fact around 1 in 3 of everyone infected.

And that’s why from the beginning this virus has been so hard to fight and that’s why it’s so important to follow the rules

and why this Christmas it’s vital that everyone exercises the greatest possible personal responsibility.

And having looked at the latest data – with our colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,

we have decided that the overall situation is alas worse and more challenging than we had hoped when we first set the rules.

So while it would not be right to criminalise people who have made plans and simply want to spend time with their loved ones,

we are all collectively across the UK, governments at every level,

asking you to think hard and in detail about the days ahead

and whether you can do more to protect yourself and others.

We are keeping the laws the same – but we all want to send the same message:

a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas, and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas.

When we say three households can meet on five days,

I want to stress these are maximums, not targets to aim for.

And of course it is always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet.

And that means that if you are visiting others over Christmas,

we are asking you – in the five days beforehand, as early as this Friday -

to reduce the number of people you are in contact with to the lowest possible

because this virus spreads from human contact.

If possible don’t travel from a high prevalence to a low prevalence area

and avoid staying away from home overnight if you can.

Remember, the vaccine is on the way and our aim is to inoculate everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable or elderly in the early months of next year.

So if you’re elderly, the best way to minimise your personal risk is to wait to be vaccinated before spending time indoors with others.

And if you have an elderly relative, you might want to delay seeing them until they’ve been vaccinated.

And whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day Sales

And no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the New Year – remember the rules in your local area will apply.

In most places across the UK, I’m afraid that means you cannot mix with other households indoors.

All the information about how best to protect yourself and your loved ones is being made available on gov.uk.

So have yourselves a merry little Christmas

And I’m afraid this year I do mean little

But with the vaccine, and all the other measures that we are taking,

We do know things will be better in this country by Easter

And I’m sure that next year Christmas will be as normal for every family in the country.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-12-16,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-december-2020"
"3","Speech","Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 10 December 2020","Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock gave a statement at the coronavirus press conference.","Coronavirus press conference (10 December 2020)

Good evening, and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.

Today I’m joined by Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and Professor Steve Powis, Medical Director of NHS England.

The start of our COVID-19 vaccination programme on Tuesday was the latest in a long line of firsts for the NHS. The NHS was the first health care system in the world to roll out the vaccines for other deadly diseases like TB, measles, mumps and rubella, and meningitis C.

So I’m so proud we can now add COVID-19 to that list.

Before updating you on vaccine deployment, I’d like to go through the latest coronavirus data.

The average number of new cases each day is now 16,236 – that has risen over the last week.

Today, there are 15,242 COVID patients in hospital across the UK – which is slightly less than last week. And sadly, 516 deaths were reported yesterday.

Vaccine deployment

The fall in the number of cases has flattened off – and is rising in some parts of the country like Kent, Essex and some parts of London.

It shows us this fight is far from over and how we must all play our part and stay on our guard, now and through Christmas.

We’ve got help on the horizon and we can all see that with the vaccine – so don’t blow it now. And of course, this shows why the deployment of a vaccine is so important.

I just want to take a moment to thank everyone involved in the vaccine rollout so far, which has been done with such professionalism and skill.

And today I want to pay a special tribute and thank pharmacists, who are working with such a tricky vaccine. Must be kept cold at -70 degrees. They have done so much work to get ready for this moment at such pace.

As of today, we are vaccinating in 73 hospitals across the UK. Tens of thousands of people have had the jab.

I want to set out the next steps.

I can confirm that we will shortly expand our vaccination programme further to 10 more locations in England and from next week we will begin vaccinations in GP-led sites and vaccinate in care homes by Christmas.

We will keep on expanding this roll out to reach more and more people.

As more vaccines come on stream, we will open vaccination centres in larger venues, like sports stadia and conference halls next year and that’s when most people can expect to get their jabs.

When the time comes, the NHS will get in touch with you – so you don’t need to come forward and get in contact with the NHS.

Get the jab

On Tuesday in Milton Keynes, it was great to meet some of the patients and the staff involved.

And I loved what Barbara – who’s 82 – said. When she got her jab there she said: “I’d much rather get the vaccine than COVID-19 itself”.

I’m with Barbara. It’s free according to need – and it’s the very best way to protect you and to protect those around you. And when enough people get vaccinated – and we see those hospitalisations coming down – we can then start lifting those restrictions which have made this year so tough.

And I felt so proud when I sat with Muhammad Hassan, I sat with him while he got his jab. He’s a doctor at Milton Keynes Hospital who volunteered to treat COVID patients – and himself caught COVID in the first peak.

He said the jab was painless.

But we also talked about the challenges that we still face right now while we roll out the jab across the country.

Protect the NHS

Even with this mass vaccination programme, for the next few months, we will not have sufficient protection through the vaccination programme.

This is always the most difficult time for the NHS anyway for the winter months.

And with the number of cases flattening again, we’ve all got to do our bit and not put more pressure on the NHS.

To do that, we must keep respecting the rules where we are and take those sensible steps that we can all take: washing our hands, covering our face and making space between people, respecting that social distancing and the rules that come with it.

We can’t stop that now, just because the vaccine is here.

And even if you’ve had the jab, you are not immune. The vaccine will not fully protect you until 7 days after you’ve received the second dose and we don’t yet know if it will stop you from passing on the disease to other people.

So we all have to keep acting as if we still can pass it on. That is the safest way to get the number of cases down and keep people safe.

London, Kent and Essex

I’m particularly concerned about the number of cases in London, Kent and Essex.

Cases are rising – and in many areas, already high.

Looking into the detail, the testing results and surveys show us that by far the fastest rise is among secondary school age children, 11 to 18 year-olds while the rate among adults in London is broadly flat.

But we know from experience that a sharp rise in cases in younger people can lead to a rise amongst more vulnerable age groups later. We’ve seen that happen before.

So we need to do everything we can to stop the spread among school-age children in London right now.

We must not wait until the review which will take place on the 16 December.

We need to take targeted action immediately.

Having spoken to the leaders of London’s councils, and to the mayor, we have decided to put in place an immediate plan for testing all secondary school aged children in the 7 worst affected boroughs of London, in parts of Essex that border London, and parts of Kent.

We want to keep schools open, because that’s both right for education and right for public health.

We are therefore surging mobile testing units and we will be working with schools and local authorities to encourage these children and their families to get tested over the coming days.

More details will be set out tomorrow.

And I want to urge all those involved to step forward for testing.

It is important that 11 to 18 year-olds get tested in these boroughs irrespective of whether they have symptoms – this is a really important point, because we know that you can have COVID – and you can still pass it on – even without symptoms.

Around 1 in 3 people with COVID have no symptoms at all but they can still pass it on to others.

I know that nobody wants to be responsible for endangering those around them so I urge everyone involved to get a test.

We surged testing in Leicester. We surged testing in Liverpool.

We know that community testing can work and it requires a collective spirit of determination and resilience, and of people coming together to do the right thing. Something I have confidence that everybody involved will find in the days to come.

This sort of community testing deployment is not just available in London, Kent and Essex, where cases are rising, but also across the country to help get cases coming down.

We are now working with over 100 local authorities across England – and with the 3 devolved administrations – to help get cases down using community testing.

This includes Manchester, Kirklees and Lancashire, who are planning to mobilise community-based testing in their areas before Christmas. As are Manchester and Kirklees.

This offer remains available across the UK to be done in partnership with local authorities and devolved administrations.

Test and Trace 2.0

We can deploy this sort of massive testing, because of the work NHS Test and Trace have done so effectively to build our vast testing capacity.

Our new NHS Test and Trace Business Plan, which we published today, sets out how we will grow this yet further.

Today’s figures on testing and tracing show that – thanks to improvements in the way we do contact tracing – by reducing the number of repeat calls that are made to individual households, which has been one of the pieces of feedback that we’ve received, our contact tracing now reaches 86% of contacts, and that’s up from around 60% just a few weeks ago.

I want to pay tribute to the contact tracing team, working under Dido Harding, for delivering on this very significant improvement.

From today, I can confirm that people instructed to isolate by the COVID-19 app, and are eligible, can claim the £500 Test and Trace Support Payment directly through the app too.

Hospital upgrades

Even as we work to overcome these immediate challenges, I’m determined that we also lose no time in modernising our hospitals.

Today, I can announce 1,800 projects, which are being funded from our £600 million package to upgrade and refurbish hospitals across 178 NHS trusts this year.

This will include projects for fixing roofs, for new MRI machines. These projects, which will be completed over the winter period, will make a real difference for staff and patients alike and help our NHS build back better.

Close

These announcements that I’m making today show just what a massive effort is needed every day to tackle coronavirus even with the vaccine on the horizon.

I’m very grateful to all those working in schools, local authorities, delivering the vaccine rollout, our pharmacists, NHS Test and Trace and the hospital improvement programme for the efforts that will be needed to deliver all of this.

It shows that every part of our NHS – from GP surgeries to hospitals – and every part of government – local and national – is all playing its part in the battle against this virus.

We’ve got to remember, in this battle, that we’re all on the same side.

And, especially with Christmas coming, there’s something we all can do which is to respect the rules, and all of us, at all times, do all that we can to stop the spread of the virus.

This is a marathon, not a sprint.

We’ve got to keep going.

The finish line is in sight.

And I know that, together, we can get there.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-12-10,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-10-december-2020"
"4","Speech","Prime Minister's statement to the House of Commons on coronavirus regulations: 1 December 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement to the House of Commons.","Mr Speaker, I beg to move that these Regulations now be approved.

And I want to begin by telling the House that I was hugely encouraged by a visit I paid only yesterday to a vaccine plant in North Wales

where I saw for myself the vials of one of seven vaccines backed by the UK Government

that could turn the tide of our struggle against Covid,

not just in this country but around the world.

It is the protection of those vaccines that could get our economies moving again,

and allow us to reclaim our lives.

And that one plant in Wrexham

could produce 300 million doses a year

and yesterday was the momentous day when it began to manufacture the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.

And it was a very moving moment Mr Speaker when I talked to one of the brilliant young scientists there,

And she described the extraordinary moment for her in her life,

to be part of an enterprise that was she thought truly going to offer humanity a route out of this suffering.

But Mr Speaker, we have to be realistic,

And we have to accept that this vaccine is not here yet, no vaccine is here yet

and while all the signs are promising

and almost every scientist I’ve talked to agrees that the breakthrough will surely come

we do not yet have one that has gained regulatory approval.

We can’t be completely sure when the moment will arrive

and until then we cannot afford to relax,

especially during the cold months of winter.

The national measures which are now shortly ending in England

have eased the burden on the NHS and begun to reverse the advance of the virus.

Today, the R is back below 1

and the ONS survey is showing that signs of the infection rate are levelling off

and Imperial College London has found that the number of people with Covid has fallen by a third in England since 2nd November.

But while the virus has been contained, it has not been eradicated.

The latest ONS figures suggest that out of every 85 people in England, one has Coronavirus; far more than in the Summer

between 24th November and yesterday, 3,222 people across the UK lost their lives;

and despite the immense progress of the last four weeks,

our NHS remains under pressure, with hospitals in three regions – the South West, the North East and Yorkshire - all treating more Covid patients now than at the peak of the first wave.

So we can’t simply allow the current restrictions to expire for the reason he gives with no replacement whatever.

With the spread of the epidemic varying across the country, there remains a compelling case for regional tiers in England and indeed Mr Speaker a compelling necessity for regional tiers.

But I hope the House is clear what I am not asking for today.

This is not another lockdown,

nor is this the renewal of the existing measures in England.

The tiers that I am proposing would mean that from tomorrow

everyone in England

– including those in tier 3 –

will be free to leave their homes for any reason.

And when they do, they will find the shops open for Christmas,

the hairdressers open,

the nail bars open,

gyms and leisure centres, swimming pools open,

churches, synagogues, mosques and temples will be open for communal worship.

Organised outdoor sport will resume,

and in every tier you will be able to meet others in parks and in public gardens subject to the Rule of Six.

And every one of those things has been by necessity restricted until today.

Every one of them would be allowed again tomorrow.

Of course I accept that this is not a return to normality. I wish it were so.

But it is a bit closer to normality than the present restrictions.

And what we cannot do is lift all of the restrictions at once, or move too quickly, in such a way that the virus would begin to spread rapidly again.

That would be the surest way of endangering our NHS and forcing us into a new year lockdown, with all the costs that that would impose.

We all accept that the burden on the hospitality sector has been very great.

We feel this deeply, because our pubs, our hotels, restaurants they are in many ways the heart of the communities

And part of the fabric of our identity as a country

And everybody can see that the hospitality industry has borne a disproportionate share of the burden in this crisis. There’s no question about it. And that is obviously because we want to keep schools open Mr Speaker and we have to take such measures as we can.

I would just remind the House however, that we are not alone in this.

In France bars, restaurants and gyms will not reopen until 20th January at the earliest.

In Germany, the hospitality sector will remain closed in its entirety over Christmas.

But we will do everything in our power to support our hospitality sector throughout this crisis.

We have already extended the furlough scheme for all businesses until the end of March,

We’ve provided monthly grants of up to £3,000 for premises forced to close,

and £2,100 for those that remain open but have suffered because of reduced demand.

We have allocated £1.1 billion for local authorities to support businesses at particular risk.

And today Mr Speaker we are going further with a one-off payment of £1,000 in December to wet pubs – that is Mr Speaker pubs that do not serve food as the House knows

recognising how hard they have been hit by this virus in what is typically their busiest month.

We will also work with the hospitality sector in supporting their bounce back next year.

Mr Speaker I want to stress, that the situation is profoundly different now because there is an end in sight.

And I am not this afternoon seeking open-ended measures.

On the contrary, these regulations come with a sunset clause at the end of February, sorry at the end of the 2 February I should say Mr Speaker.

At that point we will have sufficient data to assess our position after Christmas,

and though I believe these types of restrictions will be needed until the Spring,

they can only be extended beyond 2 February if this House votes for them Mr Speaker.

These are points that have been made with great power as I say by Hon Members on all sides of the House.

We will review the allocation of tiers every fourteen days, starting on 16th December. I just want to make an important point to my Rt Hon friend and to all members who are rightly concerned about the position of their constituencies, our constituencies, in these tiers.

Hon Members have it in their powers, in our power to help move our areas down the tiers,

by throwing their full weight Mr Speaker, our full weight as leaders in our communities behind community testing,

and seizing the opportunity, seizing the opportunity to encourage as many people as possible to take part.

Of the kind we’ve seen in Liverpool Mr Speaker

where since the 6th November over 284,000 tests have been conducted,

and together with the effect of national restrictions,

the number of cases fell by more than two thirds. This is the model that I would recommend.

We are now proposing that from tomorrow Liverpool City Region and Warrington should be in tier 2, where as previously obviously they were in tier 3.

And we want other regions and other towns, cities, communities to follow this path,

And that is why – with the help of our fantastic armed forces –

we will be offering community testing to tier 3 areas as quickly as possible.

Mr Speaker let me just say, I find it extraordinary that the Official Opposition –represented by the gentleman opposite -

Currently have no view on the way ahead and are not proposing to vote tonight.

I do think it is extraordinary that in spite of the barrage of criticism that we have no credible plan from the party opposite. Indeed, we have no view on the way ahead. It’s a quite extraordinary thing Mr Speaker that tonight to the best of my knowledge

The RHG Opposite who has always said he will ‘act in the national interest’ has told his party to sit on its hands and to abstain in the vote tonight Mr Speaker.

And I think the government has made its decision, we’ve taken some tough decisions Mr Speaker and the Labour opposition has decided tonight heroically to abstain Mr Speaker

And I think when the history of this pandemic comes to be written, I think the people of this country will observe that instead of having politicians of all parties coming together in the national interest they had one party taking the decisions and another party heroically deciding to abstain

Mr Speaker, in the story of 2020, I think there are two great feats in which we can take a great deal of comfort.

First, our country has come together in an extraordinary effort that has so far succeeded in protecting our NHS and in saving many lives.

And while our scientists have been zeroing in on the weaknesses of Covid,

telescoping ten years of work into ten months,

and now their endeavours are about to deliver the means as I say to rout the virus. That is clear.

The Government is backing not one potential vaccine, but seven.

We have ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, that is now seeking regulatory approval.

We have ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which has almost 95 per cent effectiveness in trials.

And Mr Speaker, we have ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which

if approved by the regulator –

could start being administered before Christmas.

In total, Mr Speaker our Vaccines Task Force has secured more than 350 million doses,

more than enough for everyone in the UK, the Crown Dependencies and our Overseas Territories.

All we need to do now Mr Speaker is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp,

and indeed being injected into our arms.

So I say to the House again let us follow the guidance, let us roll out mass testing, let’s work to deliver mass testing to the people of our country, let’s work together to control the virus and it is in that spirit that I commend these regulations Mr Speaker I commend these regulations to the House.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-12-01,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-coronavirus-regulations-1-december-2020"
"5","Speech","An update on the coronavirus vaccine, 2 December 2020","Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock gave a statement to the House of Commons about the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine.","Mr Speaker, with permission I’d like to make a statement about the coronavirus vaccine.

Today marks a new chapter in our fight against this virus. Ever since this pandemic hit our shores, almost a year ago, we have known that a vaccine would be critical to set us free.

So all through this arduous year ‒ and it has been an arduous year while we’ve been working night and day to fight the virus and keep it under control ‒ we have been striving too, to develop the vaccines that can give us hope and let us eventually release the curbs on our freedoms that have bound us for so long.

Thanks to the incredible work of the Vaccines Taskforce, the Business Secretary and Kate Bingham, we have already amassed a huge portfolio of different vaccine candidates.

We’ve backed 7 vaccines, and ordered 357 million doses on behalf of the whole of the UK, one of the biggest portfolios per capita in the world.

We have said from the start that a vaccine must be safe and effective, before we would even consider deploying.

Any vaccine must go through a rigorous process of clinical trials involving thousands of people, and extensive independent scrutiny from the MHRA, one of the world’s most respected medical regulators.

Today, I am delighted to inform the House that the MHRA has issued the clinical authorisation of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. This is a monumental step forward. It’s no longer if there’s a vaccine, it’s when. In our battle against the virus, help is on its way.

Today is a triumph for all those who believe in science, a triumph for ingenuity and a triumph for humanity. I want to thank everyone who has played their part in this achievement. The team at Pfizer and BioNTech, the volunteers who stepped up and took part in clinical trials and to the MHRA themselves who have made sure that this is a vaccine that we can all have faith in.

Thanks to their efforts, I can confirm that the UK is the first country in the world to have a clinically approved coronavirus vaccine for supply.

And now, our task is to make use of the fruits of this scientific endeavour, to save lives.

Deployment

Mr Speaker, we have spent months preparing for this day, so that as soon as we got the green light we would be ready to go.

We were the first country in the world to pre-order supplies of this successful vaccine and we have 40 million doses pre-ordered for delivery over the coming months, enough for 20 million people, because 2 jabs are required each.

Following authorisation, the next stage is to test each batch of the vaccine for safety.

I can confirm that batch testing has been completed this morning for the first deployment of 800,000 doses of the vaccine. These doses are for the whole UK.

This morning I chaired a meeting of health ministers from the devolved administrations to ensure the roll-out effort is co-ordinated nationwide.

This will be one of the biggest civilian logistical efforts that we have faced as a nation. It will be difficult. There will be challenges and complications. But I know the NHS is equal to the task.

Rolling out a vaccine free at the point of delivery, according to clinical need, not ability to pay, is in the finest tradition of our National Health Service.

And I am delighted to confirm that the NHS will be able to start vaccinating from early next week.

The whole purpose of the vaccine is to protect people from covid so we can get our lives back to normal. So, we will prioritise the groups who are at greatest risk.

This morning, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has published its advice, setting out the order of priority according to that clinical need.

This includes care home residents and their carers, the over-80s, and the frontline health and social care workers.

We will deliver according to clinical prioritisation and operational necessity because the need to hold the vaccine at minus-70 makes this vaccine particularly challenging to deploy.

While we will begin vaccination next week, the bulk of the vaccinations will be in the new year. But I would urge anyone called forward for vaccination by the NHS to respond quickly, to protect themselves, their loved ones and their community.

Mr Speaker, over the next few months we will see vaccines delivered in 3 different ways.

First, we will begin vaccination in hospital hubs.

Second, we will deploy through local community services, including GPs and in due course pharmacies too.

And, third, we will stand up vaccination centres in conference centres and sports venues, to vaccinate large numbers of people as more vaccines come on stream.

This is an important step. But we are not there yet.

And so we must all play our part, and keep following the new rules that this House approved overwhelmingly yesterday. And remember the basics, like hands, face, space and get a test, that we know from experience are so important in keeping this virus under control.

Care homes

Before I finish, Mr Speaker, can I also update the House on another bit of good news.

From today, I am absolutely thrilled to say that we can safely allow visits in care homes, subject to visitors testing negative for COVID-19.

Coronavirus has denied so many people the simple pleasure of seeing a loved one, which is so precious to so many, especially in our care homes.

This is only possible because of the success we’ve had in building one of the biggest testing capacities in Europe. And with local and national teams working together side by side, something we have often discussed across this house.

We have worked hard on testing, and we’ve worked hard on the vaccine. Our strategy of suppressing the virus until a vaccine can make us safe – that strategy is working.

And I’m delighted that we can now bring families and friends together ahead of Christmas thanks to this improvement.

Conclusion

Mr Speaker, this is a day to remember, in a year to forget. We can see the way out. But we’re not there yet.

So let’s keep our resolve, keep doing our bit, to keep people safe, until science can set us free.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-12-02,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/an-update-on-the-coronavirus-vaccine-2-december-2020"

Welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.

Today I’m joined by Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty and Professor Kevin Fenton, Public Health England’s Regional Director for London.

Sadly, the news on the spread of the virus is not good.

The latest number of cases of coronavirus is rising once more.

We’ve seen an increase of 14% in the last week and the number of patients admitted to hospital across the UK has risen again too.

The average number of new cases reported each day is 18,023 which is up on last week.

Today, there are 16,531 COVID patients in hospitals across the UK – which is also up.

And sadly, on average each day over the past week 420 deaths have been reported

Once again, the spread of this disease is not even across the country. There have been sharp rises in South Wales, London, Kent, Essex and parts of the East and South East of England.

In some areas, the doubling time is now 7 days, this rise is amongst people of all age groups – not just school-age children.

I’m particularly concerned by the rising rates amongst the over 60s, the number of people in hospital which is also rising. That’s even before that we factor in the increases in last week’s rates.

And we know, through painful experience: more cases lead to more hospitalisations and sadly, more deaths.

To think that this link and this chain is broken is wrong and dangerous.

We’ve seen it time and time again elsewhere this year when cases rise, the pressure on hospitals mount. And so to then sadly, do the number of people who die from coronavirus

To stop this, we need to act fast.

I can tell you that because of the testing and surveillance systems that we built, we’ve also identified a new variant of this virus which may be associated with the faster spread in some areas.

We deal with this variant just like we do with all the others and this underlines how important it is for us to be vigilant.

The vaccine is being rolled out – and it’s wonderful to see that tens of thousands of people have had their jabs, their first jabs and it’s also very good to see that the vaccine, as of today, is being rolled out by GPs in England and to care homes in Scotland.

Help is on its way. But we’re not there yet.

To control this deadly disease while the vaccine is being rolled out, we all have a role to play.

Everyone should minimise their social contact, because that’s how we can control the spread of this disease.

Turning to London and south and west Essex, and south Hertfordshire – in these areas we have seen sharp exponential rises in the past week we have taken swift and decisive action to protect the NHS and save lives even ahead of the formal review point on Wednesday.

We must act now.

So, from one minute from midnight on Wednesday morning these areas will move into Tier 3 – the very high alert level.

I know this is not the news people wanted – it’s a blow to so many people who have made plans and to businesses that will be adversely affected too.

But we know from experience: the best thing to do in the face of this virus is to act fast and not wait to see the growth continue.

And we do not rule out further action.

This rise in transmission – as well as the new variant of COVID – should be a warning to us all that – even after such a difficult year – we must stay vigilant.

People of all ages can spread this disease and around 1 in 3 people don’t display any symptoms at all. But can still spread it.

We should never lose sight of our own role in this – our personal responsibility.

Each and every one of us to respect the rules where you are don’t ease up on those simple steps that keep us safe: like hands, face, and space. The social distancing that we need. And to come forward and get a test.

This moment is a salutary warning for the whole country – this isn’t over yet.

Please play your part and do all you can to stop the spread of this disease.

I’ll now turn to Professor Whitty to turn to the data and the details.

It is almost a year since humanity has been tormented by COVID

Across the world, economic output has plummeted and a million and a half people have died

And all the time we have waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy

And give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill – and now the scientists have done it

And they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine from an idea that was pioneered in this country by Edward Jenner in 1796

And today we can announce that the government has accepted the recommendation

from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency

to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for distribution across the United Kingdom.

after months of clinical trials,

involving thousands of people

to ensure that the vaccine meets the strictest, internationally recognised, standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.

Thanks to the fantastic work of Kate Bingham and the Vaccines Task Force,

we purchased more than 350 million doses of seven different vaccine candidates,

and the UK was the first country in the world to pre-order supplies of this Pfizer vaccine

securing 40 million doses.

Through our Winter Plan, the NHS has been preparing for the biggest programme of mass vaccination in the history of the UK.

And that is going to begin next week,

and in line with the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation

the first phase will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable,

But there are immense logistical challenges:

the vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees

and each person needs two injections, three weeks apart.

So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected,

Long and cold months

So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with over optimism

Or fall into the naïve belief that the struggle is over

Its not, we’ve got to stick to our Winter Plan,

a comprehensive programme to suppress the virus, protect the NHS and the vulnerable,

keep education and the economy going

and use treatments, testing and vaccines to enable us to return to much closer to normal by spring.

Today in England we have ended national restrictions, opening up significant parts of the economy in doing so;

but also replacing them with tough tiers to keep this virus down.

And I know that those tiers will mean continued hardship for many, and it is going to continue to be tough for some sectors

but until the vaccine is deployed, our plan does rely on all of us continuing to make sacrifices to protect those we love.

So please, please continue to follow the rules where you live,

remember hands, face, space –

and if you live in a tier 3 area where community testing will be made available, please take part in that community testing.

Together, these steps are for now the surest way to protect yourselves and those you love

and by reducing the transmission of the virus, help de-escalate your area to a lower level of restrictions,

as vaccines and testing, as I say, take an ever larger share of the burden.

And as we do all this,

we are no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring,

but rather on the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed:

and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love

So I want to thank the scientists and all those around the world who have taken part in the trials and got us to this stage","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-12-02,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-2-december-2020"
"8","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 March 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the nation on coronavirus.","Good Evening,

The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone.

All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer.

And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help.

And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have.

Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses.

And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger.

To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from Coronavirus but from other illnesses as well.

So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease.

Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope - and save more lives.

And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic.

And though huge numbers are complying - and I thank you all - the time has now come for us all to do more.

From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction -  you must stay at home.

Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households.

That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes:

shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible
  one form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household;
  any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person; and
  travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home.
That’s all - these are the only reasons you should leave your home.

You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No.

You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.

You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can.

If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately:

close all shops selling non-essential goods,​ including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship;
  we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with;
  and we’ll stop all social events​, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals.
Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed.

No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this.

I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs.

And that’s why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business.

And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to.

But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost.

And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through.

Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with 7500 former clinicians now coming back to the service.

With the time you buy - by simply staying at home - we are increasing our stocks of equipment.

We are accelerating our search for treatments.

We are pioneering work on a vaccine.

And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer.

I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus.

Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline.

But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted.

Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together.

To halt the spread of this disease.

To protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives.

And I know that as they have in the past so many times.

The people of this country will rise to that challenge.

And we will come through it stronger than ever.

We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together.

And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives.

Thank you.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-03-23,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-23-march-2020"
"9","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 31 October 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a statement at the coronavirus press conference.","Good evening and apologies for disturbing your Saturday evening with more news of Covid and I can assure you I wouldn’t do it unless it was absolutely necessary.

First I will hand over to Chris and then Patrick who will present the latest data.


Data Presentation


Thank you very much Patrick, and Chris. I am afraid that no responsible PM can ignore the message of those figures.

When I told you two weeks ago that we were pursuing a local and a regional approach to tackling this virus, I believed then and I still believe passionately that it was the right thing to do.

Because we know the cost of these restrictions, the damage they do, the impact on jobs, and on livelihoods, and on people’s mental health.

No one wants to be imposing these kinds of measures anywhere.

We didn’t want to be shutting businesses, pubs and restaurants in one part of the country, where incidence was very low, when the vast bulk of infections were taking place elsewhere.

Our hope was that by strong local action, strong local leadership, we could get the rates of infection down where the disease was surging, and address the problem thereby across the whole country.

And I want to thank the millions of people who have been putting up with these restrictions in their areas for so long. I want to thank local leaders who have stepped up and local communities.

Because as you can see from some of those charts, the R has been kept lower than it would otherwise have been, and there are signs that your work has been paying off

And we will continue as far as we possibly can to adopt a pragmatic and local approach in the months ahead

But as we’ve also seen from those charts, we’ve got to be humble in the face of nature

And in this country alas as across much of Europe the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst case scenario of our scientific advisers

Whose models as you’ve just seen now suggest that unless we act we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day

A peak of mortality alas far bigger than the one we saw in April

Even in the South West, where incidence was so low, and still is so low, it is now clear that current projections mean they will run out of hospital capacity in a matter of weeks unless we act.

And let me explain why the overrunning of the NHS would be a medical and moral disaster beyond the raw loss of life

Because the huge exponential growth in the number of patients – by no means all of them elderly, by the way – would mean that doctors and nurses would be forced to choose which patients to treat

Who would get oxygen and who wouldn’t

Who would live and who would die,

And doctors and nurses would be forced to choose between saving covid patients and non-covid patients

And the sheer weight of covid demand would mean depriving tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of non-covid patients of the care they need

It is crucial to grasp this that the general threat to public health comes not from focusing too much on covid, but from not focusing enough, from failing to get it under control

And if we let the lines on those graphs grow in the way they could and in the way they’re projected to grow, then the risk is that for the first time in our lives, the NHS will not be there for us and for our families

And even if I could now double capacity overnight – and obviously I am proud that we have massively increased capacity, we do have the Nightingales, we’ve got 13,000 more nurses now than last year, we have many more doctors – but it still would not be enough, because the virus is doubling faster than we could conceivably add capacity

And so now is the time to take action because there is no alternative.

From Thursday until the start of December, you must stay at home.

You may only leave home for specific reasons, including:

For education;
For work, say if you cannot work from home;
For exercise and recreation outdoors, with your household or on your own with one person from another household;
For medical reasons, appointments and to escape injury or harm;
To shop for food and essentials;
And to provide care for vulnerable people, or as a volunteer.

I’m afraid non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues will all be closed – though click and collect services can continue and essential shops will remain open, so there is no need to stock up.

Pubs, bars, restaurants must close except for takeaway and delivery services.

Workplaces should stay open where people can’t work from home – for example in the construction or manufacturing sectors.

Single adult households can still form exclusive support bubbles with one other household, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated.

If you are clinically vulnerable, or over the age of 60, you should be especially careful to follow the rules and minimise your contacts with others.

I know how tough shielding was, and we will not ask people to shield again in the same way again. However we are asking those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to minimise their contact with others, and not to go to work if they are unable to work from home.

I am under no illusions about how difficult this will be for businesses which have already had to endure hardship this year. I am truly, truly sorry for that.

This is why we are also going to extend the furlough system through November. The furlough scheme was a success in the spring. It supported people and businesses in a critical time. We will not end it. We will extend it until December.

There will be some differences compared to March.

These measures above all will be time-limited, starting next Thursday 5 November. They will end on Wednesday 2 December, when we will seek to ease restrictions, going back into the tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends.

Christmas is going to be different this year, very different, but it is my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now, we can allow families across the country to be together.

My priority, our priority, remains keeping people in education - so childcare, early years settings, schools, colleges and universities will all remain open. Our senior clinicians still advise that school is the best place for children to be.

We cannot let this virus damage our children’s futures even more than it has already. I urge parents to continue taking their children to school and I am extremely grateful to teachers across the country for their dedication in enabling schools to remain open.

And it is vital that we will keep provision for non-Covid healthcare groups going.

So please - this is really important - unless your clinicians tell you otherwise, you should continue to use the NHS, get your scans, turn up for your appointments and pick up your treatments. If at all possible, we want you to continue to access these services, now and through the winter. Indeed it’s only by taking this action that we can protect the NHS for you.

On Monday I will set out our plans to parliament. On Wednesday, parliament will debate and vote on these measures which, if passed, will as I say come into force on Thursday.

We have updated the devolved administrations on the action we are taking in England and stand ready to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond.

We should remember we are not alone in what we’re going through. Our friends in Belgium, France and Germany have had to take very similar action.

So as we come together now to fight this second wave, I want to say something about the way ahead

Because people will reasonably ask when will this all end

And as I have said before I am optimistic that this will feel very different and better by the spring

It is not just that we have ever better medicine and therapies, and the realistic hope of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year

We now have the immediate prospect of using many millions of cheap, reliable and above all rapid turnaround tests

Tests that you can use yourself to tell whether or not you are infectious and get the result within ten to 15 minutes

And we know from trial across the country in schools and hospitals that we can use these tests not just to locate infectious people but to drive down the disease

And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests

Applying them in an ever-growing number of situations

From helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when they’re giving birth to testing whole towns and even whole cities

The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days

Working with local communities, local government, public health directors and organisations of all kinds to help people discover whether or not they are infectious, and then immediately to get them to self-isolate and to stop the spread

And I can tell you tonight that the scientists may be unanimously gloomy about the immediate options

But they are unanimously optimistic about the medium and the long term future

We will get through this – but we must act now to contain this autumn surge

We are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April

It is less prohibitive and less restrictive

But from Thursday the basic message is the same

Stay at home. Protect the NHS. And save lives.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-10-31,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-31-october-2020"

We now have reason to hope that by Spring, community testing and vaccines will combine to end this era of restrictions.

But to get there we must first navigate a hard winter when the burden on our NHS is heaviest and the cold weather favours the virus.

The data already suggests national measures in England have slowed - and in some places reversed - the growth of new cases.

As more data comes in, we hope and expect to see those trends continue.

Together we have prevented our NHS from being overwhelmed,

but those dangers have not gone away.

If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again,

casting aside our hard won gains,

and forcing us back into a New Year national lockdown with all the damage that would mean.

The tough measures in our Winter Plan are the best way to avoid this outcome.

All our friends around the world are grappling with the same question of how to keep people safe without retreating into a winter of hibernation.

In Italy there is a nightly curfew,

in Germany, hospitality will remain closed until 20th December,

and in France, until 20 January.

Across the whole of the UK, measures remain in place to control the virus.

Under our Winter Plan, England will return to a tiered system of local restrictions.

Our decisions on which area enters which tier are based on public health advice according to five indicators:

cases across all ages,

especially the over 60s,

the rate by which cases are rising or falling

the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid

and the pressure on the NHS.

We are publishing data packs setting out the reasons behind decisions in each area.

To find out how this affects you, log on to gov.uk where all the information is available.

I’m sorry to confirm that, from Wednesday, most of England will be in the top two tiers with the toughest measures.

I know this will bring a great deal of heartache and frustration, especially for our vital hospitality sector,

our pubs, our restaurants, our hotels, in so many ways the soul of our communities -

which continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden.

I really wish it were otherwise, but if we are to keep schools open – as we must - then our options in bearing down on the disease are necessarily limited.

What we will do is continue taking every possible step to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK.

These tougher tiers strike a balance – they are sufficient to continue driving the virus downwards but it’s important to recognise they are less intrusive than the current national measures.

In all tiers, shops, gyms and the leisure sector, hairdressers, other forms of personal care, places of worship will reopen.

You will no longer be instructed to stay at home, though you should continue to work from home if you can.

The rule of 6 will once again apply in public outdoor spaces and organised outdoor sport can begin again.

But there is no doubt that the restrictions in all tiers are tough – and I am sorry about that.

While the data is beginning to improve, the virus is still prevalent, and the faster we drive it down the faster we can lift restrictions.

And that is exactly what these new tiers are designed to achieve.

While the previous tiers slowed the spread of the virus,

they were never quite enough to cut the R below 1 and keep it there,

so areas did not escape whatever level they were placed in.

Our new approach is designed to reduce R below 1,

opening a path for areas to move down the scale, as soon as the situation improves.

And crucially, we now have the means to accelerate that moment of escape with rapid community testing,

allowing anyone carrying the disease - including those without symptoms – to isolate

thereby reducing the R.

And the truth is that at least one in three people with Covid have no symptoms at all and may be spreading the disease without even knowing that they’ve got it.

The only way to identify them and protect everyone is through mass testing.

Liverpool shows what can be achieved.

In Liverpool, in the space of two and a half weeks, over 240,000 tests have been conducted

and together with the effect of national restrictions,

this has helped to reduce the number of cases in Liverpool City Region by more than two thirds.

So having previously been in tier 3, Liverpool City Region and Warrington will now be in tier 2.

This is a success story which we want other parts of the country to replicate

so we will work with local government, public health leaders and our fantastic Armed Forces,

to offer community testing to tier 3 areas as quickly as possible,

opening the way for them to follow Liverpool’s example.

Testing on this scale is untried, but in due course, if it works, where people test negative, it may also be possible for families and communities to be released from certain restrictions

even if their home area stays in tier 3.

The allocation of tiers will be reviewed every fourteen days, starting on 16 December.

So your tier is not your destiny.

Every area has the means of escape.

And I have no doubt that together we can get through this Winter,

suppress the virus until vaccines come to our aid,

and then reclaim our lives and all the things that we love.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-11-26,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-26-november-2020"
"11","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 March 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement on coronavirus.","Good afternoon everybody, thank you very much for coming. I wanted to bring everyone up to date with the national fight back against the new coronavirus and the decisions that we’ve just taken in COBR for the whole of the UK.

As we said last week, our objective is to delay and flatten the peak of the epidemic by bringing forward the right measures at the right time, so that we minimise suffering and save lives. And everything we do is based scrupulously on the best scientific advice.

Last week we asked everyone to stay at home if you had one of two key symptoms: a high temperature or a new and continuous cough.

Today, we need to go further, because according to SAGE [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] it looks as though we’re now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve.

And without drastic action, cases could double every 5 or 6 days.

So, first, we need to ask you to ensure that if you or anyone in your household has one of those two symptoms, then you should stay at home for fourteen days.

That means that if possible you should not go out even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. If necessary, you should ask for help from others for your daily necessities. And if that is not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies.

And even if you don’t have symptoms and if no one in your household has symptoms, there is more that we need you to do now.

So, second, now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.

We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues.

It goes without saying, we should all only use the NHS when we really need to. And please go online rather than ringing NHS 111.

Now, this advice about avoiding all unnecessary social contact, is particularly important for people over 70, for pregnant women and for those with some health conditions.

And if you ask, why are we doing this now, why now, why not earlier, or later? Why bring in this very draconian measure?

The answer is that we are asking people to do something that is difficult and disruptive of their lives.

And the right moment, as we’ve always said, is to do it when it is most effective, when we think it can make the biggest difference to slowing the spread of the disease, reducing the number of victims, reducing the number of fatalities.

And as we take these steps we should be focusing on the most vulnerable.

So third, in a few days’ time – by this coming weekend – it will be necessary to go further and to ensure that those with the most serious health conditions are largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks.

And again the reason for doing this in the next few days, rather than earlier or later, is that this is going to be very disruptive for people who have such conditions, and difficult for them, but, I believe, it’s now necessary.

And we want to ensure that this period of shielding, this period of maximum protection coincides with the peak of the disease.

And it’s now clear that the peak of the epidemic is coming faster in some parts of the country than in others.

And it looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead.

So, to relieve the pressure on the London health system and to slow the spread in London, it’s important that Londoners now pay special attention to what we are saying about avoiding non-essential contact, and to take particularly seriously the advice about working from home, and avoiding confined spaces such as pubs and restaurants.

Lastly, it remains true as we have said in the last few weeks that risks of transmission of the disease at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low.

But obviously, logically as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it is right that we should extend this advice to mass gatherings as well.

And so we’ve also got to ensure that we have the critical workers we need, that might otherwise be deployed at those gatherings, to deal with this emergency.

So from tomorrow, we will no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do. So mass gatherings, we are now moving emphatically away from.

And I know that many people – including millions of fit and active people over 70 – may feel, listening to what I have just said, that there is something excessive about these measures.

But I have to say, I believe that they are overwhelmingly worth it to slow the spread of the disease, to reduce the peak, to save life, minimise suffering and to give our NHS the chance to cope.

Over the last few days, I have been comparing notes and talking to leaders around the world and I can tell you that the UK is now leading a growing global campaign amongst all our friends and allies, whether in the G7, the G20, the UN, the IMF – all those bodies in which we play a significant role.

We’re leading a campaign to fight back against this disease.

To keep the economy growing, to make sure that humanity has access to the drugs and the treatments that we all need, and the UK is also at the front of the effort to back business, to back our economy, to make sure that we get through it.

I know that today we are asking a lot of everybody. It is far more now than just washing your hands - though clearly washing your hands remains important.

But I can tell you that across this country, people and businesses in my experience are responding with amazing energy and creativity to the challenge that we face, and I want to thank everybody for the part that you are playing and are going to play.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-03-16,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-16-march-2020"
"12","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 November 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a statement at the coronavirus press conference.","It seems that almost every week we learn of some new scientific breakthrough to help us beat Covid

last week it was good news about the vaccine from Pfizer BioNTech

and then Moderna

This morning we heard the fantastic news that the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine has been highly effective in clinical trials

there are more tests to be done, but the signs are that this vaccine

financed partly by British taxpayers, working in partnership with a great British company –
This vaccine could be both affordable and easy to use and highly effective

We have ordered 100m doses

and thanks to the work of the Vaccines Task Force we have secured more than 350m doses of potential vaccines of all kinds

but we are not out of the woods yet

we can hear the drumming hooves of the cavalry coming over the brow of the hill

but they are not here yet

Even if all three vaccines are approved, even if the production timetables are met and vaccines notoriously fall behind in their production timetables

it will be months before we can be sure that we have inoculated everyone that needs a vaccine

and those months will be hard

they will be cold

they include January and February when the NHS is under its greatest pressure

and that is why when we come out of lockdown next week we must not just throw away the gains we have all made

So today we have published out Covid Winter Plan which sets out a clear strategy to take the country through to the end of March

We will continue to bear down hard on this virus

we will use tough tiering - in some ways tougher than the pre-lockdown measures and details of those tiers are on the gov.uk website later this week when we have the most up to data and we will be sharing details of which tier your area is going to be in

I should warn you now that many more places will be in higher tiers than alas was previously the case

and we will simultaneously be using the new and exciting possibilities of community testing - as they have done in Liverpool

and there will be a clear incentive for everyone in areas where the virus prevalence is high to get a test, to get one of these rapid turnaround lateral flow tests and do your best for the community

get a test to help to squeeze the disease and reduce the restrictions that your town or city or area has endured

and that way - through tough tiering and mass community testing

we hope to let people see a little more of their family and friends over Christmas

Now I know that many of us want and need Christmas with our families

we feel after this year we deserve it

but this is not the moment to let the virus rip for the sake of Christmas parties

tis the season to be jolly but tis also the season to be jolly careful

especially with elderly relatives

and working with the Devolved Administrations we will set out shortly how we want to get the balance right for Christmas and we will be setting this out later this week

Christmas this year will be different and we want to remain prudent through Christmas and beyond into the new year

but we will use the three tools that I have described to squeeze the virus in the weeks and months ahead

tiering, testing and the roll-out of vaccines

employing all three techniques together so as to drive down R and drive down the infection rate

and I really am now assured things really will look and feel very different indeed after Easter

and that idea of and end goal or date is important because at last - if the promise of the vaccines is fulfilled - we do have something to work for

a timescale, a goal around which businesses can begin tentatively to plan

and with luck and with hard work we will be seeing improvements before then

but for now the problem is not a shortage of hope

or a lack of optimism

not with the amazing news that we are getting from the laboratories in this country

the challenge now as we face this difficult winter ahead

is to fight down any over-optimism

to master any tendency to premature celebration of success

that success will come all the faster if we work together to follow the guidance

maintain the basic disciplines as people have done so heroically over the last few months

hands, face, space and get a test if you have symptoms

because that is the way we will beat it together","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-11-23,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-23-november-2020"
"13","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 10 May 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the nation on coronavirus.","Prime Minister Boris Johnson has addressed the nation on coronavirus.

It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom – your freedom – of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war.

And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly.

You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing.

Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it’s the only way to defeat the coronavirus - the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime.

And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense.

And though we grieve for all those we have lost.

It is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst case scenario was half a million fatalities.

And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down.

And thanks to you we have protected our NHS and saved many thousands of lives.

And so I know - you know - that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike.

We must stay alert.

We must continue to control the virus and save lives.

And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life.

We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants.

And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing.

To their futures and the futures of their children.

So I want to provide tonight - for you - the shape of a plan to address both fears.

Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society.

A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed.

I will be setting out more details in Parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening.

I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK.

And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates.

And though it is right to be flexible in our response.

I believe that as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, there is a strong resolve to defeat this together.

And today a general consensus on what we could do.

And I stress could.

Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan.

And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests.

We must protect our NHS.

We must see sustained falls in the death rate.

We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection.

We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people who need it, and yes, it is a global problem but we must fix it.

And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.

And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.

And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases.

And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures.

The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.

There will be five alert levels.

Level One means the disease is no longer present in the UK and Level Five is the most critical – the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed.

Over the period of the lockdown we have been in Level Four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three.

And as we go everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down.

By staying alert and following the rules.

And to keep pushing the number of infections down there are two more things we must do.

We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done.

And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts.

So that – all told - we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day.

We have made fast progress on testing – but there is so much more to do now, and we can.

When this began, we hadn’t seen this disease before, and we didn’t fully understand its effects.

With every day we are getting more and more data.

We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes.

Because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups – in your area – as well as giving us a national picture.

And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below one.

And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given.

We have by no means fulfilled all of them.

And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week.

Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures.

And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week.

We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must.

We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.

And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible – because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited.

So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can’t work from home.

And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure.

And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards.

And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.

You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.

You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them.

And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further.

In step two – at the earliest by June 1 – after half term – we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6.

Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.

And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.

Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity.
We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health.

And I must stress again that all of this is conditional, it all depends on a series of big Ifs.
It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.

And to prevent re-infection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission significantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air.

And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective.

And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes.

We have been through the initial peak – but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous.

We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need.

But in the end this is a plan that everyone must make work.

And when I look at what you have done already.

The patience and common sense you have shown.

The fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can.

The incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS staff, our care workers.

The devotion and self-sacrifice of all those in every walk of life who are helping us to beat this disease.

Police, bus drivers, train drivers, pharmacists, supermarket workers, road hauliers, bin collectors, cleaners, security guards, postal workers, our teachers and a thousand more.

The scientists who are working round the clock to find a vaccine.

When I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country.

And that have helped to get us through this first phase.

I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next.

And if we can’t do it by those dates, and if the alert level won’t allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right.

We will come back from this devilish illness.

We will come back to health, and robust health.

And though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before.
More resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and more sharing.

But for now we must stay alert, control the virus and save lives.

Thank you very much.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-05-10,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-10-may-2020"
"14","Speech","Amanda Spielman launches Ofsted's Annual Report 2019/20","The Chief Inspector spoke at the launch of Ofsted's 2019 to 2020 Annual Report on education, children's services and skills.","Thank you all, for coming to this virtual launch of my annual report. As you are having to watch on a screen, I’m going to be briefer than usual.

Many of you will be listening out for your area of interest, but today I’m going to talk more generally, but with a particular slant towards schools. There is of course a great deal to read in the report about all of the areas in which we work. And I’ve also asked colleagues to record short videos with their reflections on the year. So after this launch, you can follow up on early years, social care, independent schools, unregulated schools, further education and skills, and on special educational needs, all on the Ofsted YouTube channel.


Read Ofsted’s Annual Report 2019/2020 and our press release.


Every year, this speech is a bit of a balancing act, between what is covered in the report, which is of course about the previous academic year, and more recent developments.

And, of course, this year the contrast between the first 6 months of that year, and the period since, could hardly be starker. Talking about 2019? Right now, that feels like reminiscing about halcyon days.

The pandemic isn’t just a colossal disruption. It’s also bringing out truths about our society. It has been so hard for so many people in so many ways: losing people we love, losing livelihoods, losing freedoms, losing the things that motivate us, losing everyday pleasures and joy.

But it’s also given us new insights into how we work together – and into how our institutions interact with us, and with each other. Truths that we might previously have suspected, and are now confirmed and laid bare.

As I’ve reflected on 2020, it’s the breadth of the role of schools that stands out. Closing schools to most pupils had an enormous impact. The decision caused a great splash, the boat is still rocking, and we don’t yet know quite how far the ripples will go.

The crisis has really shown us how important schools are to the fabric of society, given how much they now do beyond their core educational purpose.

Education has been compulsory for less than 150 years. For most of its history, it’s been a relatively simple business for most children: reading, writing, arithmetic and religious instruction. Until relatively recently, most schools had no conception of any wider role. Historically speaking, it’s quite a new thing for schools to be more than places of education.

But the COVID crisis really has shown how much is now expected of schools.

I was reminded of this a few weeks ago when I was being interviewed about our autumn visits. We’ve been visiting nurseries, schools, colleges, children’s homes and local authorities, and this has informed a series of reports, with more to come. The most recent set attracted a lot of attention, and for good reason.

Because school and nursery leaders had reported that some children had actually regressed through lockdown. Time didn’t just stand still for them; it went backwards. I can give some examples from our reports. Potty-trained children returning in the autumn back in nappies; and children who had learned to hold and use a pencil properly having lost that skill.

Education standards for older children had also suffered – for example, a loss of stamina when it came to reading and writing.

Some commentators were outraged, and fumed about schools and nurseries having to make up for gaps in parenting. And I have in the past pointed out that too many children reach primary school age without being potty-trained – but that wasn’t the issue here. And blame is not the point either. It’s about the impact of an event that has disrupted families, nurseries and schools.

What closures have reminded us about here is the importance of consolidation in learning. The knowledge and skills that matter aren’t learned instantly. They have to be practiced and reinforced – ideally both at home and in school.

Some children have thrived in lockdown – the ones whose parents could be at home, work flexibly, weren’t too distracted by younger siblings, and could help with remote learning. But many households just don’t have that kind of capacity and flexibility. These children also missed out on the time they’d usually have with teachers and staff at school or nursery. They haven’t had the chance to consolidate recent learning.

And by the way, this picture is not unique to England: we’ve been hearing from our counterparts across Europe that it’s looking similar elsewhere.

I do want to say, however, that while it is very clear that there is ‘learning loss’ in the short term, it is simply too early to say what the long-term impact will be. There have been some alarming extrapolations. But the most important thing is to get on with the job of teaching children, whether it’s the things they learn at home or at school. Good parenting and good teaching will fill most of the gaps for most children.

But we also saw the dramatic impact of school closures in falling referrals to children’s social care. Teachers are often the eyes that spot signs of abuse and the ears that hear stories of neglect. Closing schools didn’t just leave the children who – unbeknown to others – suffer at home without respite: it also took them out of sight of those who could help.

I want to talk about these ‘out of sight’ children a bit more, as they concern us all.

When nurseries and schools closed in March, they were told to remain open to the most vulnerable – which of course meant those whose need was already identified. And even of these, we know that relatively few actually attended. The rest stayed at home – some, inevitably, in harm’s way.

There was a concerted effort to reach these children, with partnership working across England. Many of our staff moved temporarily into local authorities to help. It’s worth noting that the COVID challenge has given new impetus to partnership working across education and social care.

But even with the best efforts of so many, attendance remained stubbornly low.

And even now, while referrals have been rising, they are still below previous levels. We don’t know why – perhaps in part because of the current constraints on how schools operate.

Our autumn briefings have also covered headteachers’ reports of children who haven’t returned at all. Some parents have removed children, to educate them at home. And it appears they have done this mostly because of concerns around COVID, rather than a new-found enthusiasm for home schooling. A recent survey by the Association of Directors of Children’s Services shows an increase of nearly 40% since this time last year, taking the number of children believed to be home schooled above 75,000.

And a significant proportion of the children who have come off school rolls are already known to one or more external children’s services – because they have special needs, previous attendance issues or other interventions in their lives. And almost all children, vulnerable or otherwise, are missing out on a lot when they aren’t at school. (And yes, I do know there are exceptions here – but they are exceptions.) Some will have a great experience, but other families will find it harder than they thought, and their children could lose out as a result.

We must be alive to these risks, and we must also watch out for bad practices creeping back in that could compound risk. We don’t want to see any schools off-rolling children; and we need all schools to make the effort to help children with SEND to attend.

We know that many SEND children and their parents particularly struggled during lockdown, as many services were withdrawn.

Of course, safeguarding has been a core responsibility of schools for many years. That’s not getting any easier. And schools are now expected to address wider health concerns. Our reports show that children’s physical fitness has suffered from lockdown. School leaders told us that children came back less active and less fit. This highlights the importance of physical education and school sport.

If we look back, school sport was once about finding a new talent, developing teamwork and even building moral fibre, as much as about physical fitness. Now it’s also one of the ways schools contribute to countering childhood obesity – alongside the school canteen, which we expect to serve up healthy, nutritious and affordable meals.

And there are social concerns besides obesity that have become interwoven with schooling. Understandable concerns about youth crime and violence, for example, have driven some to decry the use of exclusion as part of a school’s approach to maintaining behaviour, and expect mainstream schools to find all the answers.

We all expect teachers to maintain a calm and orderly learning environment. It’s critical for children, it’s valued by parents and, yes, it’s scrutinised by Ofsted. So schools devise strategies to teach and manage behaviour. Exclusion is the ultimate sanction, to be used only in extremis.

But calls to ban it entirely, on the argument that excluded children can be drawn into crime, presents challenges. Trying to address such a complex social issue, by constraining schools to this extent, risks losing sight of the needs of classmates, teachers and even of excluded children themselves, at a point that no-one has yet worked out what will meet their needs.

Education, of course, has intrinsic value – and now we expect it to keep accelerating social mobility.

And increasingly we see efforts to commandeer schools and the curriculum in support of worthy social issues and campaigns. In the last year, many of these calls have been about environmental causes and against racism.

Climate change activists have called for new qualifications or more explicit alterations to the curriculum. They sometimes forget the importance of grounding climate change within the wider body of learning about science and about geography. And they don’t always notice how much schools already do in this space.

And last month, The Times published research findings that black and minority ethnic Britons see changes in education as the most effective way to address their concerns. When asked what policy changes would make the most difference to ethnic minority lives in Britain, the top answer was ‘a more diverse school curriculum’.

Why is that? Is it because there is a fundamental issue with the national curriculum that limits exposure to diversity in literature, history, or geography? Or is it because there’s a widely held and justifiable assumption that changing things in school is the key to changing wider social attitudes?

And of course social change is difficult. We have seen friction in some schools, where, for example, lessons making children aware that loving relationships exist between same-sex couples conflict with some parents’ religious beliefs. They argue that the curriculum has moved too far in the name of equality, and that it now infringes on their religious freedoms.

I’m not making a moral point here, but rather a practical one. Schools are the go-to solution, perhaps more than any other institution in society. The arguments are often impassioned and well-constructed. Most significantly, perhaps, they are often amplified by thousands of voices, using social media, online petitions and by well-meaning commentators.

Treating schools as the great panacea of our time underlines the importance of education, but it doesn’t make it any easier to run a school. The pressure on schools to do more than teach their current curriculum continues to grow.

And, of course, COVID has added another layer of complexity. Schools must now be experts in limiting the spread of an invisible infection, organising themselves around complicated and shifting sets of health rules.

And when it’s impossible to have children at school, they are also expected to switch seamlessly to remote education, and to maintain the pace and precision of their curriculum delivery, to pupils who are away from the teachers’ gaze and susceptible to all the temptations of home. This is a very big ask. And by the way, none of us should be seduced by the idea that remote education can match the classroom for most children; it’s a lot better than nothing, but for most, it can’t match it.

And this isn’t just about social or technological inequalities. In many instances, it’s about motivation – the same issue that dogs so many adults adjusting to working from home. Nevertheless, just as schools have adapted to so much else, now they must adapt to this new reality too.

In many ways, schools are the victim of their own success. They’re far removed from Victorian incarnations. They play critical roles in children’s educational, physical and social development. They’re a crucial part of the care system that protects the vulnerable, and they support children with a whole range of needs. They do far more than they are often given credit for.

It’s a good moment to thank all of you who work in education and in social care, as you continue to do your level best at a time of great pressure and uncertainty.

I’ve outlined where I think schools are. And I return to the question I asked at the start: are we getting the balance right? Do we want schools to have such extensive roles beyond education: as the community hub; as the triage point for support services and intervention; as the go-to solution for social problems; as the guardian of children’s waistlines?

And if we do, are we giving schools the tools and capacity to do those jobs well, and leaving them enough time and headspace for the core job of education?

The COVID crisis has stress-tested so many parts of our society, and education and social care are feeling that stress. As we look forward in hope of a better year ahead, I hope there will be time to consider these questions.

I know that some of my audience will see the impact of COVID as a reason why Ofsted shouldn’t return to school inspections for a while yet.  And I know that school leaders have been looking for certainty. I’m expecting the government to make an announcement about this very soon, as it is ultimately their decision.

But I’m not expecting us to be doing graded inspections from January. We need to take account of the national situation, and indeed we’ve always said that the timing of our return was under review, and also the form of our inspections. We do understand what teachers are going through. Though with such positive news about vaccines, we are all hoping for a return to some sense of normality not too far into 2021.

But I must remind you, we also know what children are going through. We owe it to them to have good provision for them, wherever they are. And where it isn’t, this needs to be known about.

The normal scrutiny within the system has been absent for a good while now, and it does need to be reintroduced next year – and that includes schools formerly covered by the outstanding exemption, now removed.

And of course, it also includes the other sectors we look at – all of which play such crucial roles in children’s lives: childminders, nurseries, colleges, children’s homes, fostering and adoption agencies – the list goes on. And older learners too, whether post-16 students or apprentices; adults looking to retrain; or prisoners wanting to transform their future through education. Our role for all of these is to raise standards and improve lives – and that’s why it’s important that we are able to return to our work next year.

But when we do return, we will not be looking at the challenges of the first lockdown and we will not be expecting people to have performed miracles, but rather to have done their best in the circumstances. Because we all want to do what’s in children’s best interests.

Our autumn visits led us to a clear conclusion: keeping schools open is unbelievably important. I wholeheartedly support the government’s stance on this, through this second lockdown.

We must not deprive children of all that schools do and all that schools are. And if we are serious in that aim, we must carry on aiming for the same standards as before this virus arrived, though in the short term we all know that trade-offs must inevitably be made.

In this collective endeavour, we will play our part. We always remember that education should be about broadening minds and enriching communities and advancing civilisation: in short, about leaving the world a better place than we found it. We will carry on working to help preserve and promote the standards of education and care that this generation needs and has every right to expect.","Ofsted and Amanda Spielman",2020-12-01,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/amanda-spielman-launches-ofsteds-annual-report-201920"
"15","Speech","Chief Scientific Advisor and Chief Medical Officer briefing on coronavirus (COVID-19): 21 September 2020","Sir Patrick Vallance and Professor Chris Whitty gave a data briefing on coronavirus.","Sir Patrick Vallance, Government Chief Scientific Adviser:

Good morning everybody. I’m Patrick Vallance, the government Chief Scientific Adviser and I’m here with Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer and we wanted to give you an update on where we see the epidemic at the moment, some of the knowns and some of the uncertainties.

Let me just start by reminding you that this disease spreads by droplets, by surface contact and by aerosols. Hence the hands, face, space but also to remind you that the way that we reduce the spread is by limiting our number of contacts, by reducing contact in environments where spread is more likely. Those are crowded environments, indoor environments, poor ventilation. And making sure that we reduce the probability of coming into contact with anyone who is infectious and that’s the importance of self isolation, keeping out of circulation if you have or may have the virus. May I have the first slide please?

I want to start by talking about the rise in cases elsewhere and what we can learn. We’ve seen increase in cases across Europe, and here I’ve taken examples of Spain and France. We have seen an increase in the numbers of cases. It started with younger people in their twenties and spread gradually to older ages as well. That increase in case number has translated into an increase in hospitalisations. As the hospitalisations have increased, as you look at the slide on the right here, you will see that very sadly but not unexpectedly, deaths are also increasing. So there’s a simple message from this slide, which is that as the disease spreads, as it spreads across age groups, we expect to see increase in hospitalisations and unfortunately those increase in hospitalisations will lead to an increase in deaths. The virus has genetically moved a bit but it has not changed in terms of its propensity and its ability to cause disease and to cause death, even though of course most of the disease deaths occur in the older population. So where are we here? Next slide, please.

These are data from testing and I’ll come back to that point in a minute and they’re data for England but the picture is fairly similar across the UK and, and Chris Whitty will say more about that. What we see from July, as we look at the increase in cases per 100,000 of population, an increase which has occurred over August and has increased into September. This is by different age groups and the top line, the blue line is amongst the 20 to 29-year-olds. But what you can see is there has been an increase in cases across all age groups. The lowest increase has been in children and in the population aged 70 to 79 but in every age group we’ve seen an increase. Could that increase be due to increased testing? The answer is no. We see an increase in positivity of the tests done, so we see the proportion of people testing positive has increased even if testing stays flat. And if we look at other sources of data such as, for example, the ONS study which takes a sample of people across the population and looks at it or studies like the REACT study we see a similar increase. In the ONS study, it’s now estimated that roughly 70,000 people in the UK have Covid infection and that about 6,000 people per day are getting the infection. So we are in a situation where numbers are clearly increasing. They’re increasing across all age groups. It’s a little bit different in different areas, in terms of geographies and Chris will speak to that and this increase in numbers is also translating into an increase in hospitalisation, which Chris will say more about. So there’s no doubt we are in a situation where the numbers are increasing. What I’d like to do is just remind you how quickly this can move. So the next slide is not a prediction, but it is a way of thinking about how quickly this can change.

So this is the UK reported cases per day against time and you can see running along the bottom there the number of cases over June, July and August. Up to roughly 3,000 cases per day or so in September, middle of September. At the moment, we think that the epidemic is doubling roughly every seven days. It could be a little bit longer, maybe a little shorter, but let’s say roughly every seven days. If, and that’s quite a big if, but if that continues unabated and this grows, doubling every seven days, then what you see of course, let’s say that there were 5,000 today, it would be 10,000 next week, 20,000 the week after, 40,000 the week after. And you can see that by mid-October if that continued, you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day. 50,000 cases per day would be expected to lead a month later, so the middle of November say, to 200 plus deaths per day. So this graph, which is not a prediction, is simply showing you how quickly this can move if the doubling time stays at seven days. And of course the challenge therefore is to make sure the doubling time does not stay at seven days. There’re already things in place which are expected to slow that. And to make sure that we do not enter into this exponential growth and end up with the problems that you would predict as a result of that. That requires speed, it requires action and it requires enough in order to be able to bring that down. One final word on this section. So as we see it, cases are increasing, hospitalisations are following. Deaths unfortunately will follow that, and there is the potential for this to move very fast. A word on immunity. Next slide, please.

When people have an infection, the vast majority of people get an antibody response, and we know that some of those antibodies are so-called neutralising antibodies. They do indeed protect against the virus. We also know that they fade over time, and there are cases of people becoming re-infected. So this is not an absolute protection, and it will potentially decrease over time. What we see is that something under eight per cent of the population have been infected as we measure the antibodies, so about eight per cent, so 3 million or so people, may have been infected and have antibodies. It means that the vast majority of us are not protected in any way and are susceptible to this disease. There may be other forms of protection that increase that number a little bit, other parts of the immune system, but it does mean the vast majority of the population remain susceptible, and therefore you’d expect spread throughout them. The number of people with antibodies is a little higher in the cities, and it may be as high as 17 per cent or so in London. That may confer a little slowing of spread but not much more than that. At that point I’ll pass over to Chris to take you through some of the other features of the epidemic. Chris.

Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England:

Thanks, Patrick. Next slide, please.

What we have here are two maps, they are from England but there would be similar ones from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. What we have on the left here is a map where the darker colours are the rate of transmission, and on the right what we have is a map where orange or yellow or brown represent an increasing rate of transmission. The darker that colour, the greater the rate of increase, and green or blue represent a stable or falling situation. And what you can see in, on the left side is that at the moment the very high rates of transmission in the UK are highly concentrated in particular areas, but there are significant rates of transmission in many parts of the UK with the darker colours. But what we’ve seen is a progression where, after the remarkable efforts which got the rates right down across the country, firstly we saw very small outbreaks, might be associated with a workplace or another environment. Then we’ve seen more localised outbreaks which have got larger over time, particularly in the cities, and now what we’re seeing is a rate of increase across the great majority of the country. It’s growing at different rates but it is now increasing. And what we’ve found is that as the rate, as we go through in time, anywhere which was falling is now moving over to beginning to rise, and then the rate of rise continues in an upward direction. So this is not someone else’s problem, this is all of our problem. Next slide, please.

This graph is a simple one, it simply shows the number of inpatient cases in England over the period from the first of August. And until that point in time, there had been a steady fall over a long period of time, right back from early April. And it then stabilised for a period and flattened out, but over the period since the first of September, you can see a steady, sustained rise in numbers with a doubling time, as with the cases, of probably seven or eight days. Now what that tells us is that if this carried on unabated, these numbers are relatively small, we are talking about around 200 at the moment, but if this, if this continued along the path that Patrick laid out, the number of deaths directly from Covid, I’ll come back to indirect deaths, will continue to rise, potentially on an exponential curve. That means doubling and doubling and doubling again, and you can quickly move from really quite small numbers to really very large numbers because of that exponential process. So we have, in a bad sense, literally turned a corner, although only relatively recently. And we, I think everybody will realise that at this point the seasons are against us. We’re now going into the seasons late autumn and winter which benefit respiratory viruses, and it is very likely they will benefit Covid as they do for example flu. So we should see this as a six-month problem that we have to deal with collectively. It’s not indefinite and as I come on to, science will in due course come, ride to our rescue, but in this period of the next six months I think we have to realise we have to take this collectively, very seriously.

A lot of people have said maybe this is a milder virus than it was in April. I’m afraid, although that would be great if that were true, we see no evidence that is the case. At the moment, because the cases started to rise most in the lowest age bands, in young adults, not in children, children the rates have really not increased, as the data Patrick showed shows, showed in young children, but in young adults, these are the group who are least likely to end up in hospital. And a point we made right from the beginning is that for many people this remains a mild infection, but as you move up the ages, if you move into people who are more vulnerable, then the mortality rates, if people get this, rise to quite significant rates. And what we’ve seen in other countries, and are now clearly seeing here, is that they’re not staying just in the younger age groups, they’re moving up the age bands and the mortality rates will be similar to, slightly lower than they were previously, but they will be similar to what we saw previously. And these are significantly greater, for example, than ordinary seasonal flu. So seasonal flu normally in the UK would on average a year would kill around 7,000 people a year tragically, and in a bad flu year, as there was for example about three years ago, it might kill upward of 20,000 a year. This virus is more virulent than flu. So the numbers people talk about are not unreasonable numbers for us to be thinking about. Treatment is better, there is no doubt about that. Doctors, nurses have learned to treat this much more effectively and we have new drugs such as dexamethasone. These will reduce the mortality rate, but they will definitely not eliminate or take it right down to trivial levels.

Two other broad points I wanted to make. The first one is that there are, as we’ve said from the beginning, and it really does need to be repeated, four ways in which this virus is going to have a very potential significant effect on the population’s health if we let it grow out of control. The first, the easiest to, to identify, is direct Covid deaths. People who get the virus and die of the virus. The second would be if the NHS emergency services were overwhelmed by a huge spike, and that is what the extraordinary efforts of the population allowed to prevent happening in the first wave we met. The third however is very important, and I think its importance should not be understated, which is if the NHS is having to spend a large proportion of its effort in trying to treat Covid cases because the numbers have gone up very, to a very high levels and trying to put in case, in place, large numbers of systems to try and reduce the risk of transmission in hospitals, it will lead to a reduction in treatment for other areas, in early diagnosis of disease, and in prevention programmes. And so there is an indirect effect on deaths and on illness from this impact on the NHS if we allow the numbers to rise too fast. But on the other side, we also know that some of the things we’ve had to do are going to cause significant problems in the economy, big social impacts, impacts on mental health, and therefore ministers making decisions, and all of society, have to walk this very difficult balance. If we do too little, this virus will go out of control and we will get significant numbers of increased direct and indirect deaths, but if we go too far the other way, then we can cause damage to the economy which can feed through to unemployment, to poverty and to deprivation, all of which have long-term health effects. So we need always to keep these two sides in mind.

My final point is that if I increase my risk, a lot of people say, well, can’t people just be allowed to take their own risk? The problem with a pandemic or an epidemic infection like this is if I as an individual increase my risk, I increase the risk to everyone around me and then everyone who’s a contact of theirs, and sooner or later the chain will meet people who are vulnerable or elderly or have a long term problem from Covid. So you cannot in an epidemic just take your own risk. Unfortunately, you’re taking a risk on behalf of everybody else.

It’s important that we see this as something we have to do collectively, and there are broadly four things we can do, over the next period, to get on top of this. The first of which is reducing our individual risk, and this is around the things that we all know about, hands, face, space, washing hands, using masks, particularly in environments which are enclosed, public transport and so on, and also, in particular, having space between people whenever we can achieve it. Especially when indoors. The second group of things are things we can do to isolate the virus. So if people have symptoms they must self-isolate and we must find their contacts so that they can isolate, and in people who’ve travelled from high risk areas, they also should isolate, and this means that they are taking on behalf of society a big step forward to keep the virus out of circulation whilst they are still infectious. This is an absolutely critical part of the response. The third one, and in many ways the most difficult, is that we have to break unnecessary links between households, because that is the way in which this virus is transmitted, and this means reducing social contacts, whether they are at work, and this is where we have enormous gratitude to all the businesses, for example, who’ve worked so hard to make their environment Covid-secure to reduce the risk, and also in social environments. And we have to try and do this in the least damaging way, but we, we all know we cannot do this without some significant downsides, and this is, this is a balance of risk between if we don’t do enough the virus will take off, and we at the moment, that is the path that we are clearly on, and we, if we do not change course, then we’re going to find ourselves in a very difficult problem, as Patrick has laid out. The final thing we can do is the science, is investing in drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and Patrick is going to take us through the final section, where we’ve got to with the most exciting of these, which is vaccines.

Sir Patrick Vallance, Government Chief Scientific Adviser:

Thank you very much. As Chris has said, we will be living with this vac, this virus. This is now circulating amongst the population worldwide, it will continue to do so. We will be learning how to live with it. One important part of that is vaccines. I’m pleased to say that there is good progress that’s being made. Many vaccines now have shown they generate an immune response of a type that ought to be protective, and several vaccines are in very late stage clinical testing, aiming to show that they are both effective and safe. The UK, through the Vaccines Task Force, has got access to a number of these, as illustrated on this slide, with a range of different vaccine technologies from a number of different companies. The UK therefore has put itself in a good position in terms of vaccine supply, and the possibility that one of these will work. We don’t yet know that they will work, but there is increasing evidence that it’s pointed in the right direction, and it’s possible that some vaccine could be available before the end of the year in small amounts, for certain groups, much more likely that we’ll see vaccines becoming available over the first half of next year. Again, not certain but pointed in the right direction, which then of course gives the possibility of a different approach to this virus, but in the meantime, we’ve got to get on control, control of this in the way that Chris has described in order to make sure we can live with it in a way that is sustainable and protects health and society overall. Thank you very much.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, Department of Health and Social Care, and Sir Patrick Vallance",2020-09-21,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chief-scientific-advisor-and-chief-medical-officer-briefing-on-coronavirus-covid-19-21-september-2020--2"
"16","Speech","Foreign Secretary's visit to India: joint press conference opening statement, 15 December 2020","In Delhi with India’s Minister of External Affairs Dr Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Dominic Raab spoke about our shared plans for a closer UK-India relationship.","Good afternoon, thank you all for joining us and thank you Minister Jaishankar for your very warm welcome here in Delhi.

Can I just start by saying what huge admiration I have for this country. You are the world’s largest democracy. The country with one of the highest number of scientists and engineers, a leader in tech, a leader in solar and wind energy, and a huge presence on the global stage.

So it’s a great pleasure to be here with Dr Jaishankar and to discuss our shared plans for an even closer future relationship.

We agreed on the key elements of a 10-year UK-India roadmap so that we can deliver a step change in ambition for the relationship between our two countries. We look forward to taking this forward in 2021 – including through the UK’s Presidency of the G7 and also our Presidency of the UN Climate Change Conference, and as we see and welcome India return to the UN Security Council.

It is very much with that in mind I am pleased that Prime Minister Johnson has invited Prime Minister Modi to join the UK-hosted the G7 Summit next year. Prime Minister Johnson has also gratefully accepted the very generous invitation to attend India’s Republic Day celebration in January which is a great honour.

I think we share the belief that we can do even more together on our shared priorities in the months and years ahead. For the UK, we see those priorities along the following lines.

First of all, we want to deepen our economic partnership. We already have a strong and growing trade relationship. In the year before the pandemic hit, bilateral trade between India and the UK grew at a vibrant 11%. Our investment relations supports over half-a-million jobs in each other’s economies – including many UK jobs in tech and telecoms.

Now what we want to do is take that up to another level working towards agreeing an enhanced trade partnership next year – which itself we hope will be a stepping stone towards a future Free Trade Agreement. I think that could unlock huge opportunities for British and Indian businesses, lowering barriers in areas like food and drink, healthcare and life sciences, IT, data, chemicals and financial services. I think there are some exciting possibilities ahead.

Second, we are committed to building a stronger defence and security partnership with our Indian friends. That will help us to tackle shared issues of concern such as terrorism and maritime security – including piracy in the Western Indian Ocean.

It will also help us respond to the new and emerging challenges like space and cybersecurity. We want to work together to ensure our telecoms networks, our 5G networks, are more secure and resilient.

Third, climate change. Prime Minister Modi has been very clear this is a real priority for India. We recognise India’s global leadership in this area, through the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.

As hosts of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow next year, we will also be playing a leading role ourselves. We want to see an ambitious outcome which really helps to shift the dial on climate change. India has made real strides on renewable energy. We want to keep building on our partnership internationally in this area.

Finally, I should also mention we want to deepen our partnerships in education, research and innovation. Our countries are both leaders in these fields. It is an area of complementarity, but also comparative advantage and I think there is a huge scope for further collaboration together in a collaborative international setting.

In the UK we give a warm welcome to thousands of Indian students and academics in the UK each year. They make an incredible contribution to our country and we feel they are very valued guests and we prize the contribution they make.

Perhaps the proudest example of our partnership today is on COVID-19. Oxford University, AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute India have been working closely together. And the Institute is now planning to produce one billion doses of the Oxford vaccine by the end of next year, many of which will be destined for low and middle income countries.

That is the UK and India working together to transform people’s lives around the world. We want to take advantage of these vaccines, not only for our own people but to make sure the most vulnerable and poorest countries around the world get equitable distribution and access.

In these areas, and many others, our partnership can be a force for good in the world at large. That’s why a closer relationship with India, and the wider Indo-Pacific region, is really one of the very highest policy priorities for the UK government.

Thank you.","Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP",2020-12-15,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-during-visit-to-india-tuesday-15-december"
"17","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 October 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement at the coronavirus press conference.","Good afternoon, I am joined this afternoon by Dr Susan Hopkins of NHS Test and Trace and Public Health England and Sir Patrick Vallance Chief Scientific Advisor.

On Monday, I explained that we would seek to consult with mayors and local authorities in areas moving into the Very High alert level.

I am grateful to all those in local government in hotspot areas who have been working with us over the last week on how to control the virus in their areas.

In particular, I would like to thank Steve Rotheram in Merseyside, Sadiq Khan in London and local leaders in Lancashire who have worked constructively with us.

In Merseyside, where the situation is most acute, we were able to conclude talks quickly. In London, we have worked with the Mayor to respond to rising infections across the capital as well as particular spikes in some boroughs. And in Lancashire today, we have worked with both Labour and Conservative leaders to agree a package.

These were tough discussions, difficult decisions. No one wants to have to implement these measures which damage local businesses, curtail individual freedom and impose significant strains on people’s mental health.

But these decisions were necessary because of the rate of increase not just of infections but also in hospitalisations and admissions to intensive care. Without action, there is no doubt that our NHS would soon be struggling to treat the sheer number of people seriously ill with Covid. Non-Covid treatments and surgeries would need to be cancelled in order to cope. And many more people would die.

So taking action is the right and responsible thing to do. And it is backed up by significant support for areas on Very High alert:


    The Job Support Scheme, combined with Universal Credit, means that those on low incomes who are affected by business closures will receive at least 80% of their wages.
  
  
    We are providing up to £465 million to help Very High alert level areas to implement and enforce the restrictions, in addition to the £1 billion of extra funding for local authorities across the country.
  
  
    We will work with local authorities to allocate testing and introduce local contact tracing.
  
Now, we have not yet reached an agreement with Greater Manchester. I completely understand the reluctance of the Mayor and his colleagues to take Manchester into the Very High alert level. It is far from a pain-free course of action and it will mean a difficult time for the people of that great part of the country – on top of the restrictions they have already had to endure since the summer.

But I must stress, the situation in Greater Manchester is grave, and it worsens with each passing day.

Cases doubled in the last 9 days. High infection rates are creeping up the age range: while cases are 690 per 100,000 for 16-29 year olds, they have now risen to 224 per 100,000 for the over-60s.

The number of COVID in-patients in Manchester’s ICU beds is already over 40% of the number at the height of the first wave. That number will inevitably rise further, given that hospitalisation occurs 2-3 weeks after infection. On present trends, in just over 2 weeks there will be more Covid patients in intensive care than at the peak of the first wave.

So I urge the Mayor to reconsider and engage constructively. I cannot stress enough – time is of the essence. Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care, and tragically more people will die.

Of course if agreement cannot be reached, I will need to intervene in order to protect Manchester’s hospitals and to save the lives of Manchester’s residents.

But our efforts will be so much more effective if we work together.

Some have argued that we should introduce a national lockdown instead of targeted local action and I disagree. Closing businesses in Cornwall, where transmission is low, will not cut transmission in Manchester.

So while I cannot rule anything out, if at all possible I want to avoid another national lockdown, with the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have.

Alongside our local strategy we have been working throughout to find other ways to suppress this virus.

We are backing our brilliant scientists leading the global effort to find a safe and effective vaccine. We have also secured early access to over 350 million vaccine doses through a portfolio of promising new vaccines to ensure we are in the best place, and we are taking every possible step to ensure we can move as quickly as possible to deploy a vaccine if and when one is found to work.

And we’ve created a huge diagnostics industry from scratch, scaling up the ability to test from 2,000 in February to more than 300,000 today.

I also want to update on our future approach to testing.

We are now testing more people than any other country in Europe but we always want to go further.

One of the most dangerous aspects of this disease is that people without any symptoms can infect many others without realising it. If we can catch more asymptomatic people before they unknowingly pass on the disease to the vulnerable, we can help to stop the virus’ vicious spread.

So far it has been difficult to do this. But that is changing.

Scientists and companies in Britain and around the world have been developing new tests which are faster, simpler and cheaper. They have been working hard to discover and evaluate new testing technologies. Though there is work to do, It’s becoming clear over the past few weeks that some of these new tests are highly effective and can help us save lives and jobs over winter.

We have already bought millions of these tests, some of which are very simple – meaning you simply need to wipe the swab inside your mouth – and can give a result as quickly as in 15 minutes. Some of these fast tests work with saliva and we are already using these in hospitals.

We have started building the infrastructure for domestic manufacture of these tests, ensuring that Britain has the ability to produce millions of fast tests here.

Over the next few weeks we will start distributing and trialling these tests across the country. This will enable us to do quick turnaround tests on NHS and care home staff much more frequently. By testing more frequently and quickly than ever before, we can hope we can help prevent the virus entering and spreading through care homes.

And we will be able to test students in universities with outbreaks, as well as children in schools, helping us to keep education open safely through the winter.

And we will make tests available to local directors of public health to help control localised outbreaks - handing more control from London to all parts of our country so that those on the ground can use the tools we give them as they think best. And I have instructed my team to ensure that Liverpool City Region, Lancashire, and any other areas which enter into the Very High alert level are immediately prioritised for those tests.

This will make a big difference in how we protect people from this disease. But it’s vital that we all take a cautious approach to this new technology.

First, it will take time to develop this plan. No country in the world is regularly testing millions of people, so we need to take the time to establish how to do this effectively and safely, and to build the logistics and distribution operation necessary for a large-scale operation across the country.

Second, we won’t be able to use testing to get business back to normal quickly. In time, we want to use tests to open, and keep open, more parts of the economy that have sadly been closed. But it is crucial that we make sure such systems work safely and I must level with you that it will take time to get this right before many organisations can buy and operate these tests themselves.

Third, this will need a huge effort across the country, and we will need hospitals, care homes schools, universities and other organisations to work with us as we develop this plan.

But the most important thing is that people isolate if they test positive. If you test positive with one of these fast new tests, then you must stay at home.

If everyone follows the rule and self-isolates if you have symptoms, get a positive test, or have come into contact with someone who has the virus, we will suppress the disease.

And we must all remember that this virus thrives on human contact. So we must do everything in our power to limit its spread. Always think: Hands Face Space, ventilate your buildings, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, keep your distance from others. And make sure - as I say - you improve ventilation when spending time indoors. If we all do these simple things we’ll protect each other from the virus and we will defeat it together.

I’ll hand over to Patrick Valance who will run through the latest data and we’ll then go to your questions. Sir Patrick.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-10-16,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-october-2020"
"18","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 November 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement at the coronavirus press conference.","PM statement on coronavirus 9 November 2020

Across the country and around the world this evening,

people are asking one question about our fight against Covid,

does the news of progress towards a vaccine – that’s been announced today - mean we are at the beginning of the end of our troubles?

So, let me set out our assessment.

The Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine has been tested on over 40,000 volunteers and interim results suggest it is proving 90 per cent effective at protecting people against the virus.

But we haven’t yet seen the full safety data,

and these findings also need to be peer-reviewed.

So we have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go before we know the vaccine can be used.

What I can say is that if and when this vaccine is approved, we, in this country, will be ready to start using it.

Earlier this year the UK Government ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine – enough for about a third of the population, since you need two doses each.

That puts us towards the front of the international pack on a per capita basis – and I should add we’ve ordered over 300 million doses from 5 other vaccine candidates as well.

If the Pfizer vaccine passes all the rigorous safety checks and is proved to be effective then we will begin a UK-wide NHS led programme of vaccine distribution.

We will decide the order in which people are offered the vaccination taking account of recommendations from a group of scientific experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

They’re looking at a range of factors, including the different characteristics of different types of vaccines, to work out the most effective way to protect as many people as possible and save as many lives as we can.

And we will be setting out more detail about that in due course.

But – and you know I am going to say this -

I must stress, these are very, very early days.

We have talked for a long time, or I have, about the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hill

And tonight that toot of the bugle is louder.

But it is still some way off.

And we absolutely cannot rely on this as a solution.

The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at such a critical moment.

On Friday, SAGE reported that the R is above 1 in England – though this does not take into account the current national restrictions.

Alas, the death figures are tragically rising, running at an average of over 300 a day – sadly double where they were 24 days ago

The number of Covid patients in hospital has risen from just over 10,000 two weeks ago to nearly 13,000 on 5 November,

and we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak.

Irrespective of whether there is a vaccine on the way or not

we must continue to do everything possible right now to bring the R down.

And that is why we hope and believe that mass testing will help.

Our first pilot began in Liverpool on Friday, in partnership with Liverpool City Council.

We’ve tested thousands of people there but there are still a lot more to do, so please if you are in Liverpool, get yourself along to a testing centre – there are 19 at the moment with more still to come.

The more people get tested the better we can protect that great city, and drive the disease down in Liverpool

so do it for your friends, for your relatives, for your community.

And I want to thank the fantastic support of the army, the people of Liverpool and Liverpool City Council.

And we are now going further by sending out hundreds of thousands of rapid lateral flow tests to local authorities right across England - and also of course to the Devolved Administrations.

We’re also working with universities to establish, as soon as possible, similar mass testing capacity for students up and down the country.

But while we are making progress this project is still in its infancy.

And neither mass testing nor progress on vaccines –both vital arrows in our epidemiological quiver, both key parts of our fight against Covid - are at the present time a substitute for the national restrictions, for social distancing, for hand hygiene and all the rest.

So it is all the more important to follow the rules.

I know it’s been a tough first weekend of these Autumn restrictions

and I’m especially grateful to the Royal British Legion and all those who worked so hard to ensure that no virus would stop us yesterday from honouring the memory of those who gave their lives for our freedom.

But we must get through this to 2nd December, when these measures expire and we plan to move forward with a tiered approach.

Remember the basics, hands, face, space,

and the follow the rules,

that is how we can together protect our NHS, save lives and get this virus back in its box.

And that is what we will do.

So thank you.

Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street coronavirus briefing.

I’m joined today by Professor Steve Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England, and General Sir Gordon Messenger, the Head of Operations for the Community Testing Programme.

Tomorrow night, our national restrictions in England will come to an end and, subject to the vote in Parliament, we’ll return to the tiered system from Wednesday morning.

I know that the national restrictions have been really tough for some people. But the good news is: they’ve been working.

Let me take a moment if I may to run through the numbers.

Today’s study from Imperial College shows that the national restrictions have brought down cases down by a third.

Over the last week, the average number of positive tests is now 14,778 – down from a peak of 25,331 on 16 November.

Today, there are 15,712 patients in hospital in the UK with coronavirus – that is down from 16,612 on 23 November a week ago.

In England, in the week before the peak, the number of cases grew by 11% but in the last week, cases have dropped by 30%, almost a third.

This is clearly good news – it shows the national restrictions have been successful.

And what this means in practice is that – through everyone’s actions in respecting the national lockdown and through everything people have sacrificed – we’ve reduced pressures on the NHS, we’ve brought down the number of coronavirus cases, we’ve got this virus back under control.

And I want to thank you for that and for the part that you’ve played.

The effect of the action we take, of course, brings with it huge challenges too – especially for the hospitality sector.

But as the analysis of health, economic and social effects of COVID-19 and the approach to tiering shows – which we’ve published today – it clearly demonstrates, this action is necessary to avoid a much worse outcome.

And we must be vigilant. There are still 14,778 positive cases reported every day. There are still those 15,712 people in hospital with COVID.

And, sadly, there are still 460 reported deaths, on average, each day. This is far too many.

But there is light at the end of the tunnel. We know that, together, we can beat this – and we’ve got to stick at it.

Putting this in technical terms, the R rate is back below 1 – but only just.

When R is below 1, the number of infections falls over time, because on average, each infected person infects fewer than one other.

And for that to happen on average, it’s important that lots of infected people, infect no one else at all.

This is the central challenge of this pandemic and it’s made much much more difficult because about 1 in 3 people who have coronavirus have no symptoms at all, but nevertheless pass the infection on to others.

And that’s why, even as we ease these national restrictions, we’ve got to keep some restrictions in place. Hence the tiering system.

So while we can let up a little, we can’t afford to let up a lot.

The success of our collective efforts means that, from Wednesday, everyone in England – even those in Tier 3 – can have some greater freedoms.

But we don’t have much headroom. We can’t risk letting cases rise again – especially into Christmas and with the flu season around the corner.

The Prime Minister has published the government’s COVID-19 Winter Plan which sets out the end to national restrictions and the steps we’ll take to help bring life back to normal by spring.

But even as we take these steps forward, we must keep our resolve. We’ve worked so hard and collectively sacrificed so much. But we can get through this. And we know that hope is on the horizon.

In the past fortnight we have made some really significant progress on vaccines and the NHS now stands ready to deploy a vaccine, should one be approved by the UK’s independent regulator.

And today, Moderna, the American company, formally filed for the use of its vaccine in America. Moderna has already been submitting data to the MHRA, the UK’s regulator, for some time.

And as we set out this weekend, we have secured 2 million further doses, meaning that we in the UK now have access to a total of 357 million doses of 7 different vaccines.

And while we keep working on a vaccine, we have already built a huge testing capacity that we can deploy right now.

I wanted to take a moment to talk through the next steps on testing.

Since the start of the pandemic we’ve built the biggest testing capacity in Europe and it means we can use tests to do lots of things we couldn’t do before.

In addition to our symptomatic testing programme and the rapid testing we are now deploying in the NHS and across social care, we have the capacity to do more.

Today we begin the roll-out of our university student testing programme and expand community testing.

And we won’t just test people with symptoms; because of this problem of asymptomatic transmission, people who don’t have symptoms but do have covid transmitting covid to others we’re going to test people who don’t have symptoms as well.

This really matters, because by finding the positives, we can break the chain of transmission and stop other people catching covid.

In Liverpool, where over 300,000 people – both with symptoms and without – where that testing has happened, they’ve managed to bring the case rates down by over three-quarters.

And so on Wednesday Liverpool will go into Tier 2, not Tier 3.

Of course, I want to see this sort of success right across the board so we’re rolling out community testing much more widely.

We’ve been working with those areas going into Tier 3 with colleagues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland too.

And today – with the publication of our community testing prospectus – we set out the next phase of that work to give Tier 3 areas a faster way out of the toughest restrictions, to support them to come down the tiers – as has happened in Liverpool.

We’ve already received significant interest from around the country, including from the West Midlands, Redcar, Warwickshire and Medway and others.

And this offer is available across all of the UK and will be delivered in partnership with local authorities in Tier 3 areas and devolved administrations throughout the country.

Because by using tests that can turn results around in under 30 minutes we can identify and isolate people who have covid, including, crucially, the 1 in 3 people with covid, who don’t have any symptoms at all – but can nevertheless pass the infection on.

Because you can have covid without symptoms and still infect others. That of course is a silent danger.

You wouldn’t know that you’re risking lives around you.

So, if you’re offered a test – please take it. You might just save a life.

The final thing I wanted to say is that it is all of our responsibility to keep ourselves safe, to keep our families, our friends and our communities safe. That responsibility is on all of us.

I know it weighs heavily – we’ve been carrying it for a long time now.

But the light of dawn is on the horizon.

It’s the moment to stand firm until the morning.

So we can look back and see clearly: that everything we gave and everything we did, it was not for nothing but so we could save lives and build back better for everyone.

I now want to turn to Professor Powis to take us through the latest numbers on the impact on the NHS.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-12-01,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-30-november-2020"
"20","Speech","Renewing regional coronavirus restrictions in England","The Health and Social Care Secretary spoke to the House of Commons about the coronavirus situation and returning to strenghtened local COVID restriction tiers.","Mr Speaker, with permission I’d like to make a statement on coronavirus.

We are approaching the end of a year where we have asked so much of the British people.

And in response to this unprecedented threat to lives and to livelihoods, the British people have well and truly risen to the challenge by coming together to slow the spread and support each other.

I know how difficult this has been, especially for those areas that have been in restrictions for so long. The national measures have successfully turned the curve, and begun to ease the pressure on the NHS.

Cases are down by 19% from a week ago and daily hospital admissions have fallen 7% in the last week.

January and February are always difficult months for the NHS. So it is vital we safeguard the gains we’ve made.

We must protect our NHS this winter. We have invested in expanded capacity – not just the Nightingales, but in hospitals across the land – and we have welcomed thousands of new staff.

Mr Speaker, this morning’s figures show the number of nurses in the NHS is up 14,800 compared to just a year ago – well on our way to delivering our manifesto commitment of 50,000 more nurses.

Together, while we invest in our NHS, we must also protect our NHS. So it will always be there for all of us, during this pandemic and beyond.

New measures

Mr Speaker, I am so grateful for the resolve that people have shown throughout this crisis.

Thanks to this shared sacrifice, we have been able to announce that we will not be renewing our national restrictions in England.

And we have been able to announce UK-wide arrangements for Christmas, allowing friends and loved ones to reunite, and form a 5-day Christmas bubble. And I know that this news will provide hope for so many.

But we must remain vigilant. There are still, today, 16,570 people in hospital with coronavirus across the UK, and 696 deaths were reported yesterday.

That means 696 more families mourning the loss of a loved one, and the House mourns with them. So, as tempting as it may be, we cannot simply flick a switch and try to return life straight back to normal.

Because if we did this, we would undo the hard work of so many and see the NHS overwhelmed, with all that that would entail.

We must keep suppressing the virus, while supporting education, the economy and of course the NHS, until a vaccine can make us safe. That is our plan.

We will do this by returning to a tiered approach, applying the toughest measures to the parts of the country where cases and pressure on the NHS are highest, and allowing greater freedom in areas where prevalence is lower.

While the strategy remains the same, the current epidemiological evidence, and clinical advice, shows we must make the tiers tougher than they were before to protect the NHS through the winter and avert another national lockdown.

So we’ve looked at each of the tiers afresh and strengthened them, as the Prime Minister set out on Monday.

In tier 1 if you can work from home, you should do so.

In tier 2, alcohol may only now be served in hospitality settings as part of a substantial meal.

And in tier 3, indoor entertainment, hotels and other accommodation will have to close, along with all forms of hospitality, except for delivery and takeaways.

Allocation of tiers

Mr Speaker, I know that people want certainty about the rules they need to follow in their area.

These decisions are not easy. But they are necessary.

We have listened to local experts, and been guided by the best public health advice, including from the Joint Biosecurity Centre.

We set out the criteria in the COVID-19 Winter Plan, and we published the data on which the decisions are made.

As the Winter Plan sets out, the 5 indicators are:

the case rates in all age groups
  in particular, cases among the over 60s
  the rate at which cases are rising or falling
  the positivity rate
  and the pressures on the local NHS
When setting the boundaries for these tiers, we have looked not just at geographical areas but the human geographies which influence how the virus spreads, like travel patterns and the epidemiological situation in neighbouring areas.

While all 3 tiers are less stringent than the national lockdown that we are all living in now, to keep people safe, and to keep the gains being made, more areas than before will be in the top two tiers.

This is necessary to protect our NHS and keep the virus under control.

Turning to the tiers specifically: the lowest case rates are in Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly, which will go into tier 1.

In all 3 areas have had very low case rates throughout and I want to thank residents for being so vigilant during the whole pandemic.

I know that many other areas would want to be in tier 1. I understand that.

My own constituency of West Suffolk has the lowest case rate for over 60s in the whole country.

And I want to thank Matthew Hicks and John Griffiths, the leaders of Suffolk and West Suffolk Councils, and their teams, for this achievement.

But despite this, and despite the fact Suffolk overall has the lowest case rate outside Cornwall and the Isle of Wight, our judgement, looking at all of the indicators, and based on the public health advice, is that Suffolk needs to be in tier 2 to get the virus further under control.

Now I hope that Suffolk, and so many other parts of the country, can get to tier 1 soon, and the more people stick to the rules, the quicker that will happen.

We must make the right judgements guided by the science.

The majority of England will be in tier 2, but in a significant number of areas, I’m afraid, they need to be in tier 3 to bring case rates down.

I know how tough this is, both for areas that have been in restrictions for a long time, like Leicester and Greater Manchester, and also for areas where cases have risen sharply recently, like Bristol, the West Midlands and Kent.

The full allocations have been published this morning and laid as a written ministerial statement just before this statement began.

I understand the impact that these measures will have, but they are necessary given the scale of the threat that we face.

We will review the measures in a fortnight, and keep them regularly under review after that.

I want to thank everybody who’s in the tier 3 areas for the sacrifices that they are making, not just to protect themselves and their families, but their whole community.

And regardless of your tier, I ask everyone: we must all think of our own responsibilities to keep this virus under control.

We should see these restrictions not as a boundary to push but as a limit on what the public health advice says we can do safely in any area.

But, frankly, the less any one person passes on the disease, the faster we will can get this disease under control together. And that is on all of us.

Testing

Mr Speaker, we must all play our part while we work so hard to deliver the new technologies that will help us get out of this. In particular, vaccines and testing.

The past fortnight has been illuminated by news of encouraging clinical trials for vaccines. First, from Pfizer/BioNTech and then from Moderna. And then of course earlier this week, from the Oxford/AstraZeneca team.

If these vaccines are approved, the NHS stands ready to roll them out, as soon as safely possible. Alongside vaccines, we have made huge strides in the deployment of testing.

Our roll-out of community testing has been successful because it means we can identify more people who have the virus but don’t have symptoms and help them to isolate, breaking the connections that the virus needs to spread.

As part of our COVID-19 Winter Plan, we will use these tests on a regular basis. For instance, to allow visitors safely to see loved ones in care homes, to protect our frontline NHS and social care colleagues, and to allow vital industries and public services to keep running safely.

Mr Speaker, we have seen in Liverpool, where now over 300,000 people have been tested, how successful this community testing can be, and I want to pay tribute to the people of Liverpool, both for following the restrictions and for embracing this community testing.

It has been a big team effort across the whole city. And the result is that in the Liverpool City Region the number of cases has fallen by more than two-thirds.

In the borough of Liverpool itself, where the mass testing took place, cases have fallen by three-quarters.

It hasn’t been easy and, sadly, many people in Liverpool have lost their lives to COVID. But thanks to people sticking to the rules, and to the huge effort of community testing, Liverpool’s cases are now low enough for the whole City Region to go into tier 2.

This shows what we can do when we work together. We can beat the virus.

And I want to pay tribute to the people of Liverpool, to NHS Test and Trace, the University, the Hospital Trust, and Mayor Joe Anderson and so many others, who have demonstrated such impressive leadership, responsibility, and a true sense of public service.

We are now expanding this community testing programme even further, to launch a major community testing programme, honing in on the areas with the greatest rate of infection.

This programme is open to all local authorities in tier 3 areas in the first instance and offers help to get out of the toughest restrictions as fast as possible.

We will work with local authorities on a plan to get tests where they’re needed most and how we can get as many people as possible to come forward and get certainty about their condition.

The more people who get tested then the quicker that a local area can move down through the tiers, and get life closer to normal.

Conclusion

Mr Speaker, viruses can take a short time to spread, but a long time to vanquish, and sadly there is no quick fix.

They call upon all our determination to make the sacrifices that will bring it to heel and all our ingenuity to make the scientific advances that will get us through.

Hope is on the horizon but we still have further to go. So we must all dig deep. The end is in sight. We mustn’t give up now.

We must follow these new rules and make sure that our actions today will save lives in future and help get our country through this.

And I commend this statement to the House.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-11-26,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/renewing-regional-coronavirus-restrictions-in-england"
"21","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 12 March 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement on coronavirus.","Good afternoon everybody and thank you very much for coming.

I’ve just chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee including ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

And it’s clear that coronavirus, COVID-19, continues and will continue to spread across the world and our country over the next few months. We’ve done what can be done to contain this disease and this has bought us valuable time.

But it is now a global pandemic.

And the number of cases will rise sharply and indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests.

I’ve got to be clear, we’ve all got to be clear, that this is the worst public health crisis for a generation.

Some people compare it to seasonal flu. Alas, that is not right. Owing to the lack of immunity, this disease is more dangerous.

And it’s going to spread further and I must level with you, level with the British public, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. And the Chief Scientific Adviser will set out the best information we have on that in a moment.

But as we’ve said over the last few weeks, we have a clear plan that we are now working through.

And we are now moving to the next phase in that plan.

Because this is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we’ll have more time for medical research.

We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope.

The Chief Medical Officer will set out our lines of defence. We have to deploy these at the right time to maximise their effect. The most important task will be to protect our elderly and most vulnerable people during the peak weeks when there is the maximum risk of exposure to the disease and when the NHS will be under the most pressure. So the most dangerous period is not now but some weeks away depending on how fast it spreads.

Today therefore we are moving forward with our plan. From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild – either a new continuous cough or a high temperature – then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease.

We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips.

At some point in the next few weeks, we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms, we will be asking everyone in the household to stay at home. We are not introducing this yet for reasons Sir Patrick will explain, but I want to signal now that this is coming down the track.

We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. The scientific advice as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread.

But there is also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. So we’re discussing these issues with colleagues in all parts of the United Kingdom and will have more to say shortly about the timing of further action in that respect.

At all stages, we have been guided by the science, and we will do the right thing at the right time.

We are not - repeat not - closing schools now. The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good at this time. But we are of course keeping this under review and this again may change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so. And that remains our advice.

There is no escaping the reality that these measures will cause severe disruption across our country for many months.

The best scientific advice is that this will help us slow the disease and save lives. There will be detailed information available on the NHS website and from 111 online. But I want to stress something that is very important in the wake of what we’re saying this afternoon – I urge people, who think in view of what we’re saying about their potential symptoms that they should stay at home, not to call 111 but to use the internet for information if they can.

I also want at this stage to speak directly to older people. Because this disease is particularly dangerous for you, for older people, even though the vast majority this will be a mild to moderate illness, I know that many people will be very worried. And I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives, the more vulnerable members of their family, our neighbours, and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months. We’re going to need to mobilise millions of people to help and support each other. And I just want to you to know that the government will do all we can to help you and your family during this period. We’re not just going to be as you saw yesterday supporting the economy during this period, we will be providing money and many other forms of support, and helping communities to support each other.

And as we have done over the last few weeks, we will continue to provide, as soon as we have it, as much clear scientific and medical information as we can.

So I’d like to end by repeating the two important messages, with which you will have become familiar – it is still vital, perhaps more vital than ever – that we remember to wash our hands.

And lastly of course even if things seem tough now, just to remember, that we will get through this, this country will get through this epidemic, just as it has got through many tougher experiences before if we look out for each other and commit wholeheartedly to a full national effort.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-03-12,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-12-march-2020"

Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street coronavirus briefing.

I’m joined today by Professor Jonathan Van Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Office and Dr Susan Hopkins, the Chief Medical Advisor to NHS Test and Trace.

Before we talk about testing and vaccines, I’d like to update you on the latest coronavirus data.

The average number of new cases each day is now 25,329 up from 22,443 last week.

There are today 14,915 COVID-19 patients in hospital across the UK, compared to 13,025 a week ago.

And, sadly, yesterday 168 deaths were reported.

This means that in the last week we’ve seen an average of 413 deaths, up from 332 a day a week ago.

My profound sympathies are with everyone who’ve lost a loved one throughout this pandemic. These numbers make painfully clear, this virus remains a potent threat. And that threat is not just to the oldest and most vulnerable but to anyone, of any age, and of any background.

We have already seen the serious impact that long COVID can have on peoples’ quality of life, even the fit and the young. Symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness, muscle pain, and neurological problems long after they first had the virus.

We know that long COVID affects thousands of people, many thousands of people. We have already opened long COVID clinics in many parts of the country. And I am very pleased to be able to confirm that the NHS will have a network of 40 long COVID clinics right across England in place by the end of the month.

They will bring together doctors, nurses, therapists and other NHS staff like physios to help those suffering with the long-term effects of coronavirus. Long COVID shows that this virus can strike us all, and we must all do our bit to strike back by following the rules and denying the virus the connections that it needs to spread.

I know that this has not been easy and that it has meant celebrating Diwali or commemorating the fallen in ways that have been different this year from what we might normally do.

I want to say thank you to everyone for their patience. We must persevere and get this virus under control. Coronavirus is not a short term problem that can easily be fixed. We must focus on the long term solutions, underpinned by the best possible science that can see us through this crisis and also lay firm foundations for the future.

Testing capacity

This includes our ability to test at scale. We’re constantly improving our response, to bring the confidence that high-quality testing can provide. We’ve already built the largest coronavirus testing capacity in Europe.

Up from 2,000 tests a day in March, to our current capacity of more than half a million. But we will not rest, because testing capacity helps keep people safe and can help us get things back more like normal life.

Today I am delighted that we can announce two new mega labs, which will open early in the new year. They will add another 600,000 capacity to our daily capacity, that doubles the current capacity. They will also create 4,000 jobs. Crucially, they will represent a permanent part of the UK’s new diagnostics industry.

We didn’t enter this crisis with a major diagnostics industry, and so together we have built one. Both to help beat the virus by testing more people and returning results more quickly and to give our country a permanent defence that we need for any future epidemic.

And to improve our care for so many other diseases, like heart disease or cancer or flu.

I am absolutely determined that we must have a massive diagnostics capacity, not just for this pandemic, but long into the future.

More capacity also speeds up turnaround times but speeding up turnaround times isn’t just about the test, it is also about the logistics.

So I want to take one moment to thank the Royal Mail, who, from this weekend, will empty some of their post boxes 7 days a week to speed up home testing. It is a big team effort and I am very grateful for our posties for playing their part to help keep people safe.

This expansion of testing matters because it helps protect people. I just want to touch on some of the reasons why it matters.

It means we can test the most vulnerable, and those who care for the most vulnerable, and we can test them more frequently.

Over the last week, for instance we have delivered more than 3 million tests to NHS staff, to begin their regular bi-weekly testing.

And today I know so many people have been relieved to hear that we have started a pilot for testing visitors in care homes, to use tests to allow people to visit loved ones in care homes in a way that keeps them safe and bring back some of those magical moments of social contact.

Our expansion of testing also means we can roll out mass testing further.

We are making progress in the city wide testing across Liverpool and we are now rolling out this localised approach to other areas.

83 local authorities have now signed up to receive regular batches of these new lateral flow tests, which can allow for results in minutes.

This is an important step and it combines the local insight of the brilliant Directors of Public Health right across the country with our strong national infrastructure of NHS Test and Trace combining to keep our communities safe.

Vaccines

I also want to turn to vaccines. While we don’t yet have a vaccine, we can now have hope.

You may have heard the two promising pieces of news from earlier today.

First, Janssen’s Phase 3 clinical trials are beginning today in 17 sites across the country, including Southampton, Dundee, Cardiff and Belfast.

It’s the third vaccine to enter clinical trials here and should the trials come good, and that is by no means certain, and it can be proved to be safe and effective. We have 30 million doses on order by the middle of next year.

Finally, you will no doubt have seen the excellent news that Moderna have today announced results from their preliminary trial data, suggesting that their vaccine has an effectiveness of 94.5 per cent. This is another encouraging step forward, although I stress that this is preliminary.

The safety data is limited and their production facilities are not yet at scale.

Should this latest vaccine be approved, the doses would be available from spring next year.

And I can announce that we have today secured an initial agreement for 5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine.

It is a similar RNA technology to Pfizer/BioNTech, of which we have already ordered 40 million doses, which should that be proved to work will come on stream potentially at the end of this year.

Across diagnostics and vaccines, great advances in medical science are coming to the rescue. And while there is much uncertainty, we can see the candle of hope.

And we must do all that we can to nurture its flame but we are not there yet.

Until the science can make us safe, we must remain vigilant and keep following the rules that we know can keep this virus under control.

Now I’d like to hand over to Dr. Hopkins to say more about our work on mass testing.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-11-16,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-november-2020"
"23","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 18 March 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement on coronavirus.","Good afternoon. And thanks for coming or for indeed tuning in to these daily updates. I want to introduce, I’m sure you know Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, and you know Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Advisor.

I want to tell you where we got to in our national fightback against the coronavirus. Today the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies met to discuss the latest evidence on the spread of the virus and the effects of the measures we have already taken to slow its spread. And Patrick is going to update us in a second about that.

I want to repeat that everyone – everyone – must follow the advice to protect themselves and their families, but also – more importantly – to protect the wider public. So stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms. Remember the two key symptoms are high temperature, a continuous new cough.

Whole household to stay at home for 14 days if one member in that household thinks he/she has the symptoms. Avoid all unnecessary gatherings – pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, theatres and so on and work from home if you can. Wash your hands.

And we have already announced in the last few days we will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so we hit 25,000 tests a day.

A huge public information campaign is being rolled out so people get all the information they need to protect themselves and others.

We are asking retired healthcare professionals to come back and help us cope, help the NHS to cope, with this unprecedented challenge.

And we will continue as we have from the beginning to do the right thing at the right time and to follow the best scientific advice.

And we come today to the key issue of schools where we have been consistently advised that there is an important trade off.  And so far the judgment of our advisers has been that closing schools is actually of limited value in slowing the spread of the epidemic.

And that is partly because counterintuitively schools are actually very safe environments. And in this disease and epidemic children and young people are much less vulnerable.

And hitherto the advice has been that we should keep schools open if possible in order to reduce the pressure on the NHS and on all other public services. But I think you’ll agree I have always been very clear that this is a balanced judgment and one that we have kept under constant review.

So looking at the curve of the disease and looking at where we are now – we think now that we must apply downward pressure, further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing the schools.

So I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils – for the vast majority of pupils- until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils.

The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that.

But of course, as I’ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work.

And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too – from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups.

So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children.

This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning.

So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. We are making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear we will reimburse the cost. 
And of course this does mean that exams will not take place as planned in May and June. Though we will make sure that pupils get the qualifications they need and deserve for their academic career.

Now I know that these steps will not be easy for parents or teachers. And for many parents, this will be frustrating, and it will make it harder for them to go out to work.

And of course that is one of the reasons we haven’t wanted to go ahead and that’s why we are working now on further measures to ensure that we support not just businesses but also individuals and their families to keep our economy going as Rishi Sunak the Chancellor outlined yesterday.

I also need to remind parents that, as we have already advised, children should not be left with older grandparents, or older relatives, who may be particularly vulnerable or fall into some of the vulnerable groups and I know that will be difficult too. And I want to thank families for their sacrifice at this difficult time. I want to thank whole country for the efforts people are making to comply with these measures.

I particularly want to thank the teachers, head teachers and all the support staff who keep schools going who will make these exceptional arrangements work, for the benefit of us all.

By looking after the children of key workers they will be a critical part of our fightback against Coronavirus. As I have said, we will take the right steps at the right time, guided by the science.

We believe the steps we have already taken, together with those I am announcing today, are already slowing the spread of the disease.

But we will not hesitate to go further, and faster, in the days and weeks ahead.

And we will do whatever it takes to so that we beat it together.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-03-18,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-18-march-2020"

Good afternoon,

Welcome back to Downing Street for an update on coronavirus as we enter autumn and approach winter.

I will first hand over to Chris to take us through the latest data before I set out how we are responding to it.

Thank you Chris. It is clear from that very powerful graphic that we must act.

The most important thing every one of us must do is remember the basics.

First, wash your hands, regularly and for 20 seconds. Don’t get back into old habits, it is so vital.

Second, wear a face covering over your mouth and nose if you are in an enclosed space and in close contact with people you don’t normally meet. I know wearing a face covering feels odd to some people and I understand that. But face coverings do make it harder for the virus to spread – so please, wear one to protect others.

Third, make space. Always stay 2 metres away from people you don’t live with – or 1 metre with extra precautions, like extra ventilation, screens, or face coverings.

Fourth, if you have COVID symptoms, get a test and self-isolate. We are now processing 1.2 million tests a week. To date we have carried out 15.4 million antigen tests – that’s more than any other country in Europe, and more per head than other European countries like Germany and Spain.

We are increasing our testing capacity further to meet rising demand. You can help by only booking a test if you have a fever, a new continuous cough, or you’ve lost your sense of taste or smell – if you don’t have those symptoms and haven’t been asked to book a test, please don’t.

So those are the basics – hands, face, space – and get a test if you have COVID symptoms.

Since the pandemic began, we have asked you to reduce your social contact and limit your interactions with friends and family.

I know that, over time, the rules have become quite complicated and confusing. We have spoken to police officers about what they need for an effective enforcement regime and of course, listened to the feedback from you, the public.

In response, we are simplifying and strengthening the rules – making them easier for you to understand and for the police to enforce.

I should stress that if we are to beat the virus then everyone, at all times, should limit social contact as much as possible and minimise interactions with other households. It is safer to meet outdoors and you should keep your distance from anyone you don’t live with, even if they are close friends or family.

So in England, from Monday, we are introducing the rule of 6. You must not meet socially in groups of more than 6 – and if you do, you will be breaking the law.

This will apply in any setting, indoors or outdoors, at home or in the pub.

The ban will be set out in law and it will be enforced by the police – anyone breaking the rules risks being dispersed, fined and possibly arrested.

This single measure replaces both the existing ban on gatherings of more than 30 and the current guidance on allowing 2 households to meet indoors. Now you only need to remember the rule of 6.

There will be some limited exemptions. For example, if a single household or support bubble is larger than 6, they can still gather.

COVID Secure venues like places of worship, gyms, restaurants and hospitality venues can still hold more than 6 people in total. Within those venues however, there must not be individual groups larger than 6, and groups must not mix socially or form larger groups.

Education and work settings are unaffected, COVID Secure weddings and funerals can go ahead, up to a limit of 30 people, and organised sport will still be able to proceed.

As we have found on previous occasions, this rule of 6 will of course throw up difficult cases. For example, two whole households will no longer be able to meet if they would together exceed the limit of 6 people.

I am sorry about that and I wish that we did not have to take this step. But, as your Prime Minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to save lives.

We will of course keep the rule of 6 under constant review and only keep it in place as long as it’s necessary.

I also want to see – and the public wants to see – stronger enforcement of the rules which are already in place. So I’ve have tasked the Cabinet with increasing enforcement and I would like to thank the police, as always, and other authorities for the work they are doing to keep us all safe.

In future:

Premises and venues where people meet socially will be legally required to request the contact details of a member of every party, record and retain these details for 21 days, and provide them to NHS Test & Trace without delay when required.
  We will support local authorities to make further and faster use of their powers to close venues that are breaking the rules and pose a risk to public health.
  Fines will be levied against hospitality venues that fail to ensure their premises remain COVID Secure.
  We will boost the enforcement capacity of local authorities by introducing COVID Secure Marshalls to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres, and by setting up a register of Environmental Health Officers that local authorities can draw upon for support.
  We will simplify the Passenger Locator Form needed for travelling to the UK, and take measures to ensure these are completed and checked before departure.
  Border Force will step up enforcement efforts at the border to ensure arrivals are complying with the quarantine rules.
  We will also restrict the opening hours of premises, initially in some local areas.
At the present time we must also, I’m afraid, revise plans to pilot larger audiences in venues later this month and review our intention to return audiences to stadiums and conference centres from 1 October. That doesn’t mean we’re going to scrap the programme entirely it just means we are going to review and abridge it, and the Culture Secretary will say more shortly.

Let me be clear – these measures are not a second national lockdown – the whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown.

By bearing down on social contact and improving enforcement, we can keep schools and businesses open, in the knowledge they are COVID Secure.

I have always said schools and colleges should only ever be shut again as a very, very last resort. As the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser have said, the long term risks to children’s life chances of not going to school are significant and far greater than the health risks of going back to school.

Indeed it’s been fantastic to see so many children back in school this term and I want, once again, to thank all our teachers, and to reassure parents and pupils that schools are safe.

University terms will also begin soon. Opening universities is critical, again, for students’ life chances and, again, the health risks to individuals are low.

Of course, many university students are in the age bracket where we have seen the infection rates rise recently as Chris was just explaining. My message to students is simple. Please, for the sake of your education and your parents’ and your grandparents’ health: wash your hands, cover your face, make space, and don’t socially gather in groups of more than 6, now and when term starts.

Today the Department for Education is publishing updated guidance for universities on how they can operate in a COVID Secure way, including a clear request not to send students home in the event of an outbreak, so as to avoid spreading the virus across the country. I am very grateful to universities for their continued cooperation and planning for the return of students.

The measures I have set out today will help us control the virus but won’t, on their own, be enough to allow a more significant return to normality.

Patrick is going to set out in a moment where we are on vaccines and treatments in a moment, but we are not there yet and there are no guarantees.

So over the summer, we have therefore been working up an alternative plan which could allow life to return closer to normality. And that plan is based on mass testing.

Up to now, we have used testing primarily to identify people who are positive – so we can isolate them from the community and protect high risk groups. And that will continue to be our priority. We are working hard to increase our testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October.

But in future, in the near future, we want to start using testing to identify people who are negative – who don’t have coronavirus and who are not infectious - so we can allow them to behave in a more normal way, in the knowledge they cannot infect anyone else with the virus.

And we think, we hope, we believe that new types of test which are simple, quick and scalable will become available. They use swabs or saliva and can turn round results in 90 or even 20 minutes. Crucially, it should be possible to deploy these tests on a far bigger scale than any country has yet achieved – literally millions of tests processed every single day.

That level of testing would allow people to lead more normal lives, without the need for social distancing:

Theatres and sports venues could test all audience members on the day and let in those with a negative result, all those who are not infectious.
Workplaces could be opened up to all those who test negative that morning and allow them to behave in a way that was normal before COVID.
Those isolating because they are a contact, or quarantining after travelling abroad, could after a period be tested and released.
Now that is an ambitious agenda, but we are going to pilot this approach in Salford from next month, with audiences in indoor and outdoor venues. And then we hope to go nationwide.

There are a number of challenges. We need the technology to work. We need to source the necessary materials to manufacture so many tests. We need to put in place an efficient distribution network. And we need to work through the numerous logistical challenges.

And as I say, we are not there yet, and I should repeat that, as we manage this period of high demand, it is especially important that if individuals don’t have symptoms, and have not been specifically advised to take a test, they should not be coming forward for a test - because they could be taking a test away from someone who really needs it.

Our plan – this moonshot that I am describing – will require a giant, collaborative effort from government, business, public health professionals, scientists, logistics experts and many, many more.

Work is underway – and we will get on at pace until we get there, round the clock.

We are hopeful this approach will be widespread by the spring and, if everything comes together, it may be possible even for challenging sectors like theatres to have life much closer to normal before Christmas.

But as I have said before, all this progress is contingent on continued scientific advances and though we’re hopeful, I cannot 100% guarantee that those advances will be made.

That is why it is so important that we take these tough measures now.

I believe we will continue to drive this virus down and that we will beat this virus before too long.

So let’s work together and follow the rules: meet in groups of no more than six. Wash your hands, cover your face, and make space.

I will now hand over to Patrick to set out the latest on vaccines and treatments, and then we’ll go to questions from the public and the media.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-09-09,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-9-september-2020"
"25","Speech","Prime Minister's speech to United Nations General Assembly: 26 September 2020","At UNGA 2020 Boris Johnson outlined a new global approach to health security based on a 5-point plan to protect humanity against another pandemic like COVID-19.","Watch the Prime Minister’s speech

Never in the history of our species – not since the Almighty felled the Tower of Babel – has the human race been so obsessed with one single topic of conversation. We have been following the same debates, researching the potential of the same drugs, and time and again we have been typing the same word into our search engines. COVID-19, coronavirus, has united humanity as never before.

And yet the crisis has also been an extraordinary force for division. We have all been up against the same enemy. The same tiny opponent threatening everyone in much the same way, but members of the UN have still waged 193 separate campaigns, as if every country somehow contains a different species of human being. Across the world there has been an infinite variety of curfews and restrictions and closures, and we have fought in a spirit of sauve qui peut.

And the pace has been so urgent and the pressures so intense that each national government – democracy or otherwise – has decided entirely understandably to put the interests of its domestic population first. We have seen borders spring up between friends and allies, sometimes without consultation. We have seen the disruption of global supply chains with cheque book wars on airport tarmacs as nation has vied with nation for a supply of PPE.

And after 9 months of fighting COVID-19, the very notion of the international community looks, frankly, pretty tattered. And we know that we simply can’t continue in this way.

Unless we get our act together. Unless we unite and turn our fire against our common foe, we know that everyone will lose. The inevitable outcome would be to prolong this calamity and increase the risk of another.

Now is the time – therefore, here at what I devoutly hope will be the first and last ever Zoom UNGA –  for humanity to reach across borders and repair these ugly rifts. Let’s heal the world – literally and metaphorically. And let’s begin with the truth, because as someone once said, the truth shall set you free.

And with nearly a million people dead, with colossal economic suffering already inflicted and more to come, there is a moral imperative for humanity to be honest and to reach a joint understanding of how the pandemic began, and how it was able to spread – Not because I want to blame any country or government, or to score points. I simply believe – as a former COVID patient – that we all have a right to know, so that we can collectively do our best to prevent a recurrence.

And so the UK supports the efforts of the World Health Organisation and of my friend, Tedros, to explore the aetiology of the disease, because however great the need for reform, the WHO, the World Health Organization, is still the one body that marshals humanity against the legions of disease. That is why we in the UK – global Britain – are one of the biggest global funders of that organisation, contributing £340 million over the next 4 years, that’s an increase of 30%.

And as we now send our medical detectives to interview the witnesses and the suspects – bats, the pangolins, whoever – we should have enough humility to acknowledge that alarm bells were ringing before this calamity struck.

In the last 20 years, there have been 8 outbreaks of a lethal virus, any of which could have escalated into a pandemic. Bill Gates sounded the alert in 2015, 5 years ago he gave that amazing prediction – almost every word of which has come true – and we responded as if to a persistent Microsoft error message by clicking ‘ok’ and carrying on.

Humanity was caught napping. We have been scrabbling to catch up, and with agonising slowness we are making progress.

Epidemiologists at Oxford University identified the first treatment for COVID-19. They did trials with our national health service and found that a cheap medicine called dexamethasone reduces the risk of death by over a third for patients on ventilators. The UK immediately shared this discovery with the world, so that as many as 1.4 million lives could be saved in the next six months by this one, single advance.

And as I speak there are 100 potential vaccines that are trying to clear the hurdles of safety and efficacy, as if in a giant global steeplechase. We don’t know which may be successful. We do not know if any of them will be successful.

The Oxford vaccine is now in stage 3 of clinical trials, and in case of success AstraZeneca has already begun to manufacture millions of doses, in readiness for rapid distribution,  and they have reached agreement with the Serum Institute of India to supply one billion doses to low and middle-income countries.

But it would be futile to treat the quest for a vaccine as a contest for narrow national advantage and immoral to seek a head start through obtaining research by underhand means. The health of every country depends on the whole world having access to a safe and effective vaccine, wherever a breakthrough might occur; and, the UK, we will do everything in our power to bring this about.

We are already the biggest single donor to the efforts of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness to find a vaccine. And it is precisely because we know that no-one is safe until everyone is safe, that I can announce that the UK will contribute up to £571 million to COVAX, a new initiative designed to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine across the world. Of this sum, £500 million will be for developing countries to protect themselves.

The UK is already the biggest donor to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. In June we helped to raise almost $9 billion to immunise another 300 million children against killer diseases, and Gavi also stands ready to help distribute a COVID-19 vaccine.

But even as we strive for a vaccine, we must never cut corners, slim down the trials or sacrifice safety to speed. Because it would be an absolute tragedy if in our eagerness, we were to boost the nutjobs – the anti vaxxers, dangerous obsessives who campaign against the whole concept of vaccination and who would risk further millions of lives.

And now is the time above all to look ahead and think now about how to stop a pandemic from happening again. How can we stop another virus from coming along and again smashing that precious Ming vase of international cooperation?  How can we avoid the mutual quarantines and the brutal Balkanisation of the world economy?

I don’t think there is any reason for fatalism: of course, the dangers can never be wholly eliminated, but human ingenuity and expertise can reduce the risk.  Imagine how much suffering might have been avoided if we had already identified the pathogen that became COVID-19 while it was still confined to animals?

Suppose we had been able to reach immediately into a global medicine chest and take out a treatment? What if countries had been ready to join together from the outset to develop and trial a vaccine? And think how much strife would have been prevented if the necessary protocols – covering quarantine and data-sharing and PPE and so much else – had, so far as possible, been ready on the shelf for humanity to use?

So we in the UK we’re going to work with our friends, we’re going to use our G7 presidency next year to create a new global approach to health security based on a 5-point plan to protect humanity against another pandemic.

Our first aim should be to stop a new disease before it starts. About 60% of the pathogens circulating in the human population originated in animals and leapt from one species to the other in a ‘zoonotic’ transmission. The world could seek to minimise the danger by forging a global network of zoonotic research hubs, charged with spotting dangerous animal pathogens that may cross the species barrier and infect human beings.

The UK is ready to harness its scientific expertise and cooperate to the fullest extent with our global partners to this end. Of the billions of pathogens, the great mass are thankfully incapable of vaulting the species barrier. Once we discover the dangerous ones, our scientists could get to work on identifying their weaknesses and refining anti-viral treatments before they strike.

We could open the research to every country and as we learn more, our scientists might begin to assemble an armoury of therapies – a global pharmacopoeia – ready to make the treatment for the next COVID-19.

Our second step should be to develop the manufacturing capacity for treatments and vaccines So that the whole of humanity can hold them like missiles in silos ready to zap the alien organisms before they can attack. But if that fails and a new disease jumps from animals to human beings and overcomes our armoury of therapies and begins to spread, then we need to know what’s going on as fast as possible.

So the third objective should be to design a global pandemic early warning system, based on a vast expansion of our ability to collect and analyse samples and distribute the findings, using health data-sharing agreements covering every country. As far as possible, we should aim to predict a pandemic almost as we forecast the weather to see the thunderstorm in the cloud no bigger than a man’s hand.

And if all our defences are breached, and we face another crisis, we should at least be able to rely on our fourth step, and have all the protocols ready for an emergency response, covering every relevant issue, along with the ability to devise new ones swiftly.

Never again must we wage 193 different campaigns against the same enemy. As with all crises, it is crucial not to learn the wrong lessons. After the harrowing struggle to equip ourselves with enough ventilators – with countries scrabbling to improvise like the marooned astronauts of Apollo 13 – there is a global movement to onshore manufacturing. That is understandable.

Here in the UK we found ourselves unable to make gloves, aprons, enzymes which an extraordinary position for a country that was once the workshop of the world. We need to rediscover that latent gift and instinct, but it would be insane to ignore the insights of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

We need secure supply chains – but we should still rely on the laws of comparative advantage and the invisible hand of the market.  Many countries imposed export controls at the outset of the pandemic, about two thirds of which remain in force. Governments still target their trade barriers on exactly what we most need to combat the virus, with tariffs on disinfectant often exceeding 10%, and for soap tariffs for 30%.

So I would urge every country to take a fifth step and lift the export controls wherever possible – and agree not to revive them – and cancel any tariffs on the vital tools of our struggle: gloves, protective equipment, thermometers and other COVID-critical products. The UK will do this as soon as our new independent tariff regime comes into effect on 1st January and I hope others will do the same.

Though the world is still in the throes of this pandemic, all these steps are possible if we have the will. They are the right way forward for the world, and Britain is the right country to give that lead. And we will do so in 2021, as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of this great United Nations in London in January, and through our G7 Presidency, and as we host the world’s climate change summit, COP26, in Glasgow next November.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been an immense psychic shock to the human race. Global fears have been intensified by the immediacy of round the clock news and social media. We sometimes forget, we face a virus – a small package of nucleic acid that simply replicates. It is not even technically alive.

Tragic as its consequences have been, it has been nothing like as destructive as other plagues – let alone the influenza of a century ago. It is absurd, in many ways, outrageous that this microscopic enemy should have routed the unity of the human race.

COVID-19 has caused us to cease other vital work, and I’m afraid it made individual nations seem selfish and divided from each other. Every day people were openly encouraged to study a grisly reverse Olympic league table, and to take morbid and totally mistaken comfort in the greater sufferings of others.

We cannot go on like that, we cannot make these mistakes again. And here in the UK, the birthplace of Edward Jenner who pioneered the world’s first vaccine We are determined to do everything in our power to work with our friends across the UN, to heal those divisions and to heal the world.","Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-09-26,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-to-un-general-assembly-26-september-2020"

Good afternoon,

Two weeks ago, I updated you from this podium on the progress we had made as a country against coronavirus.
And in many ways that progress continues.

The number of patients admitted to hospitals is still falling, and now stands at just over 100 each day.
In April there were more than 3,000 coronavirus patients in mechanical ventilation beds, but now the latest figure is 87.

The number of deaths continues to fall. That is obviously encouraging

But I have also consistently warned that this virus could come back and that we would not hesitate to take swift and decisive action as required.

I am afraid that in parts of Asia and Latin America the virus is now gathering pace. And our European friends are also struggling to keep the virus under control.

As we see these rises around the world, we cannot fool ourselves that we are exempt. We must be willing to react to the first signs of trouble.

Today, the weekly survey by the Office for National Statistics reports that the prevalence of the virus in the community in England is likely to be rising for the first time since May.

Around 1 in 1,500 now have the virus, compared to 1 in 1,800 on 15 July and 1 in 2,000 on 2 July. The ONS also estimate there are now 4,900 new infections every day, up from around 3,000 per day on 14 July and 2,000 per day at the end of June

We can’t afford to ignore this evidence.

It’s vital to stress that we are in a far better position to keep the virus under control now than we were at the start of the pandemic – because we know so much more about the virus and have so many more tools at our disposal to deal with it.

Our testing capacity has increased 100-fold.

We have a contact tracing system up and running which has led to over 184,000 people isolating who may otherwise have spread the virus and is capable of tracing thousands of contacts every day.

We have secured supplies of billions of items of PPE to withstand new demands on hospitals and care homes.

And of course we have new treatments, like dexamethasone and remdesivir, to shorten recovery times and reduce mortality rates.

But as I say, we cannot be complacent. I cannot – I won’t stand by and allow the virus to cause more pain and heartache in this country.

Last night the Health Secretary announced new restrictions on household contact in the North West – specifically Greater Manchester, and parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire.

These are targeted measures on social contact between households, which the data tells us is driving the current increase in cases. Businesses and workplaces should continue as before in those areas.I know how it is hard to have restrictions like this imposed on seeing your family and your friends. But we have to act rapidly in order to protect those we love.

And we know this sort of intervention works – measures taken in Leicester and Luton have suppressed the virus, allowing us to relax measures.

Even as we act locally, it is also my responsibility to look again at the measures we have in place nationally in light of the data we are seeing about incidence.

At every point I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional – that it relies on continued progress against the virus, and that we would not hesitate to put on the brakes if required.

With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control.

On Saturday 1 August, you’ll remember, we had hoped to reopen in England a number of higher risk settings that had remained closed. Today, I am afraid we are postponing these changes for at least a fortnight.

That means that, until 15 August at the earliest:

Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services must remain closed.
Indoor performances will not resume.

Pilots of larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will not take place.

Wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted, but ceremonies can continue to take place, in line with COVID-Secure guidelines.

I know that the steps we are taking will be a heavy blow to many people – to everyone whose wedding plans have been disrupted, or who now cannot celebrate Eid in the way they would wish, I am really, really sorry about that. But we simply cannot take the risk.

We will of course study the data carefully and move forward with our intention to open up as soon as we possibly can.

Two weeks ago, I also said that from tomorrow the government would give employers more discretion over how employees can work safely – whether by continuing to work from home or attending a Covid Secure workplace. We know that employers have gone to huge lengths to make workplaces safe, so that guidance remains unchanged.
We also said we would pause shielding nationally from 1 August – based on clinical advice, that national pause will proceed as planned, and our medical experts will be explaining more about that decision later and about shielding later today.

Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their bit to control the virus. But we must keep our discipline, we must be focused and we cannot be complacent.

I have asked the Home Secretary to work with the police and others to ensure the rules which are already in place are properly enforced.

That means local authorities acting to close down premises and cancel events which are not following Covid Secure guidance.

And it means a greater police presence to ensure face coverings are being worn where this is required by law.
We will also extend the requirement to wear a face covering to other indoor settings where you are likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet, such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship.
We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings, and this will become enforceable in law from 8 August.

At this stage, we are not changing the rules on social contact nationally. I don’t want to tell people to spend less time with their friends. But unless people follow the rules and behave safely, we may need to go further.
Two weeks ago, I said we would hope for the best but plan for the worst.

And of course we continue to hope for the best. The way to get there and to achieve that optimum outcome is if we all follow the rules, wash our hands, cover our faces, keep our distance – and get a test if we have symptoms, so that NHS Test and Trace can keep the virus under control.

This is how we will avoid a return to full national lockdown.

We’ve made huge progress together.

I know we are going succeed and I know we are going to beat this – if each and every one of us plays our part.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-07-31,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-31-july-2020"

Good evening everyone,

Across the whole United Kingdom, people are engaged in a huge joint effort to put the coronavirus back in its box.
Throughout the pandemic, this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods – in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

We have put in place an unprecedented package of economic support, protecting the wages and jobs of millions of people.

We have built the largest testing capacity in Europe, with 32 million tests conducted so far and over half a million tests now available every day across the UK.

We have ensured that, as we head into winter, the NHS has at its disposal over 30,000 ventilators and billions of items of Personal Protective Equipment, most of it now manufactured here in the UK.

Across the whole of the UK, we have a shared goal – to suppress the virus, ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed, and in doing so to save lives.

The UK Government and the devolved administrations are working together on a joint approach to the Christmas period, because all of us want to ensure families can come together wherever they live.

The challenges we face are significant across the U.K.

The average number of new cases each day is now 22,398, that’s up from 9,716 a month earlier.

There are now 12,320 patients in hospital, up from 2,602 a month earlier.

1,142 patients are now in mechanical ventilation beds, up from 369 a month earlier.

Sadly 492 deaths were reported yesterday. The weekly average number of deaths each day is now 295, up from 53 a month earlier.

That’s why new restrictions are in place in each part of the UK.

In England, from today, we are once again asking you to stay at home.

As I explained on Saturday you can only leave home for specific reasons: for work if you can’t work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies.

The full rules, all of the details, are available at gov.uk/coronavirus and on the NHS Covid-19 app – please log on to see what you can and can’t do.

I know how tough this is:

For staff in the NHS and care homes, who are facing a tough winter on the frontline.

For families, who can’t meet in the way they would want to.

For businesses, forced to shut just as you are getting back on their feet.

I know many of you are anxious, weary and quite frankly fed up with the very mention of this virus

But I want to assure you this is not a repeat of the spring.

Schools, universities and nurseries are all staying open.

And these measures though they are tough are time-limited.

The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact.

So these rules will expire, and on 2 December we plan to move back to a tiered approach.

There is light at the end of the tunnel.

We have better treatments and techniques to take care of those in hospital, thanks largely to the ingenuity of British scientists.

Rapid testing is being rolled out on a massive scale – with city-wide testing starting tomorrow in Liverpool.

I am hugely grateful to the people of Liverpool for their participation in this pilot. I hope that by working together, we can get that great city on top of the virus.

More broadly, there is also the very real chance of safe and effective vaccines.

So taking those things together, these scientific advances can show us the way ahead.

And in the meantime, the government will continue to support people affected by these new restrictions.

As you know, we have protected almost 10 million jobs through furlough, and as the Chancellor announced earlier today, we are now extending the scheme through to March.

We are also extending our support for the self-employed, so that the next payment increases to 80 per cent of average profits.

We’re providing cash grants for businesses who are closed, worth more than £1 billion every month.

We are giving £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England to support businesses.

And a further £2 billion of funding is guaranteed for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

As we face these challenges together, we must look after those in most need.

As of September we have helped over 29,000 rough sleepers off the streets, two thirds of whom are now in settled accommodation.

Today we’re announcing a further £15 million to help councils offer safe accommodation for people who are sleeping rough or at risk of becoming homeless. This programme will help areas that need additional support most during the restrictions and throughout the winter.

These are difficult times.

And while it pains me to have to ask once again for so many to give up so much, I know that, together, we can get through this.

So please, for the next four weeks, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.

I’ll now hand over to the Head of NHS England Simon Stevens who’s going to talk about the NHS’s preparations for winter.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-11-05,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-november-2020"
"28","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 September 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement at the coronavirus press conference.","When I spoke to you all last week I explained that the number of Covid patients going into hospital had doubled in a fortnight

and I explained that the rate of infections was climbing steeply.

I said that we faced the sad reality that on these figures we could expect many more daily deaths.

And so that’s why we announced the package of restrictions and stronger enforcement last week.

At the same time we’ve been intensifying the local lockdowns in areas where the disease has been flaring up.

I want to say - I know how tough it is and has been for these communities

and I want to pay a particular tribute to the students who are experiencing a first term back at university unlike anything they could have imagined.

I can assure you, assure everybody at university, that plans are being put in place to allow students home safely for Christmas.

I wish I could tell you tonight that the impact of this package has already begun to appear but it will take time to feed through.

And yesterday we saw the biggest rise in daily cases since the pandemic began, today a further 7,108.

We’ve also had a tragic increase in the number of daily deaths – with 71 yesterday and again today.

And these figures show why our plan is so essential

We now have to stick to it together - and we should stick to it with confidence,

because there are many ways in which we are far better prepared than we were in March.

We are on track to hit our target of being able to conduct 500,000 tests a day by the end of October,

We’re already exceeding the number of tests per capita that are conducted in Germany, France and Spain.

We have over 2,000 beds that could be available across seven Nightingale hospitals, and we will be able to go further if needed.

We’ve ordered 32 billion items of PPE, and we’ll have a four month stockpile of masks, visors, gowns and other essentials for winter.

By December, by the way, we expect UK manufacturers will meet 70 per cent of the demand for PPE compared with just one per cent before the pandemic.

And in the last six months we have more than trebled the availability of mechanical ventilators to our NHS across the UK to 31,500.

But the best way forwards, to protect the NHS, save lives,

to keep our children in school and the economy moving,

is to follow the rules wherever we live.

So I want to thank everyone for the fantastic national effort that we are seeing, continuing to see

And no matter how impatient we may be, how fed up we may become

there is only one way of doing this,

and that’s by showing a collective forbearance, common sense and willingness to make sacrifices for the safety of others.

At this critical moment, when I know people will be wanting to know the details, I will be providing regular updates through these press conferences.

And I have to be clear, that if the evidence requires it, we will not hesitate to take further measures that would, I’m afraid, be more costly than the ones we have put into effect now

But if we put in the work together now, then we give ourselves the best possible chance of avoiding that outcome and avoiding further measures

I know some people will think we should give up and let the virus take its course, despite the huge loss of life that would potentially entail.

I have to say, I profoundly disagree.

And I don’t think it’s what the British people want, I don’t think they want to throw in the sponge, they want to fight and defeat this virus and that is what we are going to do.

Even as we fight Covid, it is vital that people get all the treatment they need for other conditions.

But I must be clear, if the NHS were to be overwhelmed by covid, then no-one could get any such care.

That’s why we must bear down on the virus now, so that we never reach that point,

and I am absolutely confident that with ever increased testing, with better treatments and of course with the prospect of a vaccine,

we will get through this.

So let’s follow the rules,

wash our hands, cover our faces, observe social distancing,

download the app, as 14 million of you have already done,

and together we will fight back against this virus,

protect our NHS and save many more lives.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-09-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-30-september-2020"
"29","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 September 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the nation on coronavirus.","PM address the nation on coronavirus 22 September

Good evening, the struggle against covid is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime.

In less than a year this disease has killed almost a million people, and caused havoc to economies everywhere.

Here in the UK we mourn every person we have lost, and we grieve with their families.

And yet I am more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win – and to achieve what we must I want to talk to you directly tonight about the choices that we face – none of them easy – and why we must take action now.

I know that we can succeed because we have succeeded before.

When the sickness took hold in this country in March, we pulled together in a spirit of national sacrifice and community. We followed the guidance to the letter. We stayed at home, protected the NHS, and saved thousands of lives.

And for months with those disciplines of social distancing we have kept that virus at bay.

But we have to acknowledge this this is a great and freedom-loving country; and while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches – too many opportunities for our invisible enemy to slip through undetected.

The virus has started to spread again in an exponential way. Infections are up, hospital admissions are climbing.

We can see what is happening in France and Spain, and we know, alas, that this virus is no less fatal than it was in the spring, and that the vast majority of our people are no less susceptible, and the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families losing loved ones before their time;

and I know that faced with that risk the British people will want their government to continue to fight to protect them, you, and that is what we are doing, night and day. And yet the single greatest weapon we bring to this fight is the common sense of the people themselves – the joint resolve of this country to work together to suppress covid now.

So today I set out a package of tougher measures in England – early closing for pubs, bars; table service only; closing businesses that are not covid secure; expanding the use of face coverings, and new fines for those that fail to comply;

and once again asking office workers to work from home if they can while enforcing the rule of six indoors and outdoors – a tougher package of national measures combined with the potential for tougher local restrictions for areas already in lockdown. I know that this approach – robust but proportionate – already carries the support of all the main parties in parliament.

After discussion with colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, I believe this broad approach is shared across the whole UK. And to those who say we don’t need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own.

The tragic reality of having covid is that your mild cough can be someone else’s death knell.

And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable – with all the suffering that would entail – I must tell you that this is just not realistic, because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers.

That’s why we need to suppress the virus now, and as for that minority who may continue to flout the rules, we will enforce those rules with tougher penalties and fines of up to £10,000. We will put more police out on the streets and use the army to backfill if necessary.

And of course I am deeply, spiritually reluctant to make any of these impositions, or infringe anyone’s freedom, but unless we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later, when the deaths have already mounted and we have a huge caseload of infection such as we had in the spring.

If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space – once again – to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-covid medical needs.

And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend.

It would mean renewed loneliness and confinement for the elderly and vulnerable, and ultimately it would threaten once again the education of our children. We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again.

But if people don’t follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further. We must take action now because a stitch in time saves nine; and this way we can keep people in work, we can keep our shops and our schools open, and we can keep our country moving forward while we work together to suppress the virus.

That is our strategy, and if we can follow this package together, then I know we can succeed because in so many ways we are better prepared than before.

We have the PPE, we have the beds, we have the Nightingales, we have new medicines – pioneered in this country – that can help save lives.

And though our doctors and our medical advisers are rightly worried about the data now, and the risks over winter, they are unanimous that things will be far better by the spring, when we have not only the hope of a vaccine, but one day soon – and I must stress that we are not there yet - of mass testing so efficient that people will be able to be tested in minutes so they can do more of the things they love. That’s the hope; that’s the dream. It’s hard, but it’s attainable, and we are working as hard as we can to get there.

But until we do, we must rely on our willingness to look out for each other, to protect each other. Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour.

If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together. There are unquestionably difficult months to come.

And the fight against covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead.

But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-09-22,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-september-2020"
"30","Speech","PM Commons statement on coronavirus: 22 September 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement on coronavirus to the House of Commons.","Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will make a statement on our response to the rising number of Coronavirus cases

and how we must act now to avoid still graver consequences later on.

At every stage in this pandemic we have struck a delicate balance between saving lives by protecting our NHS

and minimising the wider impact of our restrictions.

And it is because of the common sense and fortitude of the British people

that earlier this year we were able to avert an even worse catastrophe,

forming a human shield around our NHS,

and then by getting our country moving again by reopening key sectors of our economy and returning children to school.

But we always knew that while we might have driven the virus into retreat, the prospect of a second wave was real.

And I am sorry to say that - as in Spain and France and many other countries - we have reached a perilous turning point.

A month ago, on average around a thousand people across the UK were testing positive for Coronavirus every day.

The latest figure has almost quadrupled to 3,929.

Yesterday the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser warned that the doubling rate for new cases could be between seven and 20 days with the possibility of tens of thousands of new infections next month.

I wish I could reassure the House that the growing number of cases is merely a function of more testing,

but a rising proportion of the tests themselves are yielding a positive result.

I also wish I could say that more of our people now have the antibodies to keep the virus off,

but the latest data suggest that fewer than 8 per cent of us are in this position.

It is true that the number of new cases is growing fastest amongst those aged 20-29,

but the evidence shows that the virus is spreading to other more vulnerable age groups,

as we have seen in France and Spain

where this has led to increased hospital admissions and, sadly, more deaths.

In the last fortnight, daily hospital admissions in England have more than doubled.

Tens of thousands of daily infections in October would, as night follows day, lead to hundreds of daily deaths in November and those numbers would continue to grow unless we act.

And as with all respiratory viruses, Covid is likely to spread faster as autumn becomes winter.

Yesterday, on the advice of the four Chief Medical Officers, the UK’s Covid alert level was raised from 3 to 4, the second most serious stage, meaning that transmission is high or rising exponentially.

So this is the moment when we must act.

If we can curb the number of daily infections, and reduce the Reproduction rate to 1,

then we can save lives, protect the NHS, and the most vulnerable,

and shelter the economy from the far sterner and more costly measures that would inevitably become necessary later.

So we are acting on the principle that a stitch in time saves nine.

The Government will introduce new restrictions in England,

carefully judged to achieve

the maximum reduction in the R number

with the minimum damage to lives and livelihoods.

I want to stress that this is by no means a return to the full lockdown of March.

We are not issuing a general instruction to stay at home.

We will ensure that schools, colleges and universities stay open - because nothing is more important than the education, health and well-being of our young people.

We will ensure that businesses can stay open in a Covid-compliant way.

However, we must take action to suppress the disease.

First, we are once again asking office workers who can work from home to do so.

In key public services – and in all professions where homeworking is not possible, such as construction or retail – people should continue to attend their workplaces.

And like Government, this House will be free to take forward its business in a Covid-secure way

which you, Mr Speaker, have pioneered.

Second, from Thursday all pubs, bars and restaurants must operate table-service only, Mr Speaker, except for takeaways.

Together with all hospitality venues, they must close at 10pm.

To help the police to enforce this rule, I am afraid that means alas closing, and not just calling for last orders. Simplicity is paramount.

The same will apply to takeaways - though deliveries can continue thereafter.

I am sorry this will hurt many businesses just getting back on their feet, but we must act to stop the virus from being transmitted in bars and restaurants.

Third, we will extend the requirement to wear face coverings to include staff in retail,

all users of taxis and private hire vehicles,

and staff and customers in indoor hospitality, except when seated at a table to eat or drink.

Fourth, in retail, leisure, tourism and other sectors, our Covid-secure guidelines will become legal obligations.

Businesses will be fined and could be closed if they breach these rules.

Fifth, now is the time to tighten up the rule of six.

I’m afraid that from Monday, a maximum of 15 people will be able to attend wedding ceremonies and receptions.

Though, up to 30 can still attend a funeral as now.

We will also have to extend the rule of six to all adult indoor team sports.

Finally, we have to acknowledge that the spread of the virus is now affecting our ability to reopen business conferences, exhibitions and large sporting events

so we will not be able to do this from 1 October.

And I recognise the implications for our sports clubs, which are the life and soul of our communities,

and my RH Friends the Chancellor and Culture Secretary are working urgently on what we can do now to support them.

Mr Speaker, these rules measures will only work if people comply.

There is nothing more frustrating for the vast majority, the law-abiding majority that do comply than the sight of a few brazenly defying the rules.

So these rules will be enforced by tighter penalties.

We have already introduced a fine of up to £10,000 for those who fail to self-isolate and such fines will now be applied to businesses breaking Covid rules.

The penalty for failing to wear a mask or breaking the rule of six will now double to £200 for a first offence.

We will provide the police and local authorities with the extra funding they need,

a greater police presence on our streets,

and the option to draw on military support where required to free up the police.

The measures I have announced all apply in England and the Devolved Administrations are taking similar steps.

I spoke yesterday with each of the First Ministers and again today and I thank them for their collaboration:

the health of everyone in these islands depends on our common success.

Already about 13 million people across England are living under various local restrictions, over and above national measures.

We will continue to act against local flare-ups, working alongside councils and strengthening measures where necessary.
And I want to speak directly to those who were shielding early in the pandemic and may be anxious about being at greater risk.
Following advice from our senior clinicians, our guidance continues to be that you do not need to shield – except in local lockdown areas – and we will keep this under constant review.
I must emphasise that if all our actions fail to bring the R below 1,

then we reserve the right to deploy greater firepower,

with significantly greater restrictions.

I fervently want to avoid taking this step, as do the Devolved Administrations,

but we will only be able to avoid it if our new measures work and our behaviour changes.

Mr Speaker, we will spare no effort in developing vaccines, treatments and new forms of mass-testing

but unless we palpably make progress, we should assume that the restrictions I have announced will remain in place for perhaps six months.

For the time being, this virus is a fact of our lives and I must tell the House and the country that our fight against it will continue.

We will not listen to those who say let the virus rip;

nor to those who urge a permanent lockdown;

we are taking decisive and appropriate steps to balance saving lives with protecting jobs and livelihoods.

I know all of this will have profound consequences for our constituents,

so the government will give the House every opportunity to scrutinise our decisions.

In addition to regular statements and debates,

Hon Members will be able to question the government’s scientific advisers more regularly,

gain access to data about their constituencies, your constituencies

and join daily calls with my RH Friend the Paymaster General.

After six months of restrictions,

it would be tempting to hope that the threat has faded,

and seek comfort in the belief that if you have avoided the virus so far then you are somehow immune.

I have to say that it is that kind of complacency that could be our undoing.

If we fail to act together now we will not only place others at risk

but jeopardise our own futures with the more drastic action that we would inevitably be forced to take.

Mr Speaker, no British government would wish to stifle our freedoms in the ways that we have found necessary this year.

Yet even now we can draw some comfort from the fact that

schools and universities and places of worship are staying open,

shops can serve their customers,

construction workers can go to building sites,

and the vast majority of the UK economy can continue moving forwards.

We are also, Mr Speaker, better prepared for a second wave,

with the ventilators, the PPE, the dexamethasone, the Nightingale Hospitals, and a hundred times as much testing.

So now it falls to each of us and every one of us to remember the basics – wash our hands, cover our faces, observe social distancing – and follow the rules.

Then we can fight back against this virus,

shelter our economy from even greater damage,

protect the most vulnerable in care homes and hospitals,

safeguard our NHS

and save many more lives.

And I commend this statement to the House.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-09-22,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-commons-statement-on-coronavirus-22-september-2020"
"31","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 March 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a press conference on coronavirus.","This morning I chaired a meeting of the government’s COBR emergency committee on the Coronavirus outbreak.

The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales and the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland also attended and we agreed to continue to work closely in the weeks and months ahead.

We received a detailed briefing from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Advisor. And again I repeat my gratitude to both Chris and to Patrick.

There have now been four deaths from coronavirus in the UK, and our deepest sympathies are obviously with their friends and families.

Our action plan as you know sets out the four phases of our approach to tackling the virus: Contain, Delay, Research, and Mitigate.

We remain in the Contain phase of the outbreak, but watching what is happening around the world, our scientists think containment is extremely unlikely to work on its own, and that is why we are making extensive preparations for a move to the delay phase.

We are preparing various actions to slow the spread of this disease in order to reduce the strain it places on the NHS. The more we can delay the peak of the spread to the summer, the better the NHS will be able to manage.

Patrick and Chris will give you some more detailed information on the latest advice we are giving the public today - and how we expect that advice to change as the outbreak develops.

As things stand I’m afraid it bears repeating that the best thing we can all do is wash our hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. We will also take questions, because I know there are lots of things the public want to hear from our advisors about.

But before that I want to stress the following things:

First, we are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice.

Second, we have a truly brilliant NHS, where staff have responded with all the determination, compassion and skill that makes their service so revered across the world. And they will continue to have this government’s full support, my support, in tackling this virus on the frontline.

Third, we will set out further steps in the days and weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particular the elderly and vulnerable.

And finally, while it is absolutely critical, it’s absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time, based on the latest and best evidence. So we must not do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out to be counterproductive.

There is no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK, just as it does in other countries.

But if we continue to look out for one another, to pull together in a united and national effort, I have no doubt that we can and will rise to that challenge. And I’m now going to ask Patrick and then Chris to give their own perspective on where we are.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-03-09,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-9-march-2020"

Thank you for having me. Staring at screens might be the norm these days, but that doesn’t make it any easier, or more enjoyable! I hope you will bear with me for the next 20 minutes or so, before we open up to questions.

First, I want to thank you for everything that you’ve been doing over the past few months – holding it together for children in the toughest circumstances. There’s no sign of this abating, with a new lockdown now in force. But, while there’s been the stop, start and stop again of normal life, your work, and ours, has of course had to continue.

We’ve seen some of this work first-hand: despite routine inspections being suspended in March, we were determined to help the wider COVID effort where we could. From April, around 700 of our staff and inspectors were deployed to other organisations – from the Department for Education to the Department of Health and Social Care, and alongside you in many of our local authorities.

If there was any doubt at the outset, this was absolutely not about gathering intel! Rather, we wanted to help and to build capacity. In local authorities, this took many forms, from child protection work to manning foodbanks. Some of our staff even volunteered as foster carers. We really were guided by you on where we could be most useful.

The experience gave an insight into the challenges you have been facing, and our inspectors, I can tell you, really did value being closer to frontline practice.

In all areas, the hard work and dedication of your people shone through. Staff going through the same difficulties as the rest of us as lockdown began to bite, but who got the job done for children and families regardless.

I’m very proud that Ofsted was able to help, even if in quite a small way. Just as I’m sure that you are very proud of your staff.

COVID-19 issues

Like Ofsted, many of you watching today have a wide reach. Overseeing not only children’s services and vulnerable families, but with responsibilities for early years, and schools too. COVID is still a significant challenge in every area of that work.

On the one hand, you’re contending with the logistics of schools and early years providers operating in unusual circumstances – the nuts and bolts: making sure that children get to school, that transport works safely. Doing your bit to help schools, nurseries and childminders stay open, as well as all the other vital services.

On the other, you will have been trying to keep your eyes on the children at risk of falling from view. The impact of COVID on children’s visibility has been one of our biggest concerns – as I’ve said repeatedly. A concern that I’m sure you share.

COVID has affected every one of us, but children have had to absorb much of the damage. Because time and again, they’ve come second to other national priorities. So, I’m pleased that, for this lockdown at least, closing schools is a red line. It really is so important that we have children in school, not just for their education, but for their safety and security too.

As you know, schools are among the top referrers to children’s social care. But, over the summer, with schools closed and health visitors working in the acute sector, referrals to children’s social care dwindled in some places. Helping the children you are aware of during a pandemic is a challenge in itself. But, you can’t care for those you can’t see. And just because the phone isn’t ringing, it doesn’t mean that children aren’t suffering.

And of course, this vacuum has been filled, up to a point. Most schools are now open, which is of course reassuring. But the issues affecting children haven’t magically been resolved. School referrals are still low, as is the attendance of vulnerable pupils.

And, although attendance figures are actually pretty decent, our autumn school visits have shown a rise in the number of parents opting to home educate their children. For some, it’s a positive choice here – having enjoyed putting on their ‘teacher hat’ over the summer.

Heads tell us that many parents are keeping children at home because they’re worried about their safety. Of course, as a parent, it’s completely natural to feel concern and want the best for your child. But it’s frustrating if much of this is being sparked by ‘fake news’ and misinformation on social media, which is what we’re hearing.

And of course, schools aren’t immune from misinformation either. There are myths doing the rounds about what schools ‘have’ to do, or must not do, such as no singing or swimming and keeping all doors open, no matter the weather. And there are indications that schools may sometimes be sending pupils home too readily. So, a consolidation and simplification of government advice for schools would be helpful for teachers and parents alike as we head towards the winter.

And, as I’m sure you’ll recognise, there will sadly be parents who want to avoid scrutiny, to keep their children out of sight – exploiting the situation to their own ends.

And quite a proportion of the children now being educated at home have special educational needs. For children with severe disabilities in particular, the closure of schools and other services has been devastating. We really are talking about children being left without access to therapy and education for months.

And here, many parents haven’t made an active decision to keep their child at home – they’ve been told that schools can’t accommodate them. Because it’s too difficult, because COVID risk assessments won’t allow it. It’s deeply concerning and, understandably, many parents feel cut adrift.

For the children with SEND that have been able to get back into education, it hasn’t been plain sailing either. We’re hearing that many have suffered setbacks in their communication skills – probably down to having reduced social interaction for such a long time. And, although some people are working really creatively to help families, this is an ongoing concern. We’ll be looking at this more in the next report from our autumn visits.

Under-1s

I think it’s fair to say that the effects of lockdown are being felt particularly keenly by very vulnerable children.

We’re now on the second day in a fresh lockdown, and the message from government is that school closures remain a last resort. While this is good for our line of sight, there are other issues here. Tighter restrictions have brought increased tensions for many, especially in the most troubled families.

We’re all spending more time at home these days. And for most children, that’s a place of comfort at best, boredom at worst. But for some, sadly, it’s a source of danger.

The pandemic has brought difficult and stressful times. Financial hardship, loss of employment, isolation and close family proximity have all put extra pressure on families who were already struggling. Poverty, inadequate housing, substance misuse and poor mental health – they all add to the toxic mix. You’ll be well aware of the increase in domestic violence incidents over the summer – just one symptom of the COVID pressure cooker.

Perhaps one of the most alarming trends that we’ve seen is the continuing rise in incidents of harm to the youngest and most vulnerable of all children, the under-1s. Of course, babies can’t tell an adult if there’s a problem. Often, abuse is only uncovered when there’s a critical injury, or when it’s too late. Another young life damaged, and in the worst cases, lost, before it’s really had chance to begin.

I’m sure you share our worry. Every week, we are seeing notifications from local authorities about babies that have died or been seriously harmed through abuse or neglect.

The figures are stark. Between April and October, we saw over 300 serious incident notifications. A significant proportion of these – almost 40% – were about babies, over a fifth more than in the same period as last year. And tragically, over half of these cases – that’s 64 children – suffered non-accidental injuries. And sadly, 8 died as a result.

It doesn’t bear thinking about. But we must all be alive to this hidden danger.

Violence towards babies was already a worry before COVID. Over a quarter of all incidents reported to the Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel last year involved non-accidental injuries to babies. Children being abused, often by young parents, or other family or household members, who had very little social support.

As well as babies being intentionally harmed, we’re seeing a high number of unexpected infant deaths. Some, apparently preventable tragedies: babies not being put down to sleep safely, sharing a bed or sofa with a parent who has been drinking, for example.

And we know that there has been good work going on to identify high-risk babies during lockdown before the unthinkable happens. For example, work to prevent harm to the children of parents misusing substances, or with serious mental health problems. Situations where professionals understand the risk factors and have acted decisively to give families the help they need, or take action where they need to.

There is a great deal of expertise out there and we know that you are well aware of the risks. But everyone needs to play their role. That includes professionals across whole communities. Midwives, health visitors, GPs and other health workers who have good relationships with families and can build on that trust. Staff working in schools and nurseries who may have information about a vulnerable infant because an older sibling attends the setting.

And help for younger parents is important, but without labelling or patronising them. Building their trust so that they accept advice and learn how to look after their children safely.

And as ever, we cannot overstate the importance of curiosity here. It may not always be comfortable territory. But the right questions protect children. All professionals who work with a family where there is a new baby have a role to play. Consider how well parents are coping, and if there’s any help that they might need. And we need to make sure that all staff and volunteers understand the risk factors and what to do if they spot them.

Continuing restrictions may be hampering face-to-face visits. But, while these children are out of sight, they should never be out of mind.

Visits update

But the rebuilding effort has begun, and I believe that Ofsted has a role to play here. We’re doing what we can to help education and care through a particularly tough period, and to help us all learn from the COVID experience.

Of course, safety is important. But it’s also important that children get the education they need after so long without the usual structures in place.

We’re making visits to give that assurance to parents, and to government and commissioners, about what’s happening for children. As I’ve said before, this absolutely isn’t inspection, and we aren’t handing out graded judgements.

Out of all the evidence we gather, we are publishing thematic briefing notes. These reports pull together what we’ve found is happening all across England. And they give everyone an overview of how schools, colleges, early years and of course local authorities and social care providers are responding.

I hope you’ll have seen the reports we published in early October. We will be publishing another in a few days’ time which will look at schools and local authorities. And there will be more reports in December, along with a fuller thematic report in the new year.

On the schools side, the visits are going well. Feedback so far has been heartening. Schools tell us that the visits are a positive experience, that there is true dialogue and that inspectors are genuinely keen to hear what has been going on. They are also clear that we are doing what we said we would: the visits were non-judgemental and genuinely collaborative.

And just as importantly, we’re hearing that the conversations are helping schools to reflect on their plans, refine their priorities and celebrate the things that have gone well.

Because schools are doing some solid, thorough work. For example, I heard of one school, knowing that attendance might be quite patchy in September, that was doing a really good job providing absent pupils with all of the lessons they missed, to do at home. They’d done it in a really low-tech way, using their existing digital platforms, simple resources, careful communication with parents and a well-managed approach to teacher workload.

Let’s not pretend that the challenges aren’t great, but we are seeing schools approaching these challenges intelligently and having some notable success in returning to some normality.

Again, on the social care side, the visits have been very productive. We’ve visited 14 local authorities and more than 600 children’s social care providers so far. Each visit results in a published letter, but we are reporting on the national picture too, as I’ve described.

Our most recent briefing note sets out what we found during our visits to children’s homes in September. And despite the challenges that homes are facing, there has been a great deal of good work going on.

Staff have been working very hard to keep homes COVID-secure, while helping children live as normally as possible. Homes were making good use of technology to help children keep in contact with their families. For some children, this is actually having unexpected benefits, particularly those who normally find direct contact with family or social workers stressful. This could become a lasting legacy of lockdown in cases where direct contact isn’t in a child’s best interests.

Our next set of briefings, in a few days’ time, will give a round-up of our first visits to local authorities. On the one hand, we are seeing some excellent work with children and care leavers, despite the restrictions  – although we still have concerns about the drop off in referrals and the children you can’t see.

But it’s also clear that pressures on the family court have significantly hampered your ability to issue care proceedings to protect children, as well as delaying adoption and other permanence arrangements. Clearly, this isn’t good for children. We understand that virtual court proceedings are helping with the backlog in some areas, but it’s not clear what impact these new arrangements are having on families.

Overall, the sector has been very receptive to the visits – so thank you. We understand the pressure that you are under, and do not want to add to it, in any way. This isn’t about judging – rather, offering reassurance to families, those commissioning services and central government. Identifying shared challenges and providing feedback on areas for improvement.

We’ve been reflecting on the first set of visits and considering your feedback very carefully. You can be sure that we’ll make changes where we need to. Yvette has already written to you to give you a heads up about our thinking. We will keep you updated as this progresses.

Now, of course, we are in another lockdown, so the position has to shift, though I hope temporarily. We will be working remotely where we can – only going on site where it’s necessary to do so, or in response to urgent concerns. That means our programme of autumn visits to schools and colleges will be done remotely for the time being. But we will revert to in-person visits after the lockdown.

We’re also pausing ILACS and area SEND visits. We appreciate that some of you will already have prepared for your visit. But we think this is the right thing to do, so that you and your teams can respond to local issues and focus on maintaining frontline services.

And we’re pausing our SCCIF assurance visits, instead prioritising monitoring visits to homes based on our risk assessment, with a mix of on  and off site work, depending on the circumstances.

We will still take action in response to safeguarding or other serious concerns, and carry out our vital social care and early years regulatory work, as you would expect. And we’ll carry on registering new early years and children’s home providers.

We will resume our assurance visits as soon as we can. And, looking ahead, our plan remains to bring back full ILACS and SCCIF inspections next April at the start of the regulatory year.

Work in lockdown

The first lockdown was an unusual time for us, as routine inspections were suspended. But of course, our regulatory work didn’t suddenly stop in March.

In fact, demand for children’s homes places increased, so we have been prioritising children’s homes registrations. We wanted to make sure that there are as many places as possible for the children who need them.

We’ve worked hard to fast-track applications and register new homes. That includes using technology and virtual ‘visits’ to help us when visits in person weren’t possible – all the while prioritising children’s welfare. This isn’t about cutting corners.

Since March, we’ve had more than 280 applications to register new children’s homes, and around 80% of those are now open. But we haven’t let standards drop though – not every application was suitable or successful.

Building capacity is vital, but we have to make sure children are safe and getting good quality care. COVID hasn’t stopped us from taking enforcement action when we need to. Since March, we’ve suspended the registrations of nearly 20 children’s homes and restricted accommodation at over 20 more.

Sufficiency

So, we do now have more children’s homes registered than ever, and also a slight rise in places. But, while we can celebrate the increase in homes to a point, we haven’t suddenly solved the sufficiency problem. Demand carries on increasing.

There weren’t enough places when COVID began. And this pressure on places is only set to continue. Getting good-quality placements where they are needed has to be a priority for everyone.

Getting the right placement for a child really matters. And, not every local authority is doing all it can. Not only are people not matching well, they are also not making sure that all children are living somewhere decent – the use of unregistered placements does remain a concern.

We fully understand the challenging context – there is nothing like enough suitable specialist provision to go around. But that’s no excuse for using placements that are patently unsafe. We always expect you to make good decisions for children, no matter how difficult the circumstances.

And we carry on sharing information, so you know about unregistered homes. That includes telling all councils in England and Wales when we issue a cease and desist letter, so that you know not to use these places.

And we’ll carry on working with the DfE to make sure that our powers are fit for purpose, and to inform the debate on capacity. We know that these issues are very much on the government’s radar, and despite the pressure on legislative time, I’d urge them not to lose momentum.

Foster care

Of course, sufficiency isn’t just an issue in children’s homes. Today we published our report on matching in foster care. We all know the vital role that foster carers play.

Yet, as our report shows, a chronic shortage of carers is making successful matches for children difficult. This is particularly acute for groups of brothers and sisters, for disabled children and teenagers.

You know the importance of really good matching. It can make all the difference to children’s futures. Get a placement right, and a child will feel stable and loved, and that they have a real home. They can get on and enjoy their lives. But where matches don’t work, there’s more distress and instability for children who have had a great deal of disruption in their lives already.

We also know that unsuccessful matches are closely linked to foster carers taking a break from fostering or deciding to stop fostering altogether. Given the pressure that the care system is under, that’s really the last thing we need.

Our research looks at what makes a really good match. As you’d expect, the best matches happen when a child’s individual needs, as well as the skills and experience of foster carers, are properly understood.

Giving children the information they need about potential carers, taking their feelings into account and making sure that foster carers know everything that they need to know about a child all help matches to work and last.

We saw some really excellent work with children and foster carers. But this kind of practice isn’t universal. There is much more that could be done to make sure children are as prepared as possible for a move, and that what they want is taken into account.

Going to live with people who are, to all intents and purposes, complete strangers, is an enormous step for a child. Their needs and wishes should always be at the centre of decisions.

Please, do give our report a read when you have chance.

Early years

It’s only right that I touch on early years, as I’ve barely mentioned it yet. Again, as in children’s social care, our regulatory work continued over the summer.

We wanted to make sure that there would be a steady flow of new providers to help parents. Quite early in the summer, we started getting back to on site pre-registration visits, so that new childminders could registered, new nurseries could open, and new branches of nurseries established. Between June and August this year we were able to register 680 childminders and nearly 600 new nurseries and pre-schools.

Children’s mental health

I also want to give a plug to our JTAI report on children’s mental health, which we’re publishing next month.

Mental health is something that everyone is taking more seriously these days, and that’s generally a good thing. But, especially with children, we aren’t always good at recognising where an intervention is needed, and where there are temporary problems and upsets that will pass with time.

We all remember how hard it is being a teenager! There are lots of emotions at play. Not to mention hormones! And, while some things clearly need professional treatment, others don’t. There’s a danger that we over-intervene in some cases, and not enough in others.

CAMHS are already under a great deal if pressure. If we don’t get this distinction right, the system gets clogged. And then, when some children do desperately need specialist help, they don’t get it when they need it.

Just because it’s important for people working with children to be aware of mental health considerations, it doesn’t make everyone an expert. We’d never encourage schools to diagnose children’s physical conditions, and rightly so. And yet, we constantly invite teachers to use the language of mental illness when this is widely removed from their area of expertise.

Of course, teachers have a role here – they know their pupils and often notice when something isn’t right. But it’s equally important that they know when to hand the baton over to those with the expertise. That way, children are more likely to get the help that they need.

Our JTAI report takes a look at how partner agencies are working together to help children who need those specialist mental health services. The study is an overview of joint inspections with the CQC and others that we did before lockdown – but I think the findings have particular resonance now.

And the report actually presents a pretty positive picture, with agencies working well together to improve services and to make them more accessible.

In the areas we visited, specialist CAMHS had been restructured to improve pathways, and to provide better support to professionals and parents. Children were being identified and getting the services they need sooner – though there were still gaps in all areas, and some children were still having to wait too long.

Joint working

So, what should we all be putting our efforts into over the next few months?

It’s a cliché, but joint working really is vital. Just because everyone says that partnership working is the key, doesn’t make it less true. On one hand, this is about systems – every local partner sharing the right information at the right time, as I mentioned earlier. Equally, being confident in their own roles and expertise, and when it’s the right time to draw in other partners. And it’s also about culture. All partners need a leadership approach that puts children first, and encourages professional support and challenge.

Unsurprisingly, COVID has reinforced just how important it is for agencies to collaborate. In fact, our autumn visits to local authorities have shown much better multi-agency working, with some professionals finding that the move to virtual communication has made it easier to join up. It’s important that we don’t lose these gains.

On our part, there has been a great deal going on behind the scenes. Along with your representatives, we’ve been working closely with government over the last few months to help influence and shape policy. Using our insights about you – and the challenges that you’re facing – to help policymakers make sensible decisions.

Conclusion

And all that’s left for me to say is to reiterate my thanks for everything that you’re doing for children, in the most trying circumstances.

I know you see the importance of our role too. We are here to help, not hinder. Rest assured, we will carry on making sure that we play our part intelligently, responsibly and constructively – as we have done from the very start.

And no matter where your conference is next year, I am very much looking forward to being there in person.

"33","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 March 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement on coronavirus.","Good afternoon everyone

Thank you for coming, and thank you to Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, and Dr Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer.

I want again to thank everyone in the country today for the huge effort that we are collectively making.

I want to thank the amazing workers in the NHS, everybody working in social care, in every sector, in food distribution, transport, you name it – absolutely everyone who is keeping this country going today.

And I want to thank everyone who is being forced to do something differently today.

Everyone who didn’t visit their mum for Mother’s Day but Facetimed them, Skyped them, rang them instead.

Thank you for your restraint and for what you did.

Everyone who was forced to close a pub or a restaurant or a gym or any other business that could have done fantastic businesses on a great day like this.

Thank you for your sacrifice, I know how tough it must be.

And I can tell you again that this government will be standing behind you – behind British business, behind British workers, employees, self-employed – throughout this crisis.

And the reason we are taking these unprecedented steps to prop up businesses, support businesses and support our economy and these preventative measures is because we have to slow the spread of the disease and to save thousands of lives.

Today we have come to the stage of our plan that I advertised at the outset, when we first set out the plan of the UK government.

When we have to take special steps to protect the particularly vulnerable.

I said the moment would come where we needed to shield those with serious conditions. There are probably about 1.5 million in all.

And in a minute Robert Jenrick will set out the plan in detail.

But this shielding will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out to save life. That is what we want to do.

Also to reduce infection and to slow the spread of the disease.

We have to do more to make sure that the existing measures that we are taking are having the effect that we want.

So it is crucial that people understand tomorrow that the schools are closed.

And tomorrow you should not send your child to school unless you have been identified as a key worker.

And more generally in the view of the way people have responded over the last few days to the measures we have set out I want to say a bit more about how we interact outdoors.

Of course I want people to be able to go to the parks and open spaces and to enjoy themselves – it is crucial for health and mental and physical wellbeing.

But please follow the advice and don’t think that fresh air in itself automatically provides some immunity.

You have to stay two metres apart; you have to follow the social distancing advice.

And even if you think you are personally invulnerable, there are plenty of people you can infect and whose lives will then be put at risk.

And I say this now – on Sunday evening – take this advice seriously, follow it, because it is absolutely crucial.

And as I have said throughout this process we will keep the implementation of these measures under constant review and, yes of course, we will bring forward further measures if we think that is necessary.

Always remember that in following this advice- and I know how difficult that is – that each and every one of us.

You are doing your bit in following this advice to slow the spread of this disease.

The more we collectively slow the spread, the more time we give the NHS to prepare, the more lives we will save, the faster we will get through this.

And always remember – we will get through this, and we will beat it together.

Next Robert Jenrick to outline the shielding measures.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-03-22,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-22-march-2020"

Good evening,  two weeks ago, I set out the progress we as a country have made against our five tests for adjusting the lockdown, and the measures we could introduce as a result.

And today, I want to update you again on those five tests and set out some further changes we can now make.

So can I have the first slide please?

The five tests are designed, as you know, to ensure that any changes to the lockdown are careful, proportionate, and safe.

They combine analysis of the latest data on the spread of the disease with assessments of how well we are placed to meet the operational challenges posed by the virus.

We must do everything in our power to avoid a second peak of infection that overwhelms the NHS - because that would lead to more lives lost, more families in mourning, and more disruption to our economy and way of life.

Next slide please.

Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.

It’s thanks to the efforts of those working in the NHS that we can still be confident the NHS can cope.

On 7 June, 443 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, down from 628 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,431 on 1 April.

And on 9 June, 492 patients with coronavirus were in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 848 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.

So that means we are still meeting the first test.

Next slide please.

Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.

And of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, I am sad to say that 41,128 have now died. That’s an increase of 245 fatalities since yesterday.

As measured by a 7-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 200, down from 300 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.

So the death rate has continued to fall, and so the second test is still being met.

Next slide please.

Our third test is to receive reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection - the number of people catching Covid - is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.

In total, 290,143 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, which is an increase of 1,003 cases since yesterday.

The seven day rolling average of new positive cases found through testing is now 1,419, down from 2,416 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 5,195 in the first week of May.

In a moment, Sir Patrick will talk us through SAGE’s latest assessment of the R and other evidence on infection rates.

Based on the various data available, the government is satisfied the third test is being met.

Next slide please.

Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.

Yesterday 170,379 tests were carried out or posted out across the UK, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. The total now stands at 6,042,622.

Tomorrow the Health Secretary will provide an update on how NHS Test and Trace is performing.

On PPE, we have secured over 150 deals with new suppliers around the world and procured 2.2 billion items of PPE to be manufactured domestically.

Despite the immensely frustrating difficulties we have faced with PPE and testing in the past, this progress means we are now satisfied that the fourth test is being met - though of course we remain vigilant.

Next slide please.

Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS.

I am grateful to the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their advice on the measures I am about to set out – and on this basis I can confirm the Government judges we have met the fifth test.

Therefore, the Government is satisfied that all five tests are still being met and we can proceed with the following further adjustments to the lockdown in England.

A month ago I set out our roadmap to recovery and that explained the gradual steps we would take to ease the lockdown, as the data and the evidence allows. The measures it contained were all conditional on continued progress in tackling the virus. We are continuing to follow our roadmap, while adjusting our approach as we need to, as we always said we would.

Although we are tackling this virus as one United Kingdom, it remains the case that the devolved administrations are responsible for lockdown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And it is right that they move at the right pace for them, according to their circumstances.

For that reason, the specific measures I am about to set out apply in England only.

First, on retail, shops. This has been the most challenging period for shops and high streets in our history. Never before have all shops been ordered to shut in this way. It has now been 82 days since we asked these shops to close their doors and I know the toll this has taken.

Which is why I am so pleased that, as the Business Secretary confirmed yesterday, we can now allow all shops to reopen from Monday. It is vital that establishments should ensure they are meeting Covid Secure guidelines before they reopen.

That way we can keep staff and customers safe while we get retail going.

Second, on social contact. I know how difficult the past months have been for people cut off from their friends and family.

Last Monday, we relaxed the rules on meeting outdoors so that groups of up to 6 could gather, provided they are socially distant. We did so in the knowledge that transmission of the virus is much lower outdoors, so we could make this change in a safe way.

But there are still too many people, particularly those who live by themselves, who are lonely and struggling with being unable to see friends and family.

From this weekend, we will allow single adult households - so adults living alone or single parents with children under 18 - to form a “support bubble” with one other household.

All those in a support bubble will be able to act as if they live in the same household - meaning they can spend time together inside each others’ homes and do not need to stay 2 metres apart.

I want to stress that support bubbles must be exclusive - meaning you cannot switch the household you are in a bubble with or connect with multiple households. And if any member of the support bubble develops symptoms, all members of the bubble will need to follow the normal advice on household isolation.

We are making this change to support those who are particularly lonely as a result of lockdown measures. It is a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions. It is emphatically not designed for people who don’t qualify to start meeting inside other people’s homes - that remains against the law.

Unfortunately, we cannot advise anyone who is shielding to form a support bubble at this stage, given their particular vulnerability to the virus. However, I want to say I know how hard it is for those of you who are shielding, and we will say more next week about the arrangements that will be in place for you beyond the end of June.

Third, on outdoor attractions. Because the risk of transmission is lower outdoors, we can open up some more outdoor attractions for people to enjoy this summer.

So from Monday, we will allow outdoor attractions where people can stay in their cars, such as safari parks and drive-in cinemas to open.

I am very grateful to the zoo industry for their cooperation and forbearance, and am happy to confirm that they too can reopen from Monday, provided visitor numbers are managed and safeguards put in place. That includes keeping indoor areas such as reptile houses closed and facilitating social distancing.

Finally, we will allow places of worship to open for individual prayer this weekend. And I hope that will be of some comfort to those of faith who have been unable to go to their place of worship.

As set out in our roadmap, the next set of changes - Step 3 - will not begin until 4 July at the earliest, as the evidence allows.

I know that these changes are only incremental and that some of you, many of you, may be hoping and waiting for more.

I also know that people will once again find anomalies or apparent anomalies in what people can and cannot do.

And as I have said before, I’m afraid that is just inevitable when we are only able to give people a small amount of the freedoms that they usually enjoy.

We will continue to remain cautious and measure the effect of the changes that we make. And as I’ve always said, we won’t hesitate to apply the brakes if that is what the situation requires.

That has meant moving slower than we would have liked in some areas.

It is because the rate of infection is not yet quite low enough, and because we are not able to change our social distancing advice including smaller class sizes in schools, that we are not proceeding with our ambition to bring back all primary pupils at least for some weeks before the summer holidays. Instead we are working with teachers to bring back as many pupils as we can within those smaller class sizes.

We do fully intend to bring all children back to school in September, provided the progress we are making continues, which I hope it will. That is our focus and it is consistent with the approach that has been taken by many other countries in Europe.

In the meantime we must stick to our roadmap.

I urge everyone to continue to show restraint and respect the rules which are designed to keep us all safe. It’s only because of the restraint that everyone, you all have shown so far that we are able to move gradually out of this lockdown.

So please, to repeat what you’ve heard so many times before, stay alert, maintain social distancing and keep washing your hands.

Help control the virus by getting tested if you have symptoms and isolating if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace.

Then, if we all do that together, we will all save lives and begin to rebuild our country.

And I’ll now hand over to Sir Patrick.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-06-10,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-coronavirus-press-conference-10-june-2020"
"35","Speech","The future of public health","Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock spoke at Policy Exchange about the future of public health.","One of America’s most renowned Surgeons General, Everett Koop, once said:


  Health care is vital to all of us, some of the time, but public health is vital to all of us all of the time.


If the last 6 months have taught us anything, surely they have taught us that no-one is untouched.

Public health is not narrow: public health comes from everything.

The air we breathe, the food we eat, how we protect ourselves and our communities from threats from afar.

The coronavirus pandemic has shone a light on our public health system, just as it has on so much of modern life.

And we have learned a lot – about this virus – about what has worked and what needs to change.

And about what we need, in order to be in the best possible position to fight COVID-19, to fight all infectious diseases, and prevent ill health now and long into the future.

Our nation’s public health experts have delivered incredible work during this pandemic.

Just as they did in the response to Ebola, novichok and countless small outbreaks of diseases like norovirus and meningitis that no one ever hears about because our public health teams quietly and efficiently do their job day in, day out.

Over the past few months, we have seen some extraordinarily talented people working so hard to tackle coronavirus.

Our public health scientists were one of the first to sequence the genome of COVID-19 at Porton Down and Colindale, who created a diagnostic test for coronavirus at blistering speed, and who, working alongside local directors of Public Health, have given us the boots on the ground to investigate and quash outbreaks at a local level.

And the research, especially from Public Health England, has been some of the best that’s been done into this novel disease, about which we of course knew nothing, just a few short months ago.

And I want to say this very directly to all of my colleagues in public health, colleagues at Public Health England, local directors of public health and their teams, contact tracers, diagnostics experts, epidemiologists, infection control teams, and every single person who has contributed to this national effort.

You have been working round the clock since January.

You have done exceptional work and I am so proud of the part you have played in tackling this pandemic.

And with winter ahead, the life-saving work you are doing is more important than ever.

The changes that I am announcing today are designed entirely to strengthen our response.

To ensure that the system works, to help you do your vital work.

We are making the change now because we must do everything we can to fulfil our responsibilities to the public. To strengthen public health in the UK.

I take my responsibilities incredibly seriously to get this right. As Secretary of State, it is me who is accountable to Parliament for how the system operates.

And I want to make sure that we have the best possible system, having learned everything we’ve learned during this crisis so far.

The world has not seen a pandemic on this scale in modern times.

And while we have some of the best public health science in the world, including of course, the world’s leading vaccine candidate and the world’s only scientifically proven treatment for COVID-19, we did not go into this crisis with the capacity for a response to a once-in-a-century scale event.

For example, even though we have some of the best labs in the world, we couldn’t call upon the large private sector diagnostics industry that some other countries were able to.

As a result, we’ve had to respond at an unprecedented rate.

To build our testing capacity at scale, to build a contact tracing system of a size never envisioned before and to boost our analytical capability, through the Joint Biosecurity Centre.

Alongside of course building the NHS capacity we needed, including through the Nightingale hospitals, again at a pace never seen before here, to make sure the NHS was never overwhelmed.

And so, to give ourselves the best chance of beating this virus – and of spotting and tackling other external health threats, now and in the future, we need to bring together the science and scale into one coherent whole.

So today I am announcing that we are forming a new organisation: the National Institute for Health Protection.

The National Institute for Health Protection will have a single and relentless mission: protecting people from external threats to this country’s health.

External threats like biological weapons, pandemics, and of course infectious diseases of all kinds.

It will combine our world-class talent and science infrastructure with the growing response capability of NHS Test and Trace and the sophisticated analytical capability we are building in the Joint Biosecurity Centre.

Of course, these institutions work incredibly closely together already today.

But I want that integration to be seamless.

Crucially, it will be a national Institute that works very much locally, working with local directors of public health and their teams, who are the unsung heroes of health protection.

Their local insight and intelligence is a mission-critical part of our response.

The National Institute for Health Protection will also work closely with the devolved administrations, taking on existing UK-wide responsibilities, and supporting all 4 Chief Medical Officers with access to the best scientific and analytical advice.

By bringing these parts of the system together, we can get more than the sum of the parts.

And the mission is for a purpose. So we have a stronger, more joined-up response to protect people and the communities in which they live.

The NIHP will report directly to ministers, and support the clinical leadership of the Chief Medical Officers.

It will be dedicated – dedicated – to the investigation and prevention of infectious diseases and external health threats.

That will be its mission. It is conceived amid crisis but it will help maintain vigilance in the years to come.

Prevention

PHE of course have other incredibly important responsibilities – centred around health improvement – and these are absolutely vital too.

As the Prime Minister made abundantly clear with the launch of our Obesity Strategy last month, we are passionately committed to health improvement – the prevention agenda.

And of course the 2 are linked, protection and prevention: we’ve seen how conditions like obesity can increase the risk for those who have coronavirus.

Levelling up health inequalities and preventing ill health is a vital and a broad agenda.

It must be embedded right across government, across the NHS, in primary care, pharmacies, and in the work of every local authority.

So we will use this moment to consult widely on how we embed health improvement more deeply across the board, and I’ll be saying more on this over the coming weeks.

This will in turn allow the National Institute for Health Protection to focus, focus, focus on the science and the scale needed for pandemic response, that mission.

We have been looking at best practice from all over the world. We want to build an institution that constantly strives to be the very best.

Role of the NIHP

Today, as I launch the new National Institute for Health Protection, I want to say 3 things that I believe are critical for this new institution to succeed.

About response, resilience, and about culture too.

Response

First, the immediate task of the NIHP is to pull together in one place the operational capabilities for the COVID response.

While we hold out bright hope for the success of brilliant scientists who are working day and night on a vaccine, no vaccine is guaranteed to succeed.

So, each day we must strengthen our response:

Drive up testing capacity, bring on new technologies, contact trace thousands to protect them and their communities, and analyse and understand this virus more and more and more.

So we have no time to lose.

To my brilliant colleagues at PHE, I want to thank you, each and every one of you, for the service you have provided and will continue to provide.

In particular I want to thank Duncan Selbie, who has led PHE with distinction for the last 7 years, and his senior management team.

I am delighted that Duncan will support PHE and the NIHP throughout this transition and continue his sterling work on behalf of the UK overseas.

And I want to welcome Michael Brodie, who has a wealth of experience and a brilliant track record of delivery, who will step up as interim Chief Executive during the transition.

From today, PHE, the JBC and NHS Test and Trace will operate under single leadership, reporting to Baroness Dido Harding, who will establish the NIHP, and undertake the global search for its future leadership.

And I have no doubt that under Baroness Harding, we will found the NIHP as a thriving mission-driven organisation.

We have a common mission. The greatest mission of any of our working lives.

And we have no time to lose in building the institution of the future.

Resilience and preparedness

Next, while of course we must focus on immediate response, so too must we improve resilience and preparedness, not just for coronavirus but for the next threat that lies around the corner.

We are living in an increasingly inter-connected world.

The UN projects that by 2050, over two-thirds of the global population will live in increasingly large, dense urban centres.

External threats to public health can emerge and spread quickly, and can reach our shores within days.

My single biggest fear is a novel flu, or another major health alert, hitting us right now, in the middle of this battle against the coronavirus pandemic.

Even once this crisis has passed – and it will pass - we need a disease control infrastructure that gives us the permanent standing capacity to respond as a nation, and the ability to scale up at pace.

One of the lessons, I believe, from the crisis is that we need an institution whose only job is to look out with constant vigilance to prepare for and respond to external health threats like pandemics.

So as well as bringing together our core pandemic response capabilities into one place, the NIHP will bring focus.

It’s worth dwelling on this point for a moment.

The question of how to protect a country from risks that are infrequent, yet devastating, is not restricted to infection control.

Think of how we work to prevent terrorism, and protect financial stability, for instance.

Just as with pandemic preparedness, there can be years between major threats materialising, especially when things go well.

The public policy challenge is how to build a system that is resilient and stays alert for years on end – learning, preparing, ready.

We can learn from abroad, from countries like South Korea, and from Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, where their health protection agencies had a huge primary focus on pandemic response.

We will build the same focus here.

So we will ensure the NIHP has the strongest possible function for intelligence, data analytics and surveillance, and a standing capacity to act fast at scale.

So we can remain equal to any future threats.

Culture

The third thing I want to say is something about working culture.

The National Institute for Health Protection will succeed by building an institution with the most revered expertise, in a culture that is open, outward-looking, non-hierarchical, and embraces the potential of its whole team.

Getting this culture of rigour and speed, of expertise and inquisitiveness, of outward-looking confidence, is critical to success.

Over centuries our country has contributed so much to global public health, and the life chances it brings.

We’re the home of Edward Jenner, who arguably saved more lives than anyone else in human history, with his pioneering vaccine for smallpox.

And John Snow, who just a few miles from here, used data in effectively one of the world’s first contact tracing exercises, using epidemiological methods to help the world understand how infectious diseases like cholera really spread.

In fact John Snow’s insight, that published highly specific local data, helps people tackle a contagious disease, is as vital today as it was in 1854.

We have incredible expertise in this country.

We need to support that expertise to flourish, in a way that meets the fast-moving demands of public health in the 21st century.

The creation of any new organisation provides a real opportunity to build and cement its culture.

This new Institute will focus on what works, bringing in ideas and expertise from wherever it can be found.

And it will support a culture of collaboration and change, shunning silos and unnecessary bureaucracy.

It will work seamlessly to harness the capabilities of academia and groundbreaking and innovative private companies with whom we must work so closely to get the best result.

It will work hand in glove with the NHS, and it will use the most modern, cutting-edge digital and data analytics tools at its core.

These are the qualities that will allow us to deal not just with today’s threats, but tomorrow’s threats too.

Conclusion

The first responsibility of any government is the protection of its citizens.

And threats to public health are among the most important of all.

Because it is only if people feel safe and secure in the environment that they live in that they have the confidence to start a business, play an active part in their community, and enjoy all the incredible experiences that life has to offer.

Threats like this coronavirus pandemic can emerge anywhere, and at any time.

So we must be ready. Ready to beat this virus, and protect all of us, all of the time, over the years to come.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-08-18,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-future-of-public-health"

Good evening everyone.

We are entering a new and crucial phase of our fight against Coronavirus.

Because the number of cases has gone up four times in four weeks

and it is once again spreading among the elderly and vulnerable.

There are already more Covid patients in UK hospitals today than there were on 23 March when the whole country went into lockdown

and deaths, alas, are also rising once again.

These figures are flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet.

And we must act now.

So we are giving local authorities across England around a billion pounds so they can protect vital services as they fight the virus.

Nightingale Hospitals across the North of England are being prepared for service.

And so we can squash this virus wherever it appears

we are today simplifying, standardising and in some places toughening local rules in England by introducing three levels of Covid Alert.

Medium, with existing national measures such as the Rule of Six and the closure of hospitality at 10pm.

High, with extra measures including a ban on indoor social mixing between households or support bubbles.

And Very High, for places where, without further action, the NHS will swiftly be under intolerable pressure.

Areas within the Very High Alert category will be reviewed every four weeks and nowhere will be shut down indefinitely.

And the exact restrictions at this level, Very High, will be worked out with local leaders, along with tailored packages of support.

But at a minimum they will, sadly, include a ban on all social mixing between households in private places, including gardens

and pubs and bars must close unless they can operate solely as a restaurant, serving alcohol only as part of a main meal.

We will also ask people not to travel into and out of Very High alert level areas.

Nobody affected by this will be left to fend for themselves.

And we will expand our unprecedented economic support to assist those affected by these decisions,

extending our Job Support Scheme to cover two-thirds of the wages of those in any business that is required to close,

and providing those businesses with a cash grant of up to £3,000 a month, instead of £1500 every three weeks,

and extra funding too for those in the Very High category for local test and trace and enforcement.

You will shortly be able to type in your postcode into Gov.UK and see exactly what restrictions apply where you live.

The majority of the country will, for now, be at medium.

Most areas currently under local intervention will be at High,

and Nottinghamshire, including Nottingham itself, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will also move to this level.

Over the weekend we have been working with local leaders in areas where the data are most worrying.

And from Wednesday, local authorities in the Liverpool City Region will move to the Very High alert level.

In addition to pubs and bars we have agreed with Liverpool City mayor Steve Rotheram that gyms, leisure centres, betting shops, adult gaming centres and casinos will close.

We are still working with other local leaders to determine how best to tackle the resurgence of the virus in their areas.

But tackle it we will.

No one, least of all me, wants to impose these kinds of erosions of our personal liberty,

but I am as convinced as I have ever been that the British people have the resolve to beat this virus

and that, together, we will do just that.

With that I’ll hand over to the Chancellor, who has some more details on how we’ll be supporting these businesses, employees and areas affected by today’s changes.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-10-12,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-12-october-2020"

Coronavirus press conference 25 March 2020.

Good afternoon.

Thank you for joining us for today’s daily briefing on coronavirus.

I would like to update you all on the government’s plan to defeat the virus and on the latest developments.

I am joined once again by our Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and the Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance.

From the very beginning of this crisis I have followed the advice of our world-leading scientists.

To defeat coronavirus by taking the right measures at the right time.

What everyone needs to recognise is that our NHS – like any world-class health service – has only limited numbers of doctors, nurses and specialist equipment.

So, the more people who become sick at any one time, the harder it is for the NHS to cope.

And so it is vital to delay the spread of the disease and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time.

That is why we have given the clear instruction that people must stay at home – unless they have one of the reasons we have set out.

And, with your help we will slow the spread of the disease.

I want to thank everyone who has been following the clear rules that we set out on Monday.

And I want to thank everyone in the NHS, the front line of the fight against coronavirus.

And of course all our public services.

Our teachers and our school staff, the transport workers, police officers,

And everyone who is keeping this country going.

But I also want to offer a special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS.

When we launched the appeal last night we hoped to get 250,000 over a few days.

But I can tell you that in just 24 hours 405,000 people have responded to the call.

They will be driving medicines from pharmacies to patients.

They will be bringing patients home from hospital.

Very importantly they’ll be making regular phone calls to check on and support people who are staying on their own at home.

And they will be absolutely crucial in the fight against this virus.

That is already – in one day – as many volunteers as the population of Coventry.

And so, to all of you, and to all the former NHS staff who are coming back now into the service.

I say thank you on behalf of the entire country.

Now I want to take some questions but finally I want to remind everyone of our core policy:

Stay at home

Protect the NHS

And save lives.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-03-25,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-25-march-2020"
"38","Speech","Prime Minister's statement to the House of Commons on coronavirus: 4 November 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement on coronavirus to the House of Commons.","Mr Speaker, I beg to move that these Regulations are approved and that we come together today to implement time-limited restrictions across England from midnight, so we can contain the Autumn surge of the virus,
protect our NHS and save many lives.

Of course, this not something that any of us wanted to do.

None of us came into politics to tell people once again to shutter their shops,

To furlough their staff, or stay away from their friends and family.

And I feel the pain and anxiety that we all share in the month ahead.

But as Prime Minister, when I am confronted with data that projects our NHS could even collapse, with deaths in this second wave potentially exceeding those of the first; and when I look at what is happening now amongst some of our continental friends and see doctors who have tested positive being ordered alas to work on covid wards,
and patients airlifted to hospitals in some other countries simply to make space,

I can reach only one conclusion: I am not prepared to take the risk with the lives of the British people.

And I know, Mr Speaker, it might be tempting to think that because some progress has been made we just need to stay the course and see through our locally led approach.

And it is true that the extraordinary efforts of millions across the country

especially those in high and very high alert level areas – they have made a difference, Mr Speaker suppressing the R, the reproduction rate of the virus below where it would have otherwise have been

And I want to record again my thanks again to the millions who have put up with local restrictions,

and I want to thank the local leaders who have understood the gravity of the position.

But I am sorry to say that the number of Covid patients in some hospitals is already higher than at the peak of the first wave.

Even in the South West, which has so far had lower case rates than most of the rest of the country, hospital admissions are over half way to their first wave peak.

SAGE’s latest analysis, published on Friday, suggests that the R remains above 1 in every part of England,
which means the virus is continuing to grow among the population.

And every day that the number is above one, is another day that the number of cases will rise

locking in, more hospital admissions and alas more fatalities.

and pushing the NHS ever closer to the moment when it cannot cope.

The course we have before us is to prevent the R from going back remaining above one and to get it down.

Otherwise we face a bleak and an uncertain future of steadily rising infections and admissions until as I say the capacity of the NHS is breached.

And I know there has been some debate about the projections from some of these models, for example, exactly how big the loss of life might be, or the precise point at which the NHS might be overwhelmed, but all the scientific experts that I have talked to are unanimous on one point

As the Chief Medical Officer has said –
“if we did not act now, then the chance of the NHS being in extraordinary trouble in December would be very, very high.”

And be in no doubt Mr Speaker what that means for our country and for our society.

It means that the precious principle - of care for everyone who needs it, whoever they are and whenever they need it – that principal could be shattered for the first time in our experience

It means those who are sick and suffering and in need of help - could be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals Mr Speaker even in East Sussex Mr Speaker.

Doctors and nurses could be forced to make impossible choices about which patients would live and would die, who would get oxygen and who couldn’t.

And I know that there are some Members like my honourable friend who are hearing from their local hospitals that the pressure is not that great yet.

But the whole point about a National Health Service, is that when hospitals in one part of the country are over-run,
sick patients are transferred to another, until the whole system falls over.

And let me be clear this existential threat to our NHS comes not from focusing too much on Coronavirus, as is sometimes asserted but from not focusing enough.

Because if we fail to get Coronavirus under control, it is the sheer weight of demand from Covid patients that would not only lead to the covid casualties that I’ve described but which would deprive other patients of the care they need.

We simply cannot reach the point where our National Health Service is no longer there for everyone.

And Mr Speaker this fate is not inevitable.

We are moving to these national measures here when the rate both of deaths and infections is lower than they were for instance in France, when President Macron took similar steps.

If we act now and act decisively we can stem the rising waters before our defences are breached.

And this approach, these regulations I do believe are the way we can do that.

Mr Speaker, I know there are many in the House who are concerned about how long these measures might last, and that if people vote for these regulations today, they could suddenly find that we are trapped with these national measures for months on end.

So let me level with the House.

Of course, I cannot say exactly where the epidemiology will be by 2nd December,

But what I can say is that the national measures – that I hope the House will vote on tonight - are time-limited.

It is not that we choose to stop them.

They legally expire.

So whatever we decide to do from 2nd December will require a fresh mandate and a fresh vote from this House.

And as I have made clear, it is my express intent that we should return to a tiered system on a local and a regional basis according to the latest data and trends.

Mr Speaker, the whole House will share my sorrow and regret at the necessity of these measures,
particularly for businesses who had just got back on their feet Mr Speaker, who had done their level best to make themselves Covid-secure,
installing handwashing stations, plexiglass screens, one-way systems

And as the Chancellor has set out, we will do whatever it takes to support them.

We have protected almost 10 million jobs with furlough, and we are now extending this scheme throughout November.

We have already paid out £13 billion to help support the self-employed, and we are now doubling our support from 40 to 80 per cent of trading profits for the self-employed for this month.

We’re providing cash grants of up to £3,000 per month for businesses who are closed - worth over £1 billion a month and benefiting over 600,000 business premises.

We are giving funding of £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England, to further support businesses and their local economy in the winter months.

And this comes on top of the more than £200 billion we’ve provided since March.

And we will also ensure that throughout this period that our schools stay open.

We will not allow this virus to do any further damage to the future of our children.

I said in the Summer we had a moral duty to reopen our schools as soon as it was safe to do so and that they would be the last element of society to close down again.

And we have stuck to that pledge Mr Speaker

Our schools will remain open, as will colleges, universities, childcare and early years settings.

Mr Speaker, the measures before the House are designed to arrest the virus, to drive it down and to get on top of it once and for all.

If we are able to test on a big enough scale to identify the people who are infected – often without symptoms and who unwittingly, asymptomatically pass the virus to others then those people will be helped immediately – this is the key thing - to self-isolate and break the chains of transmission, and reducing the spread of the virus –reducing the number of people in hospital, reducing the number of people dying.

I think that if we all play our part in this system it could be a hugely valuable weapon in our fight against Covid in the short medium and long term, and an alternative to the blanket restrictions that have been imposed in so many parts of the world.

We are piloting this week a mass test in Liverpool, where an immense effort benefiting from the logistical skill of the armed services will offer everyone a test.

And our aim is to make mass and repeated testing available for everyone across the country.

Thanks to the pioneering work of British scientists, we already have a life-saving treatment for Covid and the genuine possibility of a safe and effective vaccine next year.

Taken together, these achievements provide every reason for confidence that our country can and will pull through this crisis and that our ingenuity will prove equal to the challenge.

Mr Speaker, this year I and the whole government has asked much of the British people.

More than any Prime Minister I believe has asked of the British people in peacetime.

And I have to say that the public have responded magnificently and selflessly.

Putting their lives on hold, bearing any burden, overcoming every obstacle and tolerating every disruption and inconvenience no matter how large or small or inconsistent Mr Speaker so that they can do the right thing by their fellow citizens.

I wish that it had been enough to defeat this Autumn surge.

But while I am more optimistic now, more optimistic about the medium and long-term future than I have been for many months, there can be no doubt that the situation before us today is grave, and the need for action acute.

It is absolutely right for this House – for members on all sides of this House- to have the doubts that have been expressed, to seek answers from me and to provide scrutiny.

That is the purpose and duty of the House of Commons.

But, while it pains me to call for such restrictions on lives, liberty and business, I have no doubt that these restrictions represent the best and safest path for our country, our people and our economy.

So now is the time for us to put our differences aside and focus on the next four weeks, getting this virus back to its box.

And I know that, once again, our amazing country will respond to adversity by doing what is right – staying at home, protecting the NHS, and saving lives.

And in that spirit, I commend these regulations to the House.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-11-04,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-coronavirus-4-november-2020"

I am very glad to be joined today not just by Sir Patrick Vallance but by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak who is going to tell us more in a moment about our latest package to help this country in its battle with Covid.

And I want to thank Rishi for measures that will protect people’s livelihoods and protect jobs and which will help us to deliver our overwhelming objective of getting the virus under control while keeping pupils in education and keeping the UK economy moving forward.

I know that there are some people who will say that this economic objective is so important that we should stop all measures to control the virus and stop restrictions of any kind on our social lives or on the way we run our businesses.

We can’t do that because alas the maths is inescapable. We would face many thousands more deaths.

And no, to answer one commonly posed question, we would not be able to insulate the elderly and the vulnerable. Not in a society with so many multigenerational households. No country has been able to do that.

And an uncontrolled expansion in the number of Covid patients would mean that the NHS would have even less capacity to treat heart patients and cancer patients and to deal with all our other medical needs.

So that’s why we reject that extreme laissez-faire approach.

And then there are others who say on the contrary that we need now to lock the whole place down from John O’ Groats to Lands’ End.

Turn the lights out, shut up shop. Close schools and universities and go back to the same kind of lockdown we had in March and April and May.

And I have to say I don’t believe that is the right course now. Not when the psychological cost of lockdown is well known to us and the economic cost.

Not when it is being suggested that we might have to perform the same brutal lockdown again and again in the months ahead.

And not when there is such obvious variation – unlike last time – between different parts of the country.

So that’s why we are going for a balanced approach.

A middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus.

A regional and local approach - the same approach that is now being followed by some of the countries that are the most successful in their fights against the virus.

And so to all those who are enduring these restrictions, and who have been enduring them for so long in all parts of the country.

I want to repeat my thanks, for your bravery, for your patience and your public spiritedness.

And I repeat – there are clear signs that our collective actions are working.

Yes the R is above one, but thanks to the efforts of people of all ages in following the guidance and the rules the R is about half its natural rate.

And if we follow the guidance together and follow the rules then we can get it down.

And it is precisely because these measures are burdensome that from the beginning this government has provided unprecedented support to everyone in this country –  support worth £200bn to look after jobs and livelihoods and business.

And as we adjust our campaign to fight the virus it is right that we should now produce a new package of support across the country in addition to the specific agreements we have reached with Lancashire, Merseyside and others.

And because it is far, far better to keep business going now rather than to let those jobs go forever in a new national lockdown.

We will win this fight against Covid.

Because we can see that treatments are getting better, and medicines are getting better and testing technologies are getting better.

And we have shown before that we can drive the R down.

And in the meantime we need to protect jobs, protect livelihoods, and put the UK in strongest position for an economic recovery.

I am now going to hand over to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-10-22,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-october-2020"

Good evening and thank you for joining us for this Downing Street press conference.

First of all, I want to update you on the latest data in our fight against coronavirus. I can report through the Government’s ongoing testing and monitoring programme that, as of today:

1,921,770 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 100,490 tests carried out yesterday;
  223,060 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,877 cases since yesterday;
  11,401 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 11,768 the previous day.
  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 32,065 have now died. That’s an increase of 210 fatalities since yesterday. This figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.
Before we begin questions from the public and from the media I just want to remind people of a number of important things I said in my address to the nation last night.

First, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System. The COVID Alert Level has five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus. The level will be primarily determined by the R value and the number of coronavirus cases. In turn, that COVID Alert Level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place. The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures.

Throughout the period of lockdown which started on March 23rd we have been at Level 4 – meaning a Covid19 epidemic is in general circulation, and transmission is high or rising exponentially. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in steps.

And we have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life - but crucially while avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS.

After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.

Step 1 - from this week:

Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work.
  You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like.
  You can meet one person outside of your household outside (outdoors), provided you stay 2 metres apart. The social distancing measures remain absolutely crucial to us keeping the infection rate and the number of cases down as low as we possibly can.
Step 2 - from June 1, at the earliest, as long as the data allows, we aim to allow:

Primary schools to reopen for some pupils, in smaller class sizes;
  Non-essential retail to start to reopen, when and where it is safe to do so;
  Cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed doors, without crowds.
And then Step 3 – no earlier than July 4, and again, only if the data says it safe, we aim to allow:

More businesses and premises to open, including potentially those offering personal care such as leisure facilities, public places, and places of worship. Many of these businesses will need to operate in new ways to ensure they are safe, and we will work with these sectors on how to do this.

So, given we have taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures today, and therefore our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated our messaging. We are now asking people to Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives.

Yes - staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible. But there are a range of other actions we’re advising people to take as we modify measures.

People should Stay Alert, by:

working from home if you can;
  limiting contact with other people;
  keeping distance if you go out - 2 metres apart where possible;
  washing your hands regularly;
  wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant - for example in some shops and on public transport;
  and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate.
Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections. This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-05-11,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-11-may-2020"
"41","Speech","Coronavirus debate: opening speech","Speech by Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to open a debate in House of Commons on the coronavirus pandemic.","Madam Deputy Speaker,

The House meets today to debate the coronavirus pandemic once more.

The peril of this pandemic has no short-term quick fix, but calls for ingenuity, commitment and resolve from us all.

We have responded with one of the greatest collective efforts this nation has seen in peacetime.

But this fight is not yet over, and the virus continues to spread.

Cases, hospitalisations and, tragically, deaths are all rising.

Yesterday, we learned that Liverpool Hospital Trust is now treating more COVID patients than at the peak in April.

And across the UK, deaths have doubled in under a fortnight.

Strategy

And yet, just as the situation we face is grave, so the hope of a solution is growing.

And, with every day, my confidence in the ingenuity of science to bring resolution grows.

But until that moment, we must have resolve.

Madam Deputy Speaker, we are focused on finding a long-term solution. We reject political point-scoring.

And I call upon this House to work together in the interests of our whole nation – and indeed the whole world.

[political content removed]

Strategy and rebuttal

And so we need this long-term solution, and I would say, like other liberal democracies around the world, we are wrestling with this question, as we have just wrestled in the last few minutes, with the question of how we keep people safe from this virus whilst at the same time protecting the important things in life: our liberties, our livelihoods and the things that we love.

And that is what leads us to this strategy of suppressing the virus, supporting the economy, education and supporting the NHS to do all the things the NHS needs to do until a vaccine is available.

And I reject the false choice that says we must pick a side – and choose between a healthy economy and a healthy nation.

Because the 2 are intrinsically linked.

If we were to, God forbid, let the virus unleash its full force, then the damage – not just to the NHS and the hundreds of thousands of lives, but to our livelihoods too – would be catastrophic.

And we can only get our economy and our society going gangbusters again if we drive this virus down, so people have the confidence they need to live their lives to the full.

Long COVID

And drive it down we must. Now, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is a deadly virus and yes it reserves its biggest impact for the oldest in society, which means the rise in cases among the over 60s gives me such cause for concern.

And as we have just heard, compellingly, from the Minister for Equalities about the impact on people from ethnic minority backgrounds.

But the impact is not confined to these groups. The virus can affect anyone, of any age, and of any background.

And we have already seen worrying numbers of young, fit and healthy people suffering debilitating symptoms, months after contracting COVID.

Yesterday, a study by King’s College London showed that one in 20 people with coronavirus are likely to have virus symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness, muscle pain, and neurological problems for 8 weeks or more.

Yesterday I visited the cutting-edge long COVID clinic at University College London Hospital.

I met people in their 20s and 30s, unable to work, sapped of all their energy, living with the long-term effects of a virus that has completely changed their lives.

So to anyone, of any age, catching COVID can be very grave indeed.

Long COVID underpins, again, our strategy of suppressing the virus until a vaccine arrives.

[political content removed]

I now want, Madam Deputy Speaker, to turn to question of how we do that.

Social distancing

We cannot reiterate enough the importance of the basics: social distancing, and hands, face, space.

Local action

The next area, Madam Deputy Speaker, is through following the rules on local action, which is at the core of how we, and increasing numbers of other countries around the world, are tackling the crisis.

Through our local COVID alert levels we have been able to take a balanced approach.

And today I’d like to update the House on some further changes that we are making.

Unfortunately, we are seeing rising rates of infection in Stoke-on-Trent, Coventry and in Slough.

In all these areas, there are over 100 positive cases per 100,000 people.

Cases are doubling around every fortnight and we are seeing a concerning increase of cases among the over 60s.

So we have agreed, in partnership with local leaders, to move these areas into the high local alert level area, coming into force at one minute past midnight on Saturday.

The central change is that people cannot now meet other households socially indoors. This applies in any setting, at home, or in a restaurant, or any other venue.

The rule of 6 still applies to any outdoor setting.

And although you may continue to travel to open venues, you should reduce the number of journeys where possible.

I’d like to thank local leaders in these areas for the work that they’ve done, for their cooperation. And I can assure the people of Stoke-on-Trent, of Coventry and of Slough that we will support you all the way through, including with the business support that the Chancellor announced earlier today for all areas with a high local alert level.

We are also formally beginning discussions with Warrington about moving into the very high alert level, due to a continuing rise in cases there.

[political content removed]

The virus moves quickly and so we must respond quickly, and in a targeted way, like this, to keep it under control.

Local enforcement

As part of local discussions, Madam Deputy Speaker, local authorities including the LGA have asked for stronger enforcement powers.

And I agree.

To support businesses who are doing the right thing, it is fair that we take action against those businesses who are doing the wrong thing.

So firm enforcement helps make these restrictions fairer on all.

So we want to put in place stronger regulations to give local authorities further powers to take action in their local area.

The proposals we will bring forward will mean councils will be able to act without delay and use closure notices to shut premises on public health grounds, to help suppress the virus.

We will work with local authorities in the coming days on the detail of these proposals so we can act in a firm and fast way against the minority who are breaching these life-saving rules.

New testing and vaccines

Madam Deputy Speaker, these changes will help us fight this virus in the here and now.

But we are also making progress on long-term solutions.

The long-term solution is not to give up, as some would have us do or to wish the problem away.

It is to harness the science and ingenuity of innovation, whilst supporting people through.

First, if I can turn to testing.

Thanks to exceptional work from so many people, we have built a critical national infrastructure of diagnostic testing.

Today’s testing capacity is now over 370,000.

And alongside this expansion of the current technology, I want to update the House on mass testing.

Now I know there have been many questions about this project.

Last week we began rolling out new testing technologies to hospitals, based on the point-of-care LAMP test.

That will allow the regular, repeat, testing of NHS staff and patients.

And I am delighted to be able to tell the House that yesterday we began the roll-out of lateral flow tests to schools and universities.

Lateral flow tests don’t require a lab or a machine. The kit gives you the result within minutes.

We’ve successfully purchased many millions of these tests, and they’ll allow us both to find the virus where it spreads, and to reduce the disruption that virus control measures inevitably create.

If we can deliver a mass testing solution, so pupils in a bubble don’t have to isolate for a fortnight when one in the bubble tests positive, we will not only help control the spread of the virus, we will protect education better, and help schools, teachers and parents to live their lives much closer to normal.

These tests will also allow directors of public health to have more rapid access to testing capacity.

And we are starting the rollout to councils, including today with the council in Stoke-on-Trent.

Second, vaccines.

Progress continues on the development and deployment of vaccines.

And we are determined to give those developing vaccines all the support they need.

I can inform the House that we are initiating human challenge trials to speed up the development of a coronavirus vaccine.

And to improve further its safety.

We are contributing £33 million to back these trials, joining forces with academia and industry.

What a human challenge trial involves is taking a vaccine candidate that has proven to be safe in trials, and giving it to a carefully selected small number of healthy adult volunteers who are then exposed to the virus in a safe and controlled environment, closely monitored by medics and scientists.

And that gives us the chance to accelerate the understanding of promising vaccines that have been through clinical trials, so we can improve on their safe deployment.

And the UK is one of the only countries in the world with the capability to run this kind of programme.

And we should all be proud that once again we are leading this global effort.

Conclusion

Madam Deputy Speaker, our response to this lethal virus has been one of the greatest collective endeavours that this nation has ever seen.

And thanks to those efforts, we are so much better prepared this time round.

As a nation, we built the Nightingale hospitals in just 9 days.

As a nation, we came together as one to protect the NHS. And it wasn’t overwhelmed, and now the NHS is better yet prepared still.

As a nation, we built the biggest testing capability of all our peers.

And as a nation, we have made huge and historic advances in vaccines and treatments.

We understand this virus infinitely more than at the start at of this pandemic.

But we are not there yet.

Not when the virus is spreading at pace.

So we must, each of us, look at what we can do and the role we can play – what actions we can take.

Because as we have seen throughout this pandemic, we are at our best when we come together.

And we know that with science on our side, ultimately, we will prevail.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-10-22,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/coronavirus-debate-opening-speech"

Good afternoon,

Across the world, the countries most successful in their fight against coronavirus are adopting regional and local measures to protect their populations.

That is why last week we launched the three Local COVID Alert Levels for England, with interventions based on the prevalence of the virus in local areas.

Since then we have been undertaking discussions with local leaders in those parts of the country which are currently bearing the brunt of the second wave of this epidemic.

Before I update you on those discussions, I will ask Jonathan Van-Tam to brief us on the latest data nationally and in Greater Manchester.

Thank you very much JVT.

That presentation you’ve just seen shows you clearly why we must act.

Now I don’t want anyone to think their actions or efforts have been in vain.

Our collective action, across the country, has brought the R number well below its natural rate of about 3.

As a result, the virus is not spreading as quickly as it did in February and March.

However, while the R is below its natural level, it does remain above 1, meaning the virus continues to spread.

So, we need to take action to reduce the R and control the virus, especially in those parts of the country, as you’ve just seen, where the virus is most prevalent.

This evening, informed by the data we have just seen, I can announce that Greater Manchester will move to the Very High alert level.

This means that:

Pubs and bars must close, unless they are serving substantial meals.
  Households can’t mix indoors or in most outdoor settings.
  In some public outdoor spaces, groups must be limited to the rule of six.
  And we strongly advise against travel into and out of the area.
In line with the additional measures taken in Lancashire, casinos, bingo halls, betting shops, adult gaming centres and soft play areas must also close.

Regulations will be laid in Parliament on Thursday and come into force just after midnight.

I know that these restrictions are tough, both on businesses and individuals. And believe me no one wants to be putting these things into effect. But that is why we are putting in place a comprehensive package of support:

The Job Support Scheme ensures those affected by business closures are still paid. And once you top that up with Universal Credit, those on low incomes will receive at least 80% of their normal income.
  We have made available up to £465 million to help local authorities implement and enforce restrictions. Greater Manchester will receive £22 million of this.
  And that’s on top of the extra £1 billion of extra funding we are providing for all local authorities across the country.
  We will work with local authorities to allocate testing and introduce local contact tracing.
Over the last 10 days, we have sought to agree an approach with local leaders in Greater Manchester. Unfortunately, agreement wasn’t been reached.

And I do regret this. As I said last week, we would have a better chance of defeating the virus if we work together.

In addition I must say, to the support outlined above, we made a generous and extensive offer to support Manchester’s businesses. This offer was proportionate to the support we have given Merseyside and Lancashire, but the Mayor didn’t accept this unfortunately.

And given the public health situation, I must now proceed with moving Greater Manchester, as I say, to the Very High alert level.

Because not to act would put Manchester’s NHS, and the lives of many of Manchester’s residents, at risk.

Despite the failure to reach an agreement, I hope the Mayor and council leaders in Greater Manchester will now work with us to implement these measures.

Elsewhere, discussions on moving to the Very High alert level continue with local leaders in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and the North East.

I hope and expect central and local government will continue to work closely together, as we are seeing in Merseyside, Lancashire, London and many other parts of the country.

Because – ultimately – all of us want to protect the NHS, and in doing so to save lives.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-10-20,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-20-october-2020"

Coronavirus press conference 28 May 2020.

Good evening,

Before I set out our next steps in the fight against the coronavirus, let me update you on the latest data:

3,918,079 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 119,587 tests carried out yesterday;
  269,127 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,887 cases since yesterday;
  8,560 people are in hospital with coronavirus, down 11% from 9,607 this time last week.
  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 37,837 have now died. That’s an increase of 377 fatalities since yesterday and we are with their friends and family in mourning.
As you know, we have set five tests which must be met before adjusting the lockdown - as set out on the first slide.

It is vital that these tests are met before any changes are made, because we must not risk all the hard work and sacrifice of the British people.

At all times we are informed by the data and evidence, about the spread of the virus and the impact of the measures taken so far.

I will now take you through our latest assessment of progress against each of the five tests.

Next slide please.

Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.

At the start of the outbreak, there was significant concern that the NHS would not be able to cope. That turned out not to be the case, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone who works in the NHS. And the heroic efforts of the British people to contain this virus.

The data show that on 26 May, 475 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus - down from a peak of 3,121 on a single day, on 2 April.

On 27 May, 11% of mechanical ventilator beds in the UK were occupied by patients with coronavirus, down from a peak of 41% on 10 April.

This significant progress means we are meeting the first test.

Can I have the next slide please.

Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.

As measured by a seven-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 256, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.

While every death is one too many, it is now the case that there has been a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, and so the second test is being met.

Next slide please.

Our third test is to receive reliable information, reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection - the number of people catching Covid - is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.

And in the last seven days, an average of 2,312 new cases were confirmed with a positive test, that’s down from a peak of 5,066 in the first week of May.

Based on the various data available, the Government is satisfied that the third test is being met.

And in a moment, Sir Patrick will tell us more about other methods of measuring infections, including the R number.

Next slide please.

Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.

I fully acknowledge the difficulties on testing and PPE that we have faced since the start of the outbreak. It has been immensely frustrating, but we are now making progress.

Yesterday we carried out 119,587 tests, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. Testing capacity has now increased to 161,214 a day.

We have now signed over 100 new deals with PPE suppliers around the world. Here in the UK, thanks to the efforts of Lord Deighton and his team and the brilliance of domestic manufacturers we have signed contracts for over two billion items of PPE, including facemasks, visors, gowns and aprons.

We are therefore satisfied that the fourth test is being met and we can start to rebuild stocks - though we recognise there may be some settings that require urgent restocking on occasion.

Can I have the next slide please.

Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS.

I am very grateful to the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their assessments of the measures I am about to set out on schools, retail and social contact. Although all parts of the UK are moving in the same direction, it is important to note health is devolved and different parts of the UK are quite properly all moving at different speeds.

This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious.

It is thanks to the caution we have shown so far that all five tests are being met. That is not my achievement or the government’s achievement - it is your achievement, only possible thanks to your resolve and dedication to our national purpose to overcome this virus.

So the result is we can move forward with adjusting the lockdown in England on Monday.

Firstly, as I set out on Sunday, we will now reopen schools to more children. Closing schools has deprived children of their education, and as so often it is the most disadvantaged pupils who risk being hardest hit.

On Monday we will start to put this right - in a safe way - by reopening nurseries and other early years settings and reception, year one and year six in primary schools.

A fortnight later on 15 June, secondary schools will begin to provide some face-to-face contact time for years 10 and 12.

Secondly, we will also start to reopen shops as we restart our economy.

We will begin, on Monday, with outdoor retail and car showrooms, where social distancing is generally easier.

And a fortnight later on 15 June, we intend to reopen other non-essential retail - but only provided the five tests are still being met and shops have been made Covid secure.

Lastly, I know the toll that lockdown has taken on families and friends who have been unable to see each other.

So from Monday we will allow up to six people to meet outside - provided those from different households continue strictly to observe social distancing rules by staying two metres apart.

At the moment, as you know, people can meet in parks but not in private gardens. This was a cautious first step - but we know that there is no difference in the health risk. So we will now allow people to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces.

These changes mean friends and family can start to meet their loved ones - perhaps seeing both parents at once, or both grandparents at once. I know that for many this will be a long-awaited and joyful moment.

But I must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with.

Minimising contact with others is still the best way to prevent transmission. You should also try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession - so that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus.

And it remains the case that people should not be inside the homes of their friends and families, unless it is to access the garden.

I should add that, at this stage, I am afraid that those who have been asked to shield themselves should continue to do so.

I want to say to those extremely clinically vulnerable people who are being shielded that I do understand how difficult this has been for you, especially. And I want to thank you for all the efforts you have gone to - because your actions have helped the NHS to cope.

We are looking carefully at how we can make your life easier, and how we can better support you, and we want to say more on that soon.

I want to reassure everyone that we can make all of the changes I have outlined in a safe way.

We know that children, and particularly young children, are much less likely to be seriously affected by the virus.

We know that if shops enforce social distancing, as required by our Covid secure guidelines, then the virus is less likely to spread.

And crucially, we know that transmission of the virus is far lower outdoors, so we can confidently allow more interaction outside.

I understand people will have questions as to how to do all of this safely - and we will publish guidance on these changes to help people, to help you, make the most of them.

Now inevitably, there may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules. And clearly what we’re proposing is still just a fraction of the social interaction each of us would normally enjoy.

I know many of you will find this frustrating - I am sorry about that. But I’m afraid it is unavoidable, given the nature of the invisible enemy we are fighting.

It is a complex problem and we are asking for everyone’s patience as we work through it together. We will inevitably not get everything right first time.

But I must ask everyone to remember it is that same patience, the hard work, and sacrifices of the British people in lockdown that have got us so far and allow us to make the progress we have.

By protecting the NHS, getting us through the peak, and getting the virus under control - we are able to deliver all of the adjustments and easing of restrictions I have set out today.

These adjustments are most of those we set out to achieve in step two of our roadmap, and we have also been able to have them in place by June 1 as we had hoped.

There is no doubt that we are making progress and I am hopeful that in the coming weeks we may be able to do more.

Because obviously while protecting the health and safety of the British public is, and must always be, our number one priority, we must also work to restart our economy and society - so as many people as possible can begin returning to their way of life.

But I want to reaffirm that fundamental commitment to the British people that all the steps we have taken, and will take, are conditional.

They are conditional on all the data, and all the scientific advice, and it is that scientific advice which will help us to judge what we are doing is safe.

And I have to warn you, there will be further local outbreaks. So we will monitor carefully, we will put on the brakes as required, and where necessary, we will re-impose measures. It’s important to be clear about that up front.

And as before, we will see how these new changes are working, and look at the R value and the number of new infections before taking any further steps, so we can ensure anything we do does not risk a second peak that could overwhelm the NHS.

And yesterday, as I hope you all know, we took a huge step forward that will enable us to keep making progress in returning our lives to as close to normal as possible, while continuing to control the virus and isolate any new outbreaks.

And that is through our new NHS Test and Trace programme in England. The Scottish Government has established Test and Protect, and Welsh and Northern Irish schemes will follow next week.

And I’ll now show a short video that explains how NHS Test and Trace works in England and what we all need to do to play our part.

Now I’ll hand over to Sir Patrick.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-05-28,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-on-the-five-tests-28-may-2020"

Good evening,

I am delighted to be joined today by the Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and by Professor Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford’s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health.

Today I’m actually going to let them do most of the talking as they have some news to share on a new treatment for coronavirus.

But I’ll start by updating you briefly on the latest data.

Can I have the first slide please?


    6,981,493 tests for coronavirus carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 113,107 carried out or posted out yesterday.
  
  
    298,136 have tested positive, an increase of 1,279 cases since yesterday.
  
The second slide shows the latest data from hospitals:


    410 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 13 June, that’s down from 438 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April.
  
  
    385 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 513 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.
  
The third slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country:

There are now 5,254 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 16% from 6,282 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,698 on 12 April.
The fourth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus:

And across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 41,969. That’s an increase of 233 fatalities since yesterday.
Although those figures are very sad, they do show that we are making good progress in controlling the spread of the virus.

Tests are up and cases are down.

Hospital admissions are down.

The numbers of patients in hospital overall - and specifically those on mechanical ventilation beds - are both down.

And of course while each death is one too many, deaths are coming down too.

That progress of course has only been possible thanks to the dedication of the British people as we work together to beat this virus.

By observing the lockdown, and sacrificing contact with friends and families, everybody has played their part in bringing the virus under control.

It is critical now that we hold our nerve – and we don’t throw away the progress we have made.

On the 11 May I set out our plan to help our country recover and we are working through it, carefully and deliberately.

At each stage we have only proceeded when the evidence suggests it is safe to do so, ensuring our five tests for adjusting the lockdown continue to be met.

And yesterday it was great to see our shops open their doors again. Our retail sector has done a fantastic job to make sure they are Covid Secure, meaning they can open in a safe way for staff and for customers.

It is great to see so many people out shopping whilst observing social distancing – and that is so important to limiting the spread of the virus.

It has also been very good to see more, and more children back at school this week, with some secondary pupils returning for face-to-face contact with their teachers ahead of the exams next year.

And I want to say to all parents whose children are eligible to return to school, I want to assure you it is safe – and there is no need for your kids to miss out on their education, I hope they will go to school.

I know that people want us to go further – with our changes to social distancing measures and I am all too aware the 2 metre rule has big implications for schools and many other sectors, and I absolutely hear those concerns and will do everything in my power to get us back to normal as soon possible.

But we must proceed carefully, and according to our plan. I am still committed to the central goal to get back to life as close to normal as possible, for as many people as possible, as fast and fairly as possible… and in a way that minimises the risk of a new epidemic, minimises the risk to life and maximises our chances of a string economic and social recovery.

Our plan sets out that the next step of adjusting lockdown - for personal care, for the hospitality and leisure sector, for gatherings in places of worship and other public places – a lot more to come and that as you know will happen no sooner than 4 July.

I remain committed to that plan, and will say more soon about how we intend to take it forward.

Today, the global efforts to find a long-term solution to the pandemic continue, through a vaccine or effective treatment.

And I am delighted that the biggest breakthrough yet has been made by a fantastic team of scientists right here in the UK.

I am not really qualified to announce on this drug and its effects but I will ask Sir Patrick and Professor Horby to say more in a moment.

But I am so proud of these British scientists, backed by UK Government funding, who have led the first robust clinical trial anywhere in the world to find a coronavirus treatment proven to reduce the risk of death.

And I am very grateful to the thousands of patients in this country who volunteered for the trials – thank you.

This drug - dexamethasone – can now be made available across the NHS. And we have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak.

Of course, while the chances of dying from Covid-19 have been significantly reduced by this treatment, they are still far too high. So we must redouble our research efforts and we certainly will.

But today, there is genuine cause to celebrate a great, British achievement and the benefits it will bring not just in this country but around the world.

I’ll now hand over to Sir Patrick.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-06-16,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-coronavirus-press-conference-16-june-2020"
"45","Speech","Prime Minister's statement to the House on COVID-19: 23 June 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement to the House on coronavirus.","Mr Speaker, before I begin, I am sure the whole House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to the families and friends of

James Furlong, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and David Wails,

who were brutally killed in Reading on Saturday.

To assault defenceless people in a park is not simply an act of wickedness but abject cowardice,

and we will never yield to those who would seek to destroy our way of life.

Mr Speaker, with permission I will update the House on the next steps in our plan to rebuild our economy and reopen our society,

while waging our struggle against Covid-19.

From the outset, we have trusted in the common sense and perseverance of the British people

and their response has more than justified our faith.

Since I set out our plan on the 11th May,

we have been clear that our cautious relaxation of the guidance is entirely conditional on our continued defeat of the virus.

In the first half of May, nearly 69,000 people tested positive for Covid-19 across the UK;

by the first half of June, that total had fallen by nearly 70 percent to just under 22,000.

The number of new infections is now declining by between 2 and 4 percent every day.

Four weeks ago, an average of 1 in 400 people in the community in England had COVID-19;

in the first half of June, this figure was 1 in 1,700.

We created a human shield around the NHS and in turn our doctors and nurses have protected us,

and together we have saved our hospitals from being overwhelmed.

On the 11th May, 1,073 people were admitted to hospital in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with Covid-19,

by 20th June, this had fallen by 74 per cent to 283.

This pandemic has inflicted permanent scars and we mourn everyone we have lost.

Measured by a seven-day rolling average, the number of daily deaths peaked at 943 on the 14th April,

on 11th May it was 476,

and yesterday, the rolling average stood at 130.

We have ordered over 2.2 billion items of protective equipment from UK based manufacturers, many of whose production lines have been called into being to serve this new demand -

and yesterday, we conducted or posted 139,659 tests, bringing the total to over 8 million.

And while we remain vigilant, we do not believe there is currently a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS.

Taking everything together, we continue to meet our five tests

and the Chief Medical Officers of all four home nations have downgraded the UK’s Covid Alert Level from four to three,

meaning that we no longer face a virus spreading exponentially,

though it remains in general circulation.

The administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland hold responsibility for their own lockdown restrictions

and they will respond to the united view of the Chief Medical Officers at their own pace, based on their own judgment,

but all parts of the UK are now travelling in the same direction and we will continue to work together to ensure that everyone in our country gets the support they need.

Thanks to our progress, we can now go further and safely ease the lockdown in England.

At every stage, caution will remain our watchword, and each step will be conditional and reversible.

Mr Speaker, given the significant fall in the prevalence of the virus, we can change the two-metre social distancing rule, from 4th July.

I know this rule effectively makes life impossible for large parts of our economy, even without other restrictions.

For example, it prevents all but a fraction of our hospitality industry from operating.

So that is why almost two weeks ago, I asked our experts to conduct a review and I will place a summary of their conclusions in the libraries of both Houses this week.

Where it is possible to keep 2 metres apart people should.

But where it is not, we will advise people to keep a social distance of ‘one metre plus’,

meaning they should remain one metre apart, while taking mitigations to reduce the risk of transmission.

We are today publishing guidance on how businesses can reduce the risk by taking certain steps to protect workers and customers.

These include, for instance, avoiding face-to-face seating by changing office layouts,

reducing the number of people in enclosed spaces,

improving ventilation,

using protective screens and face coverings,

closing non-essential social spaces,

providing hand sanitiser

and changing shift patterns so that staff work in set teams.

And of course, we already mandate face coverings on public transport.

Whilst the experts cannot give a precise assessment of how much the risk is reduced,

they judge these mitigations would make “1 metre plus” broadly equivalent to the risk at 2 metres if those mitigations are fully implemented.

Either will be acceptable and our guidance will change accordingly.

This vital change enables the next stage of our plan to ease the lockdown.

Mr Speaker, I am acutely conscious people will ask legitimate questions about why certain activities are allowed and others are not.

I must ask the House to understand that the virus has no interest in these debates.

Its only interest, its only ambition is to exploit any opportunities is to recapture ground that we might carelessly vacate.

There is one certainty: the fewer social contacts you have, the safer you will be.

My duty, our duty as the Government, is to guide the British people, balancing our overriding aim of controlling the virus against our natural desire to bring back normal life.

We cannot lift all the restrictions at once, so we have to make difficult judgments,

and every step is scrupulously weighed against the evidence.

Our principle is to trust the British public to use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks,

remembering that the more we open up, the more vigilant we will need to be.

From now on we will ask people to follow guidance on social contact instead of legislation.

In that spirit we advise that from 4 July, two households of any size should be able to meet in any setting inside or out.

That does not mean they must always be the same two households.

It will be possible for instance to meet one set of grandparents one weekend, and the others the following weekend.

We are not recommending meetings of multiple households indoors because of the risk of creating greater chains of transmission.

Outside, the guidance remains that people from several households can meet in groups of up to six.

and it follows that two households can also meet, regardless of size.

Mr Speaker, I can tell the House that we will also re-open restaurants and pubs.

All hospitality indoors will be limited to table-service, and our guidance will encourage minimal staff and customer contact.

We will ask businesses to help NHS Test and Trace respond to any local outbreaks

by collecting contact details from customers, as happens in other countries,

and we will work with the sector to make this manageable.

Almost as eagerly awaited as a pint will be a haircut, particularly by me,

and so we will re-open hairdressers, with appropriate precautions, including the use of visors.

We also intend to allow some other close contact services, such as nail bars, to re-open as soon as we can, when we are confident they can operate in a Covid-secure way.

From 4th July, provided that no more than two households stay together,

people will be free to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation,

including hotels and bed & breakfasts,

as well as campsites as long as shared facilities are kept clean.

Most leisure facilities and tourist attractions will reopen if they can do so safely,

including outdoor gyms and playgrounds, cinemas, museums, galleries, theme parks and arcades

as well as libraries, social clubs and community centres.

“Close proximity” venues such as nightclubs, soft-play areas, indoor gyms, swimming pools and spas will need to remain closed for now, as will bowling alleys and water parks.

But my RHFs the Business and Culture Secretaries will establish taskforces with public health experts and these sectors to help them become Covid-secure and re-open as soon as possible.

We will also work with the arts industry on specific guidance to enable choirs, orchestras and theatres to resume live performances as soon as possible.

Recreation and sport will be allowed, but indoor facilities, including changing rooms and courts, will remain closed

and people should only play close contact team sports with members of their household.

Mr Speaker, I know that many have mourned the closure of places of worship,

and this year, Easter, Passover and Eid all occurred during the lockdown.

So I am delighted that places of worship will be able to reopen for prayer and services –

including weddings with a maximum of 30 people,

all subject to social distancing.

Meanwhile, our courts, probation services, police stations and other public services will increasingly resume face-to-face proceedings.

Wrap-around care for school age children and formal childcare will restart over the summer.

Primary and secondary education will recommence in September with full attendance

and those children who can already go to school should do so – because it is safe.

Mr Speaker, we will publish Covid-secure guidelines for every sector that is re-opening,

and slowly but surely, these measures will restore a sense of normality.

After the toughest restrictions in peacetime history,

we are now able to make life easier for people to see more of their friends and families

and to help businesses get back on their feet and get people back into work.

But the virus has not gone away.

We will continue to monitor the data with the Joint Biosecurity Centre and our ever more effective Test and Trace system.

And I must be clear to the House, that as we have seen in other countries,

there will be flare-ups for which local measures will be needed

and we will not hesitate to apply the brakes and re-introduce restrictions even at national level - if required.

So I urge everyone to stay alert, control the virus and save lives.

Let’s keep washing our hands,

staying 2 metres apart wherever feasible, and mitigating the risks at 1 metre where not,

avoiding public transport when possible, and wearing a mask when not,

getting tested immediately if we have symptoms,

and self-isolating if instructed by NHS Test and Trace.

Today, we can say that our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end

and life is returning to our shops, streets and homes

and a new, but cautious, optimism is palpable.

But it would be all too easy for that frost to return

and that is why we will continue to trust in the common sense and the community spirit of the British people to follow this guidance,

to carry us through and see us to victory over this virus.

I commend Mr Speaker this Statement to the House.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-06-23,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-on-covid-19-23-june-2020"
"46","Speech","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 July 2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement on coronavirus.","Good evening,

Since I last spoke to you from this podium, we have continued to make progress nationally against the virus.

We are now reporting regularly fewer than 1,000 new cases each day.

The Office for National Statistics estimates that between 14 June and 27 June, the most recent period they have analysed, 25,000 people in the community in England had the virus – 1 person in every 2,200.

SAGE assess that the R rate – the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto – remains between 0.7 and 0.9 across the UK.

SAGE also assess that, in England, the number of new infections is shrinking by between 2 and 5% every day.

And while the number of people dying with coronavirus remains too high, the numbers do continue to fall.

Now of course this picture is not universal. There are areas – such as Leicester – where the virus is still more prevalent than we would like.

We always said there would be local outbreaks requiring local action. This is to be expected and will, I’m afraid, be a feature of our lives for some time to come.

But that should not take away from the great progress we have made, together, as a country against this vicious disease.

This progress is the reason why we have been able – slowly, carefully, cautiously – to ease the national lockdown.

Without doubt, lockdown has saved many hundreds of thousands of lives – but it has also had a devastating impact on our way of life and our economy.

And of course, lockdown has not yet been lifted entirely.

Indoor gyms, nail bars and swimming pools are still closed, mass gatherings are still prohibited, social distancing is still essential.

I want these restrictions to be lifted as soon as possible – of course I do.

We have established taskforces to work rapidly and closely with the sectors that remain closed to explore how they can be Covid Secure. I am pleased to report good progress is being made.

Next week we will set out a timetable for their re-opening – though of course I can only lift those remaining, national restrictions as and when it is safe to do so.

Our goal remains to enable as many people as possible to live their lives as close to normally as possible – in a way which is as fair and as safe as possible.

To achieve this we need to move away from blanket, national measures, to targeted, local measures.

So instead of locking down the whole country, we will lock down specific premises or local areas where the virus is spreading.

Instead of closing down non-essential retail and hospitality nationwide, we will only shut establishments locally as required.

Instead of shutting all schools for most pupils, from September we will only shut those schools where it is absolutely necessary to control an outbreak.

And instead of quarantining arrivals from the whole world, we will only quarantine arrivals from those countries where the virus is, sadly, not yet under control.

We are already implementing this targeted approach in England.

In Weston-Super-Mare, we identified an outbreak in a hospital, closed it to visitors and new admissions, tested all staff and patients and gave the hospital a deep clean. The outbreak was contained and the hospital is open again.

In Kirklees, we identified an outbreak at a meat packing plant, shut down the plant, moved in a mobile testing unit, tested all employees and traced the contacts of those who were positive. The outbreak was contained and the plant has reopened with additional safety measures in place.

And of course more recently in Leicester, we identified a community-wide outbreak which was not restricted to a single location, unlike Weston-Super-Mare and Kirklees. Public Health England engaged with the local authority, mobile testing units were deployed, full data was shared – council-wide data was shared on 11 June, and postcode-level data was shared last week.

This enhanced monitoring through additional testing showed that the infection rate in Leicester was three times the next highest infection rate in any other city in the country. So on Monday, the Health Secretary announced local lockdown measures in Leicester for an initial period of 2 weeks.

In each of these cases, the problems identified were specific to Weston-Super-Mare, Kirklees and Leicester. So of course it made sense to take action locally, rather than re-impose restrictions on the whole country.

And we are learning the whole time. With each local outbreak, we see what works well and what not so well, so that we do better next time.

Informed by our experience of these cases, we have developed an approach for controlling future local outbreaks which has five principle components: monitoring, engagement, testing, targeted restrictions and finally, as a last resort, lockdown.

First, monitoring. Public Health England, working with the Joint Biosecurity Centre, will examine carefully data on the spread of the disease and people’s behaviour across the country. They will look out for emerging trends, rising case numbers and other indicators, while taking into account local factors. Critically, we have made local data available to all Directors of Public Health in local authorities, so they too can monitor what is happening in their area. And local data will also be available to the public on the gov.uk dashboard.

Second, engagement. If monitoring identifies local problems, NHS Test and Trace and PHE will work with the relevant local authority to develop a deeper understanding of the problem and identify solutions. Working with local agencies, we will seek to keep the local community informed at every stage, so they know what is happening and what actions, if any, they need to take.

Third, testing. We now have substantial testing capacity nationwide and we have the ability to target that capacity at local areas in order to get a grip on emerging outbreaks. Scaled-up testing at a local level, combined with contract tracing through NHS Test and Trace, can control the virus and thus avoid more stringent measures.

Fourth, targeted restrictions. If the virus continues to spread, we will restrict activities at particular locations and close individual premises. As in Weston-Super-Mare and Kirklees, we will restrict access to places which become hotspots for the virus, while testing people who have spent time in those places, and tracing the contacts of anyone who tests positive.

Fifth, local lockdown. If the previous measures have not proven to be enough, we will introduce local lockdowns extending across whole communities. As in Leicester, that could mean shutting businesses venues that would otherwise be open, closing schools or urging people once more to stay at home. Local lockdowns will be carefully calibrated depending on the scientific and specific circumstances of each outbreak and we are continually exploring smarter means of containing the virus.

So that is the approach we will take as local outbreaks occur and we will set out more detail soon.

Let me end by looking forward to this weekend.

Tomorrow, there will be a moment of remembrance for those whose lives have tragically been lost before their time.

And at 5pm on Sunday, the NHS’s 72nd birthday, we can all come together to clap those who have worked tirelessly and selflessly to help the nation get through this pandemic.

I know everyone will be looking forward to the relaxation of national restrictions. As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.

They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, B&Bs, indeed much of our tourism industry.

All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.

But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.

Lockdown only succeeded in controlling the virus because everyone worked together, and we will only succeed in reopening if everyone works together again. Because we are not out of the woods yet. The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that. If it starts running out of control again this Government will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re-imposing restrictions.

Anyone who flouts social distancing and COVID-Secure rules is not only putting us all at risk but letting down those businesses and workers who have done so much to prepare for this new normal.

So as we take this next step, our biggest step yet, on the road to recovery, I urge the British people to do so safely.

Remember – don’t gather in groups of more than 6 outside or 2 households in any setting.

Keep your distance from those outside your household – 2 metres if you can, 1 metre with precautions if you can’t.

Wash your hands.

Let’s all stay alert, control the virus, save lives – and enjoy summer safely.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-07-03,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-3-july-2020"

Good afternoon. I am joined today by Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England

The average number of new cases each day is now 22,524, compared to 22,398 a week ago.

There are now 14,196 COVID-19 patients in hospital across the UK, compared to 12,406 a week ago.

1,219 patients are now in mechanical ventilation beds, compared to 1,142 a week ago.

And, sadly, another 595 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported yesterday.

The 7 day average daily number of deaths each day in the UK within 28 days of positive test by date reported is now 375, up from 295 a week ago.

Our thoughts are very much with the families and loved ones of those who’ve lost their lives.

Which is a reminder to us, as to why we are taking the action we are, to stop the spread of this virus and ultimately save lives.

Today, we are also reminded about the vital importance of fighting this virus to protect our economy.

Whilst the economy grew by 15% in the third quarter, it slowed in September and remains 8.2% below where we were in February.

We in government understand acutely the human impact this statistic represents.

It’s jobs, livelihoods, and families affected.

So we will continue to support businesses now, and as they recover.

The government has provided unprecedented levels of support for businesses over the past 8 months.

To date, that represents over £200 billion in support.

This is one of the most generous and comprehensive packages of financial support provided in the world, which the International Monetary Fund has praised.

Just this month we have announced an extension of the self-employed grant scheme to March next year.

An extension of the furlough scheme, at 80% until the spring.

Cash grants of up to £3,000 per month for businesses in England, which are required to be closed due to this month’s national restrictions.

These will benefit 600,000 business premises.

And I can confirm today that we will be distributing £2.2 billion to local authorities tomorrow, to allow them to make these vital grant payments to businesses which have been affected.

All of these measures are designed to preserve jobs and help businesses stay afloat.

Today, we have also announced that more than 19,000 jobs have been created so far through our Kickstart Scheme.

These jobs are spread across the country and in a variety of sectors.

I know how hard this job market is, particularly for young job seekers, hoping to enter the workplace for the first time.

The Kickstart Scheme is a ray of hope for young people, and I want to thank all the businesses which have stepped up to participate in this scheme.

I speak to businesses everyday, and I can see, that despite the tough times, they are determined to soldier through this.

Through sheer hard work, innovation, resilience and invoking a real community spirit across the United Kingdom.

For example, in Aberdeenshire, Brewdog has made hand sanitiser to protect our front-line NHS staff.

In Belfast, Axial3D has helped to develop thousands of new ventilators.

In Surrey, Carousel Lights have adapted their manufacturing process to produce ‘sneeze screens’ for GP surgeries, pharmacies, and care homes.

In Caerphilly, Transcend Packaging has converted production lines to create PPE, almost doubling their workforce in just four months.

Because, despite the government’s support, and when it comes down to it, it is you who are keeping this country going.

You who are powering our economic recovery.

Just as our brilliant scientists and researchers are powering ahead in the race to discover a safe and effective vaccine.

A little over 6 months ago, I stood here and announced the creation of the Vaccines Taskforce.

A team of industry experts, scientists and civil servants, with one mission: to secure a vaccine to beat down this virus.

Since then, they have secured access to 350 million doses, through agreements on 6 of the leading candidates in the world.

The Taskforce has demonstrated how we can work together at pace.

Business and science, the NHS and local communities, together forging a path out of this predicament.

But, although this week’s announcement on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is potentially very good news, we still have a lot of hurdles to overcome before we can be certain of its safety and efficacy.

And so we must ensure that we continue to follow the guidance.

To protect our loved ones, our families, our friends, our communities.

Because the virus is still here. It is still a danger.

So we must not lose our resolve now.

We must keep focused.

To protect the health of the nation and the health of the economy.

Working together, supporting each other, we will get through this.

We will come out the other side stronger, more resilient and more united.

Thank you.","Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England, Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP",2020-11-12,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-12-november-2020"

Coronavirus press conference 30 March 2020.

Good afternoon, welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press briefing. I’m joined by our Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance and Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England.

Before Sir Patrick provides an update on the latest data from our COBR coronavirus dashboard, I just want to give you an update on the steps that we as a government are taking to defeat coronavirus.

Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, thereby protecting the NHS’ capacity. At each point we have been following the scientific and medical advice and we’ve been very deliberate in our actions - taking the right steps at the right moment.

We are also taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the numbers of beds, key staff, life-saving equipment on the frontline so that we give people the care they need when they need it most.

That’s why we are instructing people to stay at home, so we can protect our NHS and save lives.

I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:


    134,946 people have now been tested for the virus
  
  
    112,805 have tested negative
  
  
    22,141 have tested positive
  
Of those who have contracted the virus, 1,408 have, very sadly, died. We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who have passed away and I think those figures are a powerful reminder to us all of the importance of following the government’s guidelines.

We must stay at home to protect our NHS and save lives.

I would like to thank all those involved on the frontline and in particular all of those in the NHS for their battle against the virus,  the amazing doctors, the amazing nurses and all the support staff working day and night.

The thousands of other key workers – from our teachers to supermarket workers to our fantastic diplomatic network – who are all as a team working around the clock to get us through this unprecedented coronavirus challenge.

This is a united national effort and the spirit of selflessness shown by so many is an inspiration.

I now want to turn to what we’ve been doing to support British people travelling around the world.

Coronavirus hasn’t just challenged us at home, it is the greatest global challenge in a generation. And as countries work to secure their borders and stop the further spread of this deadly virus, we appreciate that an unprecedented number of UK travellers are trying to get home, and we’re not talking a few hundred or even a few thousand. We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of people travelling around the world.

So with that in mind, on 17 March, we advised people against all non-essential travel around the world.

And since 23 March, we have advised that all UK residents who were currently travelling abroad should return home. Hundreds of thousands have already done so.

But many travellers haven’t yet managed to get home. From young back-packers to retired couples on cruises. We appreciate the difficult predicament that they find themselves in.

We also recognise the anxiety of families here in the UK, who are concerned to get their loved ones home. It is a worrying time for all those who have been affected.

And I want to reassure them that this government, their government is working around the clock to support, advise and help British travellers get home.

I have spoken to more than 20 foreign ministers around the world in the last week or so to support this effort, to keep airports and ports open, and to facilitate access to them by British travellers.

Over the weekend, I spoke to foreign ministers from Australia, New Zealand, India and Brazil and Pakistan, and I also spoke to the Ethiopian Prime Minister, and in all of those cases urged them to work with us and keep commercial routes flying.

Given the scale and the complexity of this challenge, it inevitably requires a team effort. So the Foreign Office is working with other governments, and there is a particular focus on transit hubs, and we’re also working with the airlines to keep as many flights running as possible.

We have a lot more to do, but we have already helped hundreds of thousands of Britons get home.

The first priority has been to keep as many commercial flights running as we can, and that’s based on just purely the scale and the number of people who want to come home.

As a result of those efforts, and the cooperation we received from the Spanish government, we’ve enabled an estimated 150,000 UK nationals to get back from Spain. On other commercial routes that have come under pressure, we’ve worked with partner governments and airlines to get back 8,500 UK travellers back from Morocco and around 5,000 UK nationals from Cyprus.

That gives you a sense of the scale of the challenge and the numbers of British travellers abroad.

Now in circumstances where commercial flights can’t operate, we have already chartered flights, which proved necessary to return 1,400 UK nationals on flights, for example, from China at the outset of this crisis and more recently from Peru.

We’ve not faced challenges in getting people home from abroad, on this scale, in recent memory. Airports are closing down or preventing airlines from operating on a commercial basis. Local authorities have placed restrictions on movement that prevent people from getting to the airport. And the critical transit hubs that we rely on for long-haul flights are also shutting down, or in some cases,  limiting their flights.

Some of these restrictions have been done with very little notice, some with no notice at all which makes it very difficult to respond. So, international collaboration is absolutely vital.

As I said, it is a team effort, in it involves government working with other governments and also with the airlines.

So with that in mind, I can today announce a new arrangement between the government and airlines to fly home tens of thousands of stranded British travellers, where commercial flights are no longer possible. Partner airlines include British Airways, Virgin, Easyjet, Jet2 and Titan, and this list can be expanded.

Under the arrangements that we are putting in place, we will target flights from a range of priority countries, starting this week.

Let me explain a little bit about how this will work in practise.

Where commercial routes remain an option, airlines will be responsible for getting passengers home. That means offering alternative flights at little to no cost where routes have been cancelled. And it means allowing passengers to change tickets, including between carriers.

So for those still in those in countries where commercial options are still available, don’t wait. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded. The airlines are standing by to help you. Please book your tickets as soon as possible.

Where commercial flights are no longer running, the government will provide the necessary financial support for special charter flights to bring UK nationals back home. Once special charter flights have been arranged, we will promote flights them through the government’s travel advice and by the British Embassy or High Commission in the relevant country.

British travellers who want a seat on those flight will book and pay directly through a dedicated travel management company.

We designated £75 million to support those flights and airlines to keep costs down and affordable for those seeking to return to the UK.

In arranging these flights, our priority will be the most vulnerable, including the elderly or those with particularly pressing medical needs, and also looking in particular at countries where large numbers of UK tourists struggling to get home.

UK travellers, if they haven’t already done so, should check Foreign Office Travel Advice and that advice is under constant review, and it can help travellers to find out more details of how to access the flights under this arrangement.

They should also follow the social media of the UK embassy or high commission in the country where they find themselves, so that they can be directed to accurate real time information, including from the local authorities.

For any questions that can’t be answered in that travel advice, or by the UK Embassies or High Commission, we also have our call centre working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

I know that it has been difficult for some travellers to get through. Just to give you a sense of volume: on average, we normally receive 1,000 calls a day to that call centre.  Last Tuesday, we had nearly 15,000 – the highest on record.

So we’ve boosted our resources, we’ve redeployed people to assist in the call centre and we’ve tripled our capacity.

Yesterday, the call centre answered 99% of calls, and helped thousands of British travellers to get the answers they need.

So, for those stranded, or for families nervously waiting news and wanting to see their loved ones return home, we are doing everything we can. We have improved our advice and boosted the call centre, so travellers get better and swifter information.

We have put in place this arrangement with the airlines so that we can reach British citizens in vulnerable circumstances abroad where commercial flights aren’t running. And we’re working intensively round the clock with all of our partner countries and governments around the world to keep open the airports, the ports and the flights to bring people home.

We’ve not faced an international challenge quite like this before, but together we are going to rise to it.

And, of course here at home, we can all support our NHS by continuing to follow the guidance to:

stay at home
  protect our NHS
  and save lives

Good evening,

Could I have the first slide please?

On 16 April, we set out our five tests for adjusting the lockdown, and since then they have guided our path out of lockdown.

At every stage, we have diligently assessed our progress against these five tests before making changes.

It has meant that we have, so far, avoided the catastrophe of a second peak of infection that could have overwhelmed the NHS and meant so many more lives lost.

Next slide please.

Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.

Well, the NHS has coped fantastically under the extraordinary pressure of this extraordinary pandemic.

On 20 June, 283 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - down from 438 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April.

And on 22 June, 340 patients with coronavirus were in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 513 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.

These numbers provide confidence that we are still meeting the first test.

Next slide please.

Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so that we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.

Of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, it saddens me to report that 42,927 have now died. 171 fatalities were reported in the 24 hours to 5pm yesterday. A further 109 deaths which occurred in April, May and June have been identified and added to the total.

As measured by a 7-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 121, down from 216 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.

The second test is, therefore, still being met.

Next slide please.

Our third test is to receive reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.

In total, 306,210 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, which is an increase of 874 cases since yesterday.

The seven day rolling average of new positive cases is now 1,147, down from 1,543 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 5,195 on 14 April.

Approximately one in 1,700 people in the community in England are now estimated to have the virus, down from 1 in 400 four weeks ago. SAGE believes infections across the UK are shrinking at a steady rate of between 4 and 2 per cent every day.

Based on all the various data available, the government is confident the third test is being met.

Next slide please.

Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.

Yesterday 237,142 tests were carried out or posted out across the UK, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April.

The new NHS Test and Trace service has already advised over 87,000 people to self-isolate who might otherwise have unwittingly transmitted the virus.

We have contracted with over 175 new suppliers able to deliver PPE at the scale and pace the UK requires.

And this progress means we are satisfied that the fourth test is being met.

Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS.

I am once again grateful for the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their advice on the measures I am about to set out.

I can confirm the government judges we have met the fifth test and we are therefore satisfied that all five tests are still being met.

On 11 May, we set out our plan to recover.

That plan as you may remember set out three steps for adjusting the lockdown.

Step 1 was implemented, as planned, on 13 May, enabling people to spend more time outdoors.

Step 2 was implemented, as planned, in phases on    1 and 15 June. Shops have opened, children have started to return to school and people have been able to see more of their loved ones.

Now Step 3 can be implemented, as planned, on 4 July.

All the measures I am about to set out apply to England - the devolved administrations are responsible for adjusting lockdown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, moving at the pace they believe is right for them.

After a long period of asking you, the British public, to follow very strict and complex rules to bring coronavirus under control, we can now make life easier for people to see more of their friends and family, and to help businesses get back on their feet and people back into jobs.

Critically, we can make a change to the guidance on two metres, which kept us safe while transmission of the virus was high but which can now be modified.

Having considered all the evidence, while staying at two metres is preferable, we can now move to “1 metre plus” where it is not possible for us to stay two metres apart. This means staying one metre apart, plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission.

These precautions could include installing screens, making sure people face away from each other, providing handwashing facilities, minimising the amount of time you spend with people outside your household, and of course being outdoors.

On public transport, it means one metre plus wearing a face covering for mitigation, as everybody I think now understands.

We are setting out COVID-Secure guidance to help businesses take the measures that are right for them.

We can also allow more sectors to reopen on 4 July, as planned for Step 3.

So, from 4 July, the following premises will be allowed to reopen provided they are COVID-Secure:

hotels, bed and breakfasts and self-contained holiday accommodation
  caravan parks and campsites
  places of worship and libraries
  restaurants and cafes
  bars, pubs and social clubs
  cinemas and bingo halls
  museums and galleries
  hair salons and barbers
  outdoor playgrounds and outdoor gyms
This has been an incredibly tough time for these establishments. But I hope that everyone working in them can take confidence in knowing they will be able to open their doors once again in just a couple of weeks’ time.

And of course they should do so in a way that is COVID-Secure, keeping customers and staff safe.

But I am afraid to say that some premises, such as nightclubs, swimming pools and indoor gyms, must remain closed for now given the particular risks of transmission in those settings. However, we are establishing taskforces for those sectors to establish how they too can open, in a COVID-Secure way, as fast as possible.

At the same time, we can give people more freedom to see their friends and family.

From 4 July, your household will be able to meet with one other household at a time, including staying over.

This can be indoors or outside, at your home, in a restaurant or pub, or in paid accommodation.

I want to stress you should remain socially distant from anyone outside your household.

For meeting outdoors, you can continue to meet in a park or a garden in a group of up to six people, drawn from six different households.

Again, at all times you should maintain social distancing from anyone outside your household.

As we give people back more control over their lives, we will be asking them to follow guidance on limiting their social contact, rather than forcing them to do so through legislation.

And this obviously requires everyone to act responsibly, which I have no doubt they will do. It will still be possible for the police to break up large and irresponsible gatherings. But neither the police themselves, or the public that they serve, want virtually every aspect of our behaviour to be subject to the criminal law.

Yesterday the Deputy Chief Medical Officer and the Health Secretary set out updated advice for those who are shielding in England, so that they can soon start to return to leading more normal lives.

Opening up more of Britain in this COVID-Secure way is only possible if everyone continues to stay alert to the risks of coronavirus.

That means you should:

stay 2 metres apart and if you can’t do that then keep 1 metre apart with mitigations
  wash your hands regularly
  wear face coverings on public transport, or where you are indoors in a crowded environment where distancing is not possible
  follow the rules when visiting businesses
  crucially, get a test done immediately if you develop symptoms
  and self-isolate if you are asked to by NHS Test and Trace
We are only able to make these changes because we have persevered together and stuck to our path.

We had five tests - and we met them.

We had a plan - and we stuck to it.

The government has asked a huge amount of all of you, and the people of this country have met that challenge with good humour and common sense.

Of course, the fight is far from over. This is a nasty virus still that wants to take advantage of our carelessness. I’m afraid there will be local outbreaks. And I must tell you that if the virus were to begin to run out of control, I will not hesitate to put on the handbrake on and reverse some of these changes, at a local or indeed national level as required.

But we can avoid that if we all continue to stay alert and do our bit to control the virus. The British public have proved again and again, not that it was ever in doubt it, that they can be trusted to do the right thing and to do it with common sense.

There is no doubt we are beating back this virus and, with your continued cooperation and good judgment we will beat it once and for all.

"50","Speech","Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 April 2020","Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab gave the 16 April 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 16 April 2020:
Coronavirus press conference 16 April 2020.

Good afternoon, welcome to the daily coronavirus press conference from Downing Street.

I’m joined by Sir Patrick Valance, the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor, and Professor Chris Whitty, the government’s Chief Medical Officer. Sir Patrick will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus.

But, first, let me update you on the steps we are taking to defeat the coronavirus, and the decisions we have taken today.

Step-by-step, our action plan aims to slow the spread of the virus. So that fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, and that is the way we can protect the NHS from being overwhelmed.

At every step along this way, we have followed, very carefully and deliberately, the scientific and medical advice that we have received. So that we take the right steps at the right moment in time.

At the same time, we are dramatically expanding NHS capacity, in terms of the numbers of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment on the front-line, so people get the care they need, at the point in time that they need it most.

And that’s also why we have directed people to stay at home. To deny coronavirus the opportunity to spread, to protect the NHS and save lives.

Now, today’s data shows that:

327, 608 people in the UK have now been tested for the coronavirus
  103,093 people have tested positive
  and sadly, of those with the virus, 13,729 have now died
These are heart-breaking losses for every family affected. And it reminds us exactly why we need to follow the social distancing guidance.

Earlier today, I chaired meetings of the Cabinet and COBR to consider the advice from SAGE on the impact of the existing social distancing measures.

There are indications that the measures we have put in place have been successful in slowing down the spread of the virus. But, SAGE also say that it is a mixed and inconsistent picture and, in some settings, infections are still likely to be increasing.

SAGE assess that the rate of infection, or the R value, is almost certainly below 1 in the community. That means that on average each infected person is, in turn, infecting less than one other person.

But, overall, we still don’t have the infection rate down as far as we need to. As in other countries, we have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes.

In sum, the very clear advice we have received is that any change to our social distancing measures now would risk a significant increase in the spread of the virus.

That would threaten a second peak of the virus, and substantially increase the number of deaths. It would undo the progress made to date, and as a result, would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.

So early relaxation would do more damage to the economy over a longer period.

I want to be clear about this. The advice from SAGE is that relaxing any of the measures currently in place would risk damage to both public health and our economy. Patrick and Chris will be able to go into further detail on all of this shortly.

But based on this advice, the government has determined that current measures must remain in place for at least the next 3 weeks.

Now, in terms of the decisions that lie ahead, we want to be as up front with the British people as we possibly can. So, let me set out 5 specific things which the government will need to be satisfied of before we will consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures.

First, we must protect the NHS’s ability to cope. We must be confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. The NHS staff have been incredible. We must continue to support them as much as we can.

Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from coronavirus so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.

Third, we need to have reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.

Fourth, we need to be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.

Fifth, and this is really crucial, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS. The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of the virus to hit the NHS and hit the British people. It would be the worst outcome, not just for public health, but for the economy and for our country as a whole.

So, the current restrictions will remain in place. The government will continue to monitor the data on the impact of the virus.

We will soon be able to test 100,000 people every day. That will give us greater understanding of the scope of infection across the country. It will also help us plan how to change the measures when we are ready to.

When we are confident on these 5 points.

Guided by science and data, we will look to adjust the measures to make them as effective as possible in protecting public health, while allowing some economic and social activity to resume. We will only do it, when the evidence demonstrates that is safe to do it.

It could involve relaxing measures in some areas, while strengthening measures in other areas. But in formulating the right balance we will be at all times guided by the scientific advice and the evidence.

I should add at this point that we recognise all the economic and social impact the current measures are having. That is why we put in place an unprecedented package of support for jobs and businesses, as well as for hospices and charities who are doing so much to support the most vulnerable in our society.

And, I know that many people would like to hear more detail, some people are calling for exact dates, on what will happen next, and when.

We are as being as open as we responsibly can at this stage. And it would not be responsible to pre-judge the evidence that SAGE will have and review in just a few weeks’ time.

I know some people will look at other countries, and ask why the UK isn’t doing what they’re doing.

I can reassure people that we carefully follow what is happening in other countries. We will always look to learn any lessons in how they are approaching their response. And I’m talking to foreign ministers on a daily basis, I know Chris and Patrick are doing the same with their opposite numbers around the world.

Ultimately, we have to do what is right for the British people, based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions here in the UK, and we will make those decisions at the right time for this country.

That’s what we have done so far. That’s what we will continue to do.

I appreciate the impact of these measures is considerable on people and businesses across the country. The costs being shouldered. The sacrifices people are making. Being isolated from friends and family. Whole households, cooped up inside, all week long.

Parents having difficult conversations with their young children, who just don’t understand why they can’t visit grandparents or go outside and meet up with friends as they normally do. Families struggling managing home-schooling, and balancing that with working from home.

I know there are people very concerned about their household finances. Uncertain about their jobs. Worried for their small businesses that remain closed.

We get it. We know it’s rough going at this time.

Every time I come to this lectern, and I read out the grim toll of people who have so sadly passed away. I walk away from here, and I think about what their sons and their daughters must be going through right now. Their brothers and sisters. Their grandchildren. All the loved ones left with their unbearable, long-term, grief.

It makes me and it makes this government focus even harder on what we must do. And, I know that, together, united, we must keep up this national effort for a while longer.

We’ve just come too far, we’ve lost too many loved ones, we’ve already sacrificed far too much to ease up now, especially when we’re beginning to see the evidence that our efforts are starting to pay off.

And your efforts are paying off. There is light at the end of the tunnel.

But, we’re now at both a delicate and dangerous stage of this pandemic. If we rush to relax the measures in place, we would risk wasting all the sacrifices and all the progress we have made. And that would risk a quick return to another lockdown. With all the threat to life a second peak of the virus would bring, and all the economic damage a second lockdown would carry. So we need to be patient a while longer.

So please please stay home, save lives and protect the NHS. So we can safely return to life as close to normal as possible, as soon as possible.

It’s been an incredible national team effort. Now is not the moment to give the coronavirus a second chance. 
Let’s stick together, let’s see this through. And let’s defeat the coronavirus for good.

Thank you Maty and Diplosphere for the invitation to speak tonight, and for convening such an interesting group of people.  I don’t know about everyone here, but for me COVID-19 was only really in my peripheral vision at the start of the year – and then moved fast to become the central preoccupation.  So conversations like this are more important than ever.

The death and disruption caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is unprecedented in our lifetimes.  It is a truly global crisis:  with over 9 million cases worldwide, over 475,000 deaths, and a devastating impact on our economies and way of life.

But has it – as Maty challenges us – killed globalisation?  Has it killed the instinct – at the individual, business and state level – to live, work and travel internationally, to trade across borders, to co-operate in tackling global challenges and pursuing common goods?

Or has it instead changed the nature of globalisation, accelerated geopolitical trends that were already underway, and made international co-operation on global goods even harder than it was before?

I’m going to say, straight away, that I think the answer is b).  COVID hasn’t killed globalisation – but it has made the world a far more dangerous place, and changed how we work, and think, internationally.

So, I’m going to focus on what I see as the risks and opportunities posed by COVID-19 to our globalised world. I’m going to set out a bleak view – sorry – in which the risks far outweigh the opportunities.  But then I’m going to try – good internationalist that I am, to outline where we have had successes to date, where there are opportunities, and how we can best seize them.

Risks posed by COVID-19

The glass half empty view is pretty stark.  Countries have closed their borders to protect against COVID, international aviation has all but fallen off a cliff; and international meeting after international meeting is being cancelled or postponed:  this week was supposed to be the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, Rwanda.

We are seeing an increase in protectionism.  Switzerland’s University of St Gallen found in April that 75 countries had introduced export curbs on medical supplies, equipment or medicines this year.   And of course the economic impact of COVID on lives and livelihoods around the world is staggering.  The IMF is predicting a 5% global contraction, with no country unscathed.

But the impacts are even more significant – and devastating – in the developing world.  After years of progress in lifting people out of poverty –from 44% of people living in global extreme poverty in 1981, to 8% in 2019 - that progress is going to be dramatically reversed.  The World Bank assesses that COVID-19 could push upwards of 71 million people into extreme poverty in 2020.

And the full impact of COVID on the most vulnerable has yet to be seen. In May, coronavirus reached Cox’s Bazaar, the world’s largest refugee camp in Bangladesh. The UN warns that Yemen’s healthcare system has “in effect collapsed”.  Closer to home, Pacific Island countries have succeeded in preventing large scale outbreaks of COVID-19, but are feeling the extreme impacts of the loss of tourism and remittances.

COVID-19 will hit the poorest the hardest.

COVID will also lead to greater instability in some places; in others it will strengthen the strongman.  It risks accelerating the decline of the primacy of liberal states within the international order, and strengthening those who cast issues such as human rights, freedom from surveillance, and freedom of the media as ‘nice to haves’, rather than the essential underpinning of our democracies.

It is exacerbating US-China tensions, accelerating the US withdrawal from its global leadership role, and providing opportunity to hostile states, and those who do not share our values or view of the world.

And there is a serious risk that the urgent climate action that is needed falls into that same bracket of ‘nice to have’ and ‘non-essential’.

So far, so gloomy.

So, let me turn to the glass half full.

Opportunities

A global pandemic requires a global response, and the UK – despite our challenges with COVID-19 at home – has prioritised the international response from the start.

Let me talk about vaccine diplomacy, and our support for the most vulnerable countries.

On vaccine diplomacy, the UK in May co-hosted the Global Coronavirus Response Initiative alongside the European Commission, and eight other countries. The event raised £7 billion for research and development on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, with the UK committing £318 million.

In June the UK hosted the Global Vaccine Summit, with nations pledging $8.8 billion to GAVI, the Global Vaccine Alliance, to immunise 300 million children in the poorest countries by 2025.  New Zealand has contributed $15 million for international research collaboration and a further $7 million GAVI.

Together, we are driving unprecedented global collaboration and resourcing for the development and delivery of new vaccines, treatments and tests at the speed and scale required, to make them available not only in our own communities, but all around the world.

On vulnerable countries, the UK has led international efforts to support the most vulnerable.  We have provided £5.5 billion in financial support to the most vulnerable; we have worked with G20 partners to suspend $12billion of debt payments for the 77 poorest countries in the world; and we are the largest funder of the International Development Assistance Programme, which is delivering major development programmes in the Pacific.

There are positive glimmers on trade, too. I spoke earlier about the rise in protectionism, but should also highlight the efforts – with New Zealand playing a leading role - to keep trade routes and supply chains open.   The UK, like New Zealand, is committed to tackling protectionism, and working with our partners to support free, fair, rules-based international trade.

And we were delighted to launch UK-New Zealand free trade agreement negotiations last week:  beginning a new chapter in UK-NZ co-operation.

Our FTA launch was done virtually, which segues into my next theme:  the role that technology is playing in the changing nature of globalisation.

COVID-19 has accelerated a behavioural shift in how we work. We can do many of the same international meetings from in front of our bookshelves at home, rather than with long-haul travel.  This change is, perhaps, the logical continuation of globalisation. But the pandemic has accelerated its progress, and this could - potentially – become a leveller.

And as we all fly less, our aviation emissions decrease – perhaps by as much as 50% in 2020.   Which brings me to my final source of optimism:  the opportunity to forge a green recovery from COVID-19.

In recovering from COVID, each country will face a choice, between laying the foundations for sound, sustainable and inclusive growth, or locking-in a high carbon trajectory. As we borrow against our children’s future, we must ensure that we have their interests – and that of this planet – at heart.

We must collectively support a green and resilient recovery, building on the principles of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. The economic prize on offer is clear. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are already cheaper than coal in most countries. And the International Renewable Energy Agency assess that boosting investment in renewables would increase jobs in this sector to 42 million globally by 2050.

The UK, as the incoming COP26 President, hosting in partnership with Italy, will continue to press for greater ambition around the world – to reduce emissions, to build resilience, and to cooperate and support each other in a green recovery.

So, to conclude.  We are living in times of great uncertainty, and great disruption.  No one knows when a vaccine will be found, and when we will return to anything like normal.  The challenge facing us – in terms of the global health response, supporting the most vulnerable, and guarding against those who would seek to take advantage of the pandemic, to the detriment of our security and way of life – is enormous.  The outlook is bleak.

And humans are, generally, slow to adapt our behaviours.  But COVID-19 and its response showed us just how fast we can move – at governmental, business and individual level – to change our policies at pace, to change our behaviours.  If we can do it in the face of COVID-19, we should be able to do it for the climate, too.

"52","Speech","Tackling COVID-19 together through the ACT-Accelerator: Foreign Secretary's statements","Dominic Raab co-chaired this high-level event in UNGA 2020, calling for international collaboration for global access to new vaccines, treatments and testing.","Opening statement

I’m delighted to be speaking here today from Vietnam to co-host this event with UN Secretary-General, Dr Tedros, South-African Health Minister Zweli Lawrence Mkhize, and we feel that the issue of equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and tests is absolutely vital and urgent. As Secretary of State for the new Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, we bring together both our diplomatic reach and expertise with our development, aid and experience to this vital agenda.

Scientific cooperation has made breakthroughs at frankly record-breaking pace. With our enhanced collective knowledge, I think we’re in a much better position to tackle this terrible, invisible virus. In the UK, we are proud to play our part, supporting lifesaving treatments and backing up vaccine research with funding and investment.

But new products will only have the influence that we need them to have, the impact on the pandemic, if they reach people who need them. So collaboration under the ACT-Accelerator is our best hope to bring the pandemic under control, and the UK is proud to support this initiative to drive equitable access and global impact through our funding. As my Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, the health of every country depends on the whole world having access to safe and effective vaccines, wherever and whenever that breakthrough may occur. And the UK will do everything we can within our power to bring that about.

We have actively engaged in the collaborative design of the COVAX facility, which is an unprecedented alliance of countries and partners pooling resources to accelerate vaccine development. We want to be able to ensure large-scale manufacturing, rapid delivery of the future vaccines globally and on an equitable basis. I’m very proud that the Prime Minister has announced the UK’s participation in the COVAX facility, which demonstrates our commitment to multilateral solutions to the global challenges that we all face.

The pandemic is really an acid test of our international resolve to work together on the issue of the day, on the issue facing our generation, in order to save lives and rebuild our economies. We don’t just think it’s a moral responsibility, we see the direct national interest that we have and others have in protecting not just our citizens through vaccinating them, but preventing and isolating ourselves from a second global wave that would threaten us all. So we need to work together, we need others to join in that endeavour, and the UK has made a minimum commitment of £250 million and we will add an extra £1 for every $4 committed by others, up to an additional £250 million.

Statements are important, but real collaboration is vital and we’ve got to back our aspirations with the resources necessary. The UK is living up to the responsibility we feel to ensure vaccines, treatments and tests are truly available to all and I call on the international community to step up so we can rise to this ground-breaking challenge together.

Closing statement

Thank you very much. I think we’ve seen from the various different contributions today the importance of the multilateral approaches to ensuring global access to new vaccines, treatments and testing. Collaboration is our best hope to bring the pandemic under control and our best hope to keep our economies and our societies open, which can ensure a genuinely collective economic recovery.

I welcome the renewed commitments that have been made today. I welcome the discussions that we’ve had and all of the contributions that our participants have made. And I think as we look ahead to what will be a very busy autumn, we must use the commitments here today as the moment and the impetus for all of us to rise to the challenge and deliver the leadership and the investment that’s required to make a success of this enormous and daunting challenge. It’s only by working together that we can bring an end to the pandemic for everyone, everywhere.

Thank you very much again.","Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP",2020-09-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/tackling-covid-19-together-through-the-act-accelerator"
"53","Speech","Business Secretary at the CBI 2020 Annual Conference","Business Secretary Alok Sharma's speech for the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) 2020 Annual Conference.","Good morning everyone,

And thank you Karan for that very kind introduction.

I’m absolutely delighted to be addressing such a wide and illustrious business audience today – although virtually and I think that’s a sign of the times.

The Prime Minister will be offering his remarks to the CBI later this week.

But, let me start by paying tribute to Carolyn, for her leadership of the CBI over the last 5 years.

These have been turbulent times for businesses.

And Carolyn has led from the front.

Ensuring that your voices are heard loud and clear across the country and of course within government.

On a personal note, I am very grateful to Carolyn for the constructive and pragmatic discussions we have had over the past months.

We have worked together to help businesses become COVID-secure and deliver unprecedented support from government.

As President of the CBI, Lord Bilimoria will bring the experience and knowledge needed to steer businesses through choppy waters.

And I want to welcome Tony Danker, as the next Director General of the CBI.

These are extraordinary circumstances in which to assume this role.

And I wish Tony the very best.  Because your success will be our shared success in supporting the economy.

My heartfelt thanks and admiration also goes to all of you, the CBI’s members, and businesses up and down the country.

I have had over 1,500 conversations with businesses and business representative organisations across the country since I took on this role.

Including travelling to every part of the United Kingdom.

It is clear that this has not just been a tough year, but the toughest of years.

And we all know that the difficult days are not yet over.

Further lockdown measures

On Saturday evening, the Prime Minister announced further restrictions across England, to take action to control the virus and protect the NHS.

And to head off the need for even tougher or more enduring restrictions further down the line.

Which means that from Thursday 5 November, until Wednesday 2 December:

People may only leave home for specific reasons including work if they can’t work from home.

Non-essential shops, personal care, indoor and outdoor leisure, and entertainment venues will close.

Although shops can continue to provide click and collect services and I know that’s been appreciated by business.

Pubs, bars and restaurants will close, except for takeaway and delivery services.

However, people will be able to travel to work, where necessary to allow them to do continue to do their job.

And sectors such as construction and manufacturing will remain open.

And it’s vital that scientists and engineers working in R&D including those fighting the virus continue to come together in labs and workplaces across the country.

I do not under-estimate just how difficult these measures will be for businesses.

Many of which have already had to endure hardship this year.

So, alongside these measures, we have announced further support.

These include an extension of the furlough scheme at 80% to protect jobs.

Grants of up to £3,000 per month for premises that are forced to close.

£1.1 billion for local authorities to enable them to support businesses.

I am grateful that the CBI, and so many of you, have welcomed these measures.

As business leaders told me on Saturday evening, after the Prime Minister’s statement, these measures will save jobs.

And I will continue to speak to businesses and representative groups to champion your voice at the heart of government.

I do appreciate just how tough these restrictions are on businesses and workers across the country.

How hard it is not knowing when you may be able to trade.

Worrying about your order book and how you will pay your overheads.

It goes against every fibre of my being for us to tell entrepreneurs they must down tools.

Shutter-up your businesses.

Limit your ability to do what you do so well.

Government support during COVID-19

But that is why, alongside the restrictions, we have taken historic steps this year to keep businesses afloat.

We have protected almost 10 million jobs through furlough.

Approved more than a million government-backed loans, to the tune of over £62 billion.

Paid out almost £14 billion in support of around 3 million self-employed people.

Cut VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector.

Waived over £10 billion of business rates, supporting close to 400,000 businesses.

Given £11 billion in grants covering almost 900,000 business properties.

Brought in a range of regulatory easements to help businesses.

And I’m pleased to say, we’ve already created thousands of placements through our ground-breaking Kick Start Scheme.

Creating jobs for young people, who are amongst the most at risk of long-term unemployment in these difficult times.

We have been there for you since the start.

We are here for you now.

And we’ll be there for you, for as long as you need us.

A salute to British business

But for all the hundreds of billions of pounds of help from the taxpayer, it is you who have done the hard work to keep your businesses going.

You, and those working for the businesses you represent, have been straining every sinew on construction sites.

Powering our factories.

Keeping our transport system moving.

Serving us in supermarkets.

Delivering vital goods in droves.

Putting in shifts from the manufacturing to the service sectors.

Cramming your office work into flats, homes and studies.

And much, much more.

You have demonstrated levels of resolve, resilience, and community spirit the likes of which we have never seen in peacetime.

And innovation that we never dreamed of.

We saw Formula One teams throwing themselves into the ventilator challenge.

A Caerphilly packaging company that turned out 15 million bits of PPE.

We had gin distilleries making hand sanitiser.

High street shops have evolved into online retailers.

From the FTSE 100 to the corner shop, you simply refused to be beaten.

Without our fantastic private sector, without our entrepreneurs, our country would not, could not, have stayed on its feet this year.

I have been humbled at some of the personal sacrifices businesses have had to make to protect the livelihoods of their employees.

It is the absolute definition of responsible capitalism.

And for that I salute each and every one of you.

Vaccine and mass testing

And I want to bottle the hope and innovation you have demonstrated and unleash it as we move forward and beat this virus.

I have seen through my Department the brilliant collaborative work between business and our world-class scientists, in developing a vaccine.

As we speak, the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine is in final-phase trials.  With the prospect of a vaccine early next year.

Whilst there has been rapid progress, we recognise that a vaccine which fully eliminates the virus may never materialise.

So we plan to also protect the country in other ways.

As the Prime Minister set out on Saturday, we have the immediate prospect of using many millions of cheap, reliable and rapid turnaround tests.

Over the next few days and weeks, we will plan a steady but significant deployment of these tests.

There are paths out of this current predicament.

To eventually get business fully on its feet and the economy firing on all cylinders.

A great place for business

Because we all know that the United Kingdom is a great country to do business.

We have the lowest corporate tax rates in the G20.

The kind of lean regulation that puts us in the global top 10 for ease of doing business.

And a highly skilled workforce.

It is easy to see why the UK is consistently home to one of the largest, most resilient economies in the world.

All underlining precisely why the UK has long been a great place to do business.

Brexit

And we will open up further opportunities as we take advantage of our new political, legal and economic freedoms as the transition period ends this year.

The negotiations on our future relationship with the EU are ongoing.

At the same time, I urge you to prepare for the future trading relationship in 2 months’ time.

Because whatever the outcome, things will change for businesses across our country.

As the transition period comes to an end, and it will not be extended, we are making preparations to ensure the economy is ready.

Such as legislating for a UK internal market to avoid trade barriers when EU legal structures fall away.

A step which, many of you have told us, removes a major item from your corporate risk registers.

My Department, and I, are communicating and engaging with millions of businesses.

Providing information to help them prepare, as we accelerate towards our new trading relationship with the EU.

And whether we trade on the same terms as Canada or Australia, I know we will make it a success for British businesses and for the whole country.

Because Brexit was always about a better future.

About having the freedom to chart our own course.

And in doing so, bringing much-needed opportunities as we pursue our destiny as an independent nation.

Building back greener

We will take advantage of these opportunities to support our economic recovery from COVID.

I want to ensure we do so in a way that enables the economy to build back greener.

Because it is vital that we not only grow, but we grow sustainably.

UK businesses are at the forefront of this.

Over the last 30 years, the UK economy grew by 75%, and yet we also cut our emissions by 43%.

We were the first major economy to legislate for achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050.

Which not only has the buy-in from businesses across the UK, but increasingly our international partners.

I was in South Korea last week when President Moon announced his country’s ambition to achieve Net Zero by 2050, following Japan just a few days earlier.

We will continue to use our COP26 leadership to extend these ambitions across the globe.

I sincerely believe that we are at an inflection point.

With governments, businesses and civil society all now recognising the imperative of tackling climate change.

Many of you already see Net Zero as an opportunity to grow.

Which is why we announced a £3 billion stimulus package over the summer to support the decarbonisation of buildings.

And why the Prime Minister announced last month, that we would aim to install 40GW of offshore wind by 2030.

Extending our position as the world’s leading offshore wind producer.

I hope you take advantage of the immediate opportunities this green agenda brings, as we recover from the COVID pandemic.

Skills

And as we create the jobs of tomorrow, we need a laser-like focus on skills.

We are overhauling post-18 education with a new focus on technical courses, and providing £1.5 billion to upgrade and improve college buildings.

Our Lifetime Skills Guarantee is ending the absurd situation where someone’s economic destiny is set in stone as a teenager.

The government’s new Office for Talent will make it easier for the most skilled individuals in your sectors to come and work for you, wherever they may be in the world today.

Infrastructure

And our record-breaking investment in infrastructure will help connect us all.

Coronavirus has shown that, while we can all work a little more flexibly, people still want and need to come together to do business.

The watercooler moment that takes a seed of an idea and grows it into a new business opportunity cannot be replicated in a carefully scheduled online chat.

It is this government that is putting money into roads and trains and buses in every community across the country.

It is this government that has finally broken ground on HS2.

And it is this government that has launched Project Speed.

So that everything from new hospitals, to long-overdue flood defences, are given form rather than languishing for years on the drawing board.

We are investing almost £600 billion in our future prosperity, delivering infrastructure projects across the UK.

Levelling up

And we will build back better through levelling up across the country.

Because for all the success of our economy, that success has long been poorly spread.

No other city coming close to the economic heft of London, which outstrips Manchester six times over.

An imbalance that was intolerable before coronavirus.

But which takes on a fresh urgency, with our already fragile cities and towns taking the greatest hit from the pandemic.

So we will turbocharge our regions, to enable them to become global hubs in their own right.

The North East of England could become the home of choice for companies delivering carbon capture and storage.

Making hydrogen power a part of daily life.

And designing, building and maintaining offshore wind turbines.

Our brilliant life sciences sector will be propelled to even greater heights from Oxford, Cambridge and Edinburgh.

The factories of the Midlands will roar back into life, producing the advanced technologies of tomorrow.

As we broaden the geography of our economy, we will help you widen and deepen the range of businesses that comprise it.

With a more strategic approach to supporting research and innovation in areas where the UK has the potential to both lead and change the world.

We are doubling our investment in R&D.

Putting rocket boosters under technologies in clean energy, life sciences, AI and advanced manufacturing.

We will support businesses to scale up – securing a thriving hive of mid-sized businesses.

And I want to work with you to develop our new strategy for growth.

A refreshed and reinvigorated industrial strategy, putting the UK at the forefront of economic opportunity as we build back better.

Conclusion

This whole strategy, this plan, is not some hypothetical vision or academic exercise.

It is already underway.

Clean energy, the overhaul of technical education, the largest investment in infrastructure we’ve ever seen, it’s all happening.

So as we work with you, and support you through the pandemic, we will lay the foundations for future growth that will endure long after we have emerged from the shadow of coronavirus.

And I want you to help me build on those foundations.

To work together, as our new plan for growth takes shape in the months ahead and is published in the New Year.

Creating a more resilient economy.

A cleaner, greener economy, in which we have control of our own laws and trading policies.

Providing new opportunities for businesses across the UK.

Delivering growth and jobs.

So that a decade from now, when the CBI gathers for its 2030 conference, we will be able to say:

We built it together.

A revived, rejuvenated, sovereign and technology-leading United Kingdom.

With opportunity and prosperity spread equally across our great nation.

Coronavirus press conference 30 April 2020.

Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference. I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Adviser.

On Saturday, I spoke to the Prime Minister. I updated him on coronavirus, the progress we’re making, and our plans for the next few weeks.

The government is united in our focus, our determination and our national mission to defeat the coronavirus.
And defeat it, we will.

I want to join the PM in expressing our heart-felt thanks to the brilliant NHS team at St Thomas’s hospital.
And, as the Easter bank holiday weekend draws to a close, I also need to thank all of the NHS staff, all of the other frontline staff, who have been working so hard over the long weekend to care for those suffering from coronavirus.

We thank you.

We pay tribute to you.

And we’re immensely proud of all you are doing.

Can I also take the opportunity to thank everyone who followed the advice to stay home, despite the wonderful weather, and despite the challenges and sacrifices that sticking to the advice presents to many families.
I have to say that at the end of last week, we were concerned that people might start ignoring the advice, or cutting corners given the temptation to go out into the sunshine.

In fact, the overwhelming majority of people stayed at home and understood the importance of doing so.

You stuck to the advice.

You denied the coronavirus of the social contact it needs to spread.

People should be in absolutely no doubt that, by staying home this weekend, you have saved lives, and you also helped protect our precious NHS at this critical moment in the crisis.

So thank you.

Your efforts are making all the difference, and please keep them up.

We’ve come too far, we’ve lost too many loved ones, and we’ve sacrificed far too much to ease up now.

I can tell you on the latest data that 290,720 have been tested for coronavirus, 88,621 have now tested positive.
And, I’m very sorry to say, 11,329 people have now died from coronavirus, every one of them a tragedy, and our hearts go out to all of the loved ones who are grieving their loss at such a difficult time.

Amidst this sobering death toll, there are also some positive signs from the data that we are starting to win this struggle, but we have still got a long way to go and as those grisly figures I just read out show, we’re still not past the peak of this virus.

So please continue to follow the advice, now more than ever, to stay at home, save lives and protect our NHS.
This week, SAGE will review the evidence of the effectiveness of the social distancing measures we’ve taken, and we will consider their assessment, based on the evidence, at that point.

I should say, we don’t expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point, and we won’t, until we’re confident as we realistically can be, that any such changes can be safely made.

In the meantime, the government will continue to redouble all of our efforts to buy and deliver the ventilators so we can treat the most vulnerable in our hospitals.

To deliver the masks, the gowns and other protective equipment to protect those on the frontline, in the NHS, but also in care homes.

And to ramp up testing so that the NHS and other key staff can return to the frontline just as soon as possible.
The Chancellor and Business Secretary are working round the clock to mitigate the damage that this crisis has undoubtedly done to our economy - getting support to businesses, to workers and to the most vulnerable in our society.

So please, once again, keep following the guidance to stay home, save lives and protect the NHS.

If we let up now the virus will only take full advantage.

It will spread faster and it will kill more people.

If we refuse to give into it, if we keep up this incredible team effort, we will beat this virus, and we will come through this national test.

Our plan is working.

Please stick with it, and we’ll get through this crisis together.

Good afternoon.

Welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press briefing.

I’m joined by our National Medical Director of NHS England, Professor Steve Powis, and Professor John Newton from Public Health England.

Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of the virus so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the NHS’s ability to cope.

At each point, we have been following scientific and medical advice and been deliberate in our actions – taking the right steps at the right time.

We are also taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the numbers of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment to the frontline to give people the care they need when they need it most.

I’ve been away for a week now and I’m delighted to be back.

In the past week, we have completed the construction of a whole new hospital, NHS Nightingale, built in 9 days.

With 4,000 beds, this will be the equivalent of 10 district general hospitals.

And there’s more to come in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, where the military has been working wonders in helping to construct.

This has been an incredible achievement and I want to thank all of those involved.

And I also want to thank those people who have followed the social distancing with admirable fortitude and spirit. Steve will update us on the progress that’s been made.

Third, I want to pay huge tribute to all those in councils, primary care and community care, pharmacies and the unbelievable 750,000 volunteers who have signed up to shielding the most vulnerable.

This is Britain at its best.

Sadly, the coronavirus continues to grow.

I can report that, through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, according to the latest figures:

163,194 people have now been tested for the virus
  and 33,718 have tested positive
The best scientific analysis is that the rate of infection has been doubling every 3 or 4 days.

The number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms is now 12,949.

Of those who have contracted the virus, 2,921 have, sadly, died. We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of these victims.

If the past few weeks have shown anything, it is that we are steadfast as a country in our resolve to defeat this invisible killer.

I am profoundly moved by the compassion and the commitment that we are seeing from people across the country.

And, in the health and care system, we have lost colleagues too – doctors, nurses and mental health professionals. They have paid the ultimate price for their service, working to care for others.

I just want to say this on my behalf of all my colleagues in health and social care.

I am awed by the dedication of my colleagues on the frontline – every single person who contributes to the running of this diverse and caring institution that our nation holds so dear. These were people who came to this country to make a difference. And they did. And they have given their lives in service, in sacrifice. We salute you.

And I tell you this. I will fight this virus with everything I have got. And we still strain every sinew to defeat it once and for all. I will stop at nothing to make sure that frontline staff have the right equipment so that they are safe and can have the confidence they need to do their jobs.

And I know that people have asked questions about protective equipment.

With the support of the British military, we have shipped record quantities of equipment to the frontline.

Just yesterday, 45 million pieces of protective equipment were delivered across health and social care, including more than 5 million aprons and 6 million surgical masks.

Today, Public Health England have announced the upgraded PPE standards that people should use and expect.

The upgraded guidance has been developed through intense consultation with stakeholders across the board and staff on the frontline. We have listened and put the interests of our healthcare staff first and put them at the heart of this.

This guidance recommends the appropriate level of PPE to protect people in all different circumstances.

These standards are among the highest in the world and in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization. I am delighted that they have been welcomed by the medical royal colleges, the BMA, the Royal College of Nursing and the trade unions.

Any health or care organisation that needs PPE should call the hotline so that our military operation for delivering PPE can get that protective equipment to you.

These are unprecedented times for our health and care services. And I want to make sure every part of our health and care system is supported.

I have therefore made £300 million available for funding for community pharmacies, who do so much to get people vital medicines. And are themselves on the NHS frontline.

And today, to help NHS trusts to deliver what’s needed without worrying about past finances, I can announce that I am writing off over £13.4 billion of historic NHS debt.

This landmark step will not only put the NHS in a stronger position to respond to this global coronavirus pandemic, but will also provide our NHS with stronger foundations as we recover.

But this is only one part of the picture.

And I understand why people are yearning for the certainty that good-quality testing can provide. I get it.

Public Health England can be incredibly proud of the world-beating work they have been doing on testing.

The roll-out of its COVID-19 diagnostic test is the fastest deployment of a novel test in recent history, including the swine flu pandemic in 2009.

But I am going to level with you about the challenges we face and the plan we have to rise to that challenge.

I am going to go through some of the challenges in very specific detail. And then talk about the plan we have to drive this forward with a significant increase in testing.

First, unlike some countries, we didn’t go into this crisis with a huge diagnostics industry. We have the best scientific labs in the world, but we do not have scale. My German counterpart for instance could call upon a hundred test labs, ready and waiting when the crisis struck – thanks to Roche, one of the biggest diagnostics companies in the world.

We have had to build from that lower base.

Next, there is the demand for materials. There has been a shortage of both swabs and reagents. Thanks to the ingenuity of my team, we have fixed the swabs issue, and we are tackling the shortage of reagents.

We are solving this reagents issue, but, as the head of Roche and the President of the United States have commented, this is a global challenge. I am sure we will get there.

Next, there is the challenge of prioritisation.

I understand why NHS staff want tests so they can get back to the frontline. Of course I do.

But I took the decision that the first priority has to be patients for whom the result of the test can lead to a difference in treatment. That is the difference between life and death. I believe anybody in my shoes would have made the same decision.

I am proud that every single patient who has needed a test for life-saving treatment has had access to a test.

But of course NHS staff need access to testing too. And I am delighted that at the weekend we could roll this access out for the first time.

And there is the challenge of making sure that the public can have confidence in the tests.

Several of the tests that we are currently checking have failed. In one case, a test that I am being urged to buy missed 3 out of 4 positive cases of coronavirus.

That means in three-quarters of cases that test would have given the false comfort of sending someone with coronavirus back on the wards. Approving tests that don’t work is dangerous and I will not do it.

Now I want to set out my plan to boost testing.

Let us be clear about the goal.

Firstly, always to ensure that testing is available for patients who need it.

Next, to expand testing of critical NHS staff and their families. And I can announce today that we are expanding testing for NHS staff further.

Third, as we ramp up the numbers, we will test critical key workers.

And, over time, we will expand testing to the community.

Our ultimate goal is that anyone who needs a test should have one. Now let me take a moment to set out my 5-pillar testing strategy to achieve these goals.

The first pillar is swab testing in PHE labs and NHS hospitals. This is the testing to find out if you currently have the virus.

We have already reached our target of 10,000 tests per day, precisely on time, by the end of March as committed. And we are committed to reaching 25,000 tests per day by the end of April at the latest.

Because it allows the NHS to identify and effectively care for those who are most seriously ill – saving lives by helping clinicians decide the most effective treatment options. I can reassure you that every single patient who needs a test is able to have one, and this is how we’re able to provide people with the right care and treatment in hospitals.

The second pillar is the creation of brand new swab testing capacity delivered by commercial partners. Again, this is swab testing to tell if people have the virus.

The biggest part of pillar 2 is the partnership with universities, research institutes and companies, such as Amazon and Boots, to build from scratch a network of new labs and testing sites across the UK.

This brand new service has just launched, and is ramping up rapidly. The trials of this have successfully completed and the number of tests at this facility will significantly increase this weekend.

To begin with, this capacity will be used solely for frontline NHS staff and their families.

Increasing testing capacity for NHS staff will allow more doctors and nurses who do not have the disease to safely go back to work and treat those who are most in need of care.

These are currently in the final stages of development. As of now, over 5,000 NHS workers have been tested across 5 new testing sites.

Currently only 5.7% of doctors in England are absent due to COVID-19. Of course, we want to get these numbers down.

We are working with other testing companies to expand pillar 2 so that over time we have many different commercial companies delivering mass swab testing.

The third pillar is blood tests.

Blood tests are designed to tell whether people have had the virus and are now immune. These tests are done by taking a blood sample and looking for the presence of the right COVID-19 antibodies. These could potentially be done at home with a finger prick, and deliver results in as little as 20 minutes.

We are currently working with 9 companies who are offering these tests and are evaluating their effectiveness.

These antibody tests, blood tests, offer the hope that people who think they have had the disease will know they are immune and get back to life as normal. But they have got to work.

The fourth pillar is surveillance. We are conducting some of the biggest surveys in the world to find out what proportion of the population have already had the virus.This is done using an ultra-high accuracy antibody test operated by Public Health England at their Porton Down science campus. We have capacity for 3,500 of these tests per week, enough for population sampling to begin with.

Robust population surveillance programmes are essential to understanding the rate of infection, and how the virus is spreading across the country.

We will use these tests to help us strengthen our scientific understanding and inform us all on the big choices we have to make about social distancing measures and how we exit from this crisis.

We did not start this crisis with a large diagnostics industry. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t build one.

Just as our top-end manufacturers have joined the national effort to build ventilators, so our pharmaceutical companies will do the same for testing. Our pharmaceutical giants, like AstraZeneca and GSK, which have no great history in diagnostics, are now working with our world leading, but small, diagnostics companies, to build a British diagnostics industry at scale.

The new national effort for testing will ensure we can get tests for everyone who needs them.

I am delighted that the pharmaceutical industry is rising to the challenge and putting unprecedented resources into testing.

Taken together, I am now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day, by the end of this month. That is the goal and I am determined that we will get there.

To drive this work forward, I’m pleased that Professor John Newton from Public Health England will be taking on a new role to lead this national effort for testing, working with my brilliant departmental officials, the NHS and the life sciences industry. Professor Newton is widely recognised as a leading voice on public health and I am thrilled that we can bring to bear his considerable experience on this vital issue.

My 5 pillars represent a comprehensive plan to put in place the testing that is mission critical as we fight this battle against COVID-19.

There will be problems, like those that we have already overcome. After all, building a brand new industry from scratch is not easy. There will be bumps in the road and criticisms made – some of them justified.

And I return from illness more determined than ever before to fight this disease.

We will bring together the best minds and the best science this country has to offer. And we will work with our friends and allies all across the world as we do so.

Because we are in the midst of a war against an invisible enemy. And it is a war in which all of humanity is on the same side.

And history has shown us that, when the world unites against a common foe, we will always prevail.

As the Prime Minister said yesterday, mass testing is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle and defeat it in the end.

But, in the meantime, while the disease is still spreading rapidly and the government builds up the ability to test on a mass scale, the most important thing to do is for people to stay at home. Protect the NHS. And save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-04-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-2-april-2020"

It is precisely 8 months – to the day – since we gathered for the AOA annual dinner.

It was a memorable night.

Over 800 guests packed in to the Grosvenor House Ballroom, one of London’s most spectacular venues.

Celebrating another record-breaking year for UK airports.

However, in hindsight, that dinner has taken on greater significance.

It was the last time the airport industry was able to gather on such a scale.

The last time many of you were able to interact and socialise with colleagues.

The last time things were ‘normal’, before all our lives changed so dramatically.

Just a week after that dinner, we were in lockdown.

Looking back to the speeches that evening, of course we all knew the threat posed by the virus was extremely serious.

And unlike anything aviation had faced before.

Yet the industry’s experience since then, as 2020 has unfolded, has been far more devastating than anyone could have imagined at the beginning of March (2020).

Without doubt the toughest ever year for commercial aviation.

And it’s a matter of immense regret that last week we had to tighten restrictions once again to stem the spread of this wretched virus.

I know this was another dire blow for aviation.

To support businesses, the Chancellor last week extended the furlough scheme until March (2021).

And the government will be ready to talk to firms who are most acutely affected.

But of course, we’re not alone in taking tougher action.

One thing we’ve always known about Covid is that it’s no respecter of borders.

That’s why virtually every nation around us is currently in some form of lockdown.

Many airports across Europe closed or operating a skeleton service.

We know that a new UK lockdown means more uncertainty, more worry, and more hard times for aviation.

But if we’d failed to act last week, with the virus spreading so fast, the prospects for this industry, and many others, would have been even bleaker.

Events over the weekend affecting passengers and freight coming from Denmark where the virus has mutated into mink and back into humans again demonstrated the need for vigilance.

And the need for us to work together so we can act quickly and decisively.

Let me make it clear.

The safe and sustainable return of international air travel depends on us getting infections under control.

A view shared by almost every nation. every chief medical officer and scientific expert

But, as we enter perhaps the darkest hour for aviation, I do see hope.

A new recovery

We’ve learned a lot over those 8 months.

We’re much better informed than we were last spring.

We know far more about the virus, how it spreads, and what we need to do to keep it at bay.

We know more about protecting the health of passengers and staff at airports.

And more about patterns of infection around the UK, and internationally.

Which has, for example, allowed us to start including islands as a sub-national approach to the travel corridor list.

The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office continues to update Covid advice to passengers.

Which now references the relevant domestic guidance on travel within the United Kingdom, together with developing risks in other countries and regions.

This more bespoke route called for by the travel sector will help British nationals make more informed decisions about journeys.

And – of course – we know a lot more about testing now.

With daily NHS capacity having reached more than half a million people a day by the end of October (2020).

And through the new Global Travel Taskforce.

Which I co-chair with the Health Secretary.

I want you to know that we’ve been making good progress on a ‘test to release’ programme to launch once we’re out of lockdown.

This will consist of a single test for arrivals into the UK, provided by the private sector and at the cost of the passenger.

Allowing a much reduced period of self isolation.

Beyond the lockdown, this should encourage many more people to book flights with confidence knowing there is an option that allows them to shorten self isolation.

We have been working extensively with health experts and the private testing sector on the practicalities of the new regime.

For example, making sure that it doesn’t impact on NHS capacity.

We will report to the Prime Minister very soon, with recommendations how we can support the recovery of international tourism and travel and increase consumer confidence.

In addition to this arrivals regime, we are working with partner countries to consider self-isolation and testing options that could be performed before departure.

I know it’s been confusing for passengers trying to understand different testing regimes for each nation.

So we are leading international work to develop a framework for international travel to provide global consistency.

An accepted international standard if you like.

The type of lateral flow tests currently being trialled in Liverpool also give hope for optimism.

This is a highly accurate swab test that gives results in less than an hour, and doesn’t need to go to a lab.

Ultimately, it could open the way for non-quarantined air travel.

The primary solution to the aviation crisis is getting passengers flying safely again.

Ultimately, through the development of an effective vaccine.

But before that, through effective testing.

And we will consider all options that can help aviation recover safely.

Supporting industry

These measures will build on the help we’ve already provided this year.

Furlough support for 55,000 aviation employees.

This alone worth £1 billion to £2 billion to the sector.

Then there have been loans and tax deferrals.

And £1.8 billion to the industry through Covid Corporate Financing.

In fact this accounts for 11% of total national funding under the programme across our entire economy – just to aviation.

We have stepped up to strengthen protection for consumers too.

By backing the ATOL protection scheme.

And we took action on flight slots earlier in the year.

So airlines didn’t have to operate empty flights to hold on to valuable slots.

Regional connectivity

Inevitably most of the focus has been on international aviation.

But I also want to stress the government’s determination to boost domestic connectivity as we rebound from Covid.

Back in May, we invested £5.7 million to safeguard flights from London to Belfast and Derry airports in Northern Ireland.

Regional flights are going to be even more important in the months ahead as we seek to repair and reconnect our economy.

Binding every part of the union together.

And linking regional airports with global hubs.

That’s why we’re continuing to work on our Regional Air Connectivity Review.

To ensure it reflects the changing nature of the industry.

And I particularly welcome your engagement through the Expert Steering Group and bilaterial discussions.

Longer term

It’s crucial we rebuild for the longer term too.

It’s hard to appreciate right now but the prospects for aviation in the long term are very positive indeed.

We just need to get through this.

Not only will there be significant pent-up demand for air travel once Covid’s fully under control.

But this is a unique sector where we know that the market’s going to continue growing over the coming years and decades.

And with the UK industry now showing real leadership on decarbonising flights, and tackling noise and pollution.

It will earn the right to grow.

By becoming part of the solution to climate change, rather than part of the problem.

This crucial work has continued this year with the Jet Zero Council, launched by myself, the Business Secretary and the Prime Minister uniting industry and government to deliver a greener, brighter future for UK aviation.

So while it’s impossible to overstate the seriousness of the current Covid crisis.

Aviation will recover.

And when it does, it will be a more resilient industry.

With new technology making it cleaner.

And therefore primed to meet the needs of the years ahead.

Brexit

Alongside Covid work, we are also working hard on negotiations with the EU as we approach the end of the transition period.

You may have voted for Brexit, or voted Remain like me, but we need to ensure that what’s on the table does not cross the UK’s fundamental principles, as set out in our approach document.

As of today, significant differences remain between the UK and European Union.

But we are keen to try and bridge them in intensive talks.

We approach negotiations determined to get a deal if there is one possible.

But although the outcome remains far from certain, we are committed to ensuring that flights are able to operate safely and punctually between the UK and EU regardless of how the negotiations conclude.

And, thanks to existing international agreements, this will happen.

Closing remarks

So let me finish with a couple of important observations.

First, at a time like this, it’s more vital than ever that we continue to work together.

Over the past month, I’ve attended 5 different aviation audiences.

On technology.

Decarbonisation.

Tourism and travel.

Airlines.

And today, airport operators.

They not only provide an opportunity for me to update the industry on the latest developments in government.

But we also try and ensure that as many DfT officials as possible take part in discussions and listen in.

And finally.

I want to thank every single airport across the UK for what you’ve done this year.

The way you’ve responded to the crisis has been extraordinary.

Maintaining essential movement of goods and freight.

Providing a safe environment for customers and staff.

Doing your utmost to protect jobs.

Calmly and professionally adapting to hugely difficult circumstances.

You are incredibly important.

And the next few weeks are incredibly important too, to regaining control of infections, and reversing the spread of the virus.

And of course implementing test and relsease to shorten quarantine.

So once we emerge from the lockdown, we can roll out new systems to help people travel again.

Giving passengers confidence to book flights in safety.

And thereby getting aviation back on its feet once again and back in the air for good.

Thank you.","Department for Transport and The Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP",2020-11-09,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-to-airport-operators-association-november-2020"

Good evening and welcome to the Number Ten Coronavirus Press Conference

Before I turn to this evening’s announcements, I want to update you on the latest data


    3,532,634 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 73,726 tests carried out yesterday;
  
  
    261,184 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,625 cases since yesterday;
  
  
    8,834 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down (12%) from 10,092 this time last week;
  
And sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,914 have now died. That’s an increase of 121 fatalities since yesterday. This new figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.

And once again my deepest condolences go out to all those who have lost their loved ones before their time. We must not, and will not, forget them.

Two weeks ago, I set out our road map for the next phase of our fight against Covid 19

It is a cautious plan, informed by the evidence about what is safe, and conditional upon our continued progress against the virus.

And we are making progress. Thanks to this country’s collective efforts, the key indicators are heading in the right direction. The daily number of deaths is down, the number of new cases is down, our survey evidence suggests the infection rate is falling, and the R has not risen above one.

So just over 2 weeks ago, we moved to step 1 of our plan, encouraging those who are unable to work from home to go back to work, with new guidelines setting out how workplaces can be made COVID-secure.

At the same time, we allowed people to spend more time outdoors and to meet one member of another household outside, provided they remain 2 metres apart.

I also said we would be able to move to step 2 of our plan no earlier than Monday 1 June - a week today.

We will set out our formal assessment of the 5 tests that we set for adjusting the lockdown later this week, as part of the 3 weekly-review we are legally required to undertake by Thursday.

But because of the progress we are making, I can, with confidence, put the British people on notice of the changes we intend to introduce as we move into step 2.

And I think it is important to give that notice, so that people have sufficient time to adjust and get ready before those changes come into effect.

Yesterday I set out our intention to begin reopening nurseries and particular years in primary schools, reception, year 1, year 6, from 1 June, followed by some contact for those secondary school pupils with exams next year from 15 June. Some contact for years 10 and 12 from 15 June with their teachers.

This announcement has given schools, teachers and parents clarity about our intentions, enabling them to prepare in earnest. The Department for Education is now engaging with teaching unions, councils and school leaders to help schools get ready.

Today, I want to give the retail sector notice of our intentions to reopen shops, so they too can get ready.

So I can announce that it is our intention to allow outdoor markets to reopen from June 1, subject to all premises being made COVID-secure, as well as car showrooms, which often have significant outdoor space and where it is generally easier to apply social distancing.

We know that the transmission of the virus is lower outdoors and that it is easier to follow Covid Secure guidelines in open spaces. That means we can also allow outdoor markets to reopen in a safe way that does not risk causing a second wave of the virus.

Then, from 15 June, we intend to allow all other  non-essential retail, ranging from department stores to small, independent shops, to reopen. Again, this change will be contingent upon progress against the 5 tests and will only be permitted for those retail premises which are COVID-secure.

Today we are publishing new guidance for the retail sector detailing the measures they should take to meet the necessary social distancing and hygiene standards. Shops now have the time to implement this guidance before they reopen. This will ensure there can be no doubt about what steps they should take.

While the vast majority of businesses will want to do everything possible to protect their staff and customers, I should add that we will, of course, have the powers we need to enforce compliance where that is required.

I want people to be confident they can shop safely, provided they follow the social distancing rules for all premises.

The food retail sector has already responded fantastically well, enabling supermarkets to be kept open in a safe way – and we will learn lessons from that experience as we allow other retail to open.

These are careful but deliberate steps on the road to rebuilding our country.

And we can only take these steps thanks to what we have so far achieved together.

We will only be successful if we all remember the basics - so wash your hands, keep social distance, and isolate if you have symptoms – and get a test.

I will now hand over to Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, to take us through today’s slides.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-05-25,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-25-may-2020"

Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference. I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, our Deputy CMO.

I’ll start with the daily update on the latest data on coronavirus:

2,682,716 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK. That includes 100,678 tests carried out yesterday
  246,406 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,684 cases since yesterday
  9,408 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down 13% from this time last week
  and I’m very sad to report, of those who have tested positive for covid-19, across all settings, 34,796 have now died. That’s an increase of 160 deaths on yesterday
It goes without saying that we offer our condolences to the friends and family of every individual who has passed away during this coronavirus pandemic.

It is a challenging time and as we chart the right course over the weeks and months ahead, our overriding priority remains to save lives, whilst also preserving livelihoods and allowing people to return, over time and as and when it’s safe, to something resembling a more normal way of living.

On 11 May, we set out a road map to provide the information, the advice and the reassurance to businesses, public services, to other organisations, to employees and to citizens up and down the country.

And I want to thank everyone who is making the adjustments and engaging with us in government to forge the path ahead in a sure-footed and sustainable way.

We recognise people will have concerns and questions, and we want to work together with them, and with everyone involved to provide the necessary confidence and reassurance in the next steps that we are poised to make.

That approach is summarised in the slides which we have up on the screen.

You’ll see from Slide 1, and as people will be aware, we have established a new COVID Alert System, with 5 levels, each relating to the current level of threat posed by the virus.

The alert level is focused on the rate of infection, known as the R value, as well as the total number of coronavirus cases overall.

The alert level helps us determine the social distancing measures that we need to fight the virus. So the lower the level, the fewer or the less restrictive the measures we will need at any given time.

Since the lockdown began, at the end of March, we have been at Level 4 as indicated on the slide.

Thanks to the hard work and the huge sacrifices across the UK, and the progress that we’ve made as a result of that, particularly in relation to compliance with the social distancing measures, we are in the process of moving from Level 4 to Level 3 on the slide. We will do that through a number of very careful and deliberate steps.

Last week, the Prime Minister set out the first of 3 steps, designed to carefully modify the measures that had been put in place.

By gradually easing certain measures, we can begin to allow people to return to something resembling a more normal way of life.

The choices we make, what we are asking the British public to do, and what we’re asking them not to do, are designed to avoid the very real risk of a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS and of course risk turning a temporary economic painful moment for the country into permanent damage to the UK economy.

At every step, we’ll closely monitor the impact of easing restrictions, and in particular the impact on the spread of the virus.

It’s only by collecting and monitoring the data will we be able to take the next step, which is indicated as Step 2 on the slides, and that will be no earlier than 1 June.

I understand it’s natural for people to question why they can’t do one or other thing right now, or why certain distinctions have been made, but in reality you have to look at the package of measures as a whole, mindful of the risk to the R level and taking into account the various economic and social effects combined.

We’ve adopted a balanced approach, guided at all times by the science, and the overriding need to avoid a second peak that could overwhelm the NHS.

It’s true to say making any changes inherently comes with some risk of spreading the virus compared to simply staying at home. But it’s also true that staying in permanent lockdown is itself not sustainable on health grounds or economic grounds.

That’s why we have only eased measures where it can be done with the lowest risk possible. And that’s also why we are watching the impact of every change that we make very closely.

I know the last couple of months have been really tough for families, for businesses, for everyone up and down the UK. But it is only by keeping to the plan, sticking to the rules, even including when those rules change, that we will beat coronavirus for good.

That is why we have asked people to Stay Alert, to Control the Virus to Save Lives as we make changes to the measures in place in England and adjust the government’s advice accordingly.

For the vast majority of people, that still means staying at home as much as possible. For those that can’t work from home, they should return to work with the arrangements in place to ensure it can be safely and responsibly done.

We’ve also adjusted the advice to allow people to exercise more, to visit public outdoor spaces but staying 2 metres apart from those outside their own household.

As ever, people need to keep washing their hands regularly and carrying out the hygiene measures that we’ve advertised before.

Our advice is to wear a face covering when you are outside the home in enclosed spaces and where it’s difficult to socially distance, for example if going to the shops or travelling on public transport.

And if you or anyone in your household develops symptoms, then you still all need to self-isolate.

Now while we’re asking the public to do these things, we in government will keep ramping up the effort that we need to see to get the UK back to a more normal way of living.

With that in mind, today, the Health Secretary announced that anyone in the UK with COVID-19 symptoms can now get a test by booking online, and I can also report that we’ve now recruited over 21,000 contact tracers and call handlers in England for the implementation of our test and trace programme. That programme is absolutely key in the next steps we need to take as a country to come through this pandemic safely and responsibly.

Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. Let me start with the daily update on the latest data on coronavirus:

today, we had 1,056 new cases
  there are 395 people in critical care
  and 38 people have very sadly died
I think it’s also worth noting the week on week data, which compares Friday 5 June with Friday 12 June, just to give a sense of the trend and the progress we are making:

there were 109 fewer daily cases
  there were 161 fewer patients in critical care in our hospitals
  and 155 fewer deaths
That’s important progress on the week before as we continue, step by step, and week by week, to bring the incidence of coronavirus down.

In addition, as of today, there have been 6,866,481 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 93,163 tests carried out or posted out yesterday.

This is the progress, the evidence, the basis, on which we are able to progress along the roadmap, which the Prime Minister set out on 11 May.

We’re taking steady steps at each stage and our progress is based on strict conditions, and we’re very carefully monitoring the virus.

Thanks to the hard work of the British people, that we’ve seen the level of the virus brought down substantially.

At the same time, we’re watching the impact of every change that we make very closely so that we can monitor the trends and make sure that every step we take is as safe as possible.

On Saturday, we took measures to allow individual prayer at places of worship.

And in order to support the loneliest and most vulnerable in our society we’ve also allowed single-adult households to form ‘support bubbles’ with one other household. All those in any support bubble are able to act as if they live in the same household. Including spending time in each others’ homes without the requisite social distancing measures applying.

I know these modest steps will provide enormous relief to many people, who have been isolated from their loved ones for weeks on end now.

And today, we’re taking further steps to reopen British high streets, to get our economy motoring again, to protect jobs and livelihoods.

We will also allow outdoor attractions to open, where people can stay in their cars, like safari parks and drive-in cinemas.

As we explained back on 11 May, these are modest and careful steps.

But with each step we take, we can monitor their effect on the transmission of COVID-19 in the country, keep the virus under control as we open up step-by-step, and build public confidence in the transition that we’re making.

I say that because we can’t pretend that the virus has gone away or we’ve eliminated the virus. We know from the science, as well as international experience, that there is a risk of a second spike if we’re not very careful at this moment in time.

So we need to keep up social distancing. We need to keep building up and reinforcing our test and tracing regime. And we need continue our steady progress in repressing the virus as we try to get life back to something like normal.

BEIS and the Treasury are working closely with businesses large and small, right across the country, so that they are able to meet the COVID-secure guidelines before they reopen.

To give you a sense of what that will look like in practice, in local shops as we’ve already seen with essential retail, you’ll see one-way floor markings and signs, you’ll see hand sanitising stations, and there will be limits on the number of people in any one shop at any one time. So it’s very much a managed process.

Starting today, we’ve also made it mandatory to wear a face covering when using public transport. And we also advise people to use a face covering in any place where they can’t be sure they’ll be able to adhere to social distancing guidelines.

At the same time, we continue to incrementally bring more of our children back to school. We started with primary schools, welcoming more children back on 1 June. And today, secondary schools will start to provide some face-to-face time between teachers and students in years 10 and 12.

So that’s where we are as of today. And as I said, we’ll monitor the effect of these changes very carefully

That’s the way we can keep the downward pressure on coronavirus and build up public confidence, so we are in the best position that we possibly can be to take the third step, along our road map, which will happen no earlier than 4 July.

We’re sticking to our plan, we’re making good progress every week, and we’ll only take the necessary next steps when we can be confident it’s safe to do so.","Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, and The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP",2020-06-15,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-15-june-2020"

Coronavirus press conference 29 March 2020.

Good afternoon,

I would like to update you on our response to COVID-19.

I’m joined today by Dr Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer.

As of 9am today:

127,737 people have now been tested for the virus.

108,215 have tested negative.

19,522 have tested positive.

Of those who have contracted the virus, 1,228 have, sadly, died.

The virus is indiscriminate

It doesn’t matter who you are, where you are or how old you are.

We each have a part to play by staying at home, protecting the NHS and helping to save lives.

We all have a duty to one another to keep everyone safe.

So today I would like to give you two updates, before answering questions.

The first on the plans I have put in place to ensure that every corner of the country can confront the coronavirus epidemic.

The second on what the government is doing to shield the most vulnerable people in society.

On the first question, I have put in place in all parts of the country procedures to ensure that everywhere can be ready to move forward together. All parts of the country are now on an emergency footing.

This is an unprecedented step in peace time.

We haven’t done anything like this since the Second World War.

This means that we’re establishing strategic co-ordination centres across the whole country.

Each centre is led by gold commanders.

We are bringing together senior members of the emergency services


    the police, the fire service, the ambulance service
  
  
    with local authorities and the NHS, to lead communities through this challenging period.
  
From Cornwall to Cumbria.

And we have embedded within each of these groups members of the armed forces  – including some of the finest military planners in the world.

These groups are planning the local response to the virus.

Using their expertise, their judgement and their leadership to ensure a comprehensive, a coordinated, and consistent response across the country.

One issue that they have been helping us to coordinate and about which I know there is a lot of concern is the provision of personal protect equipment.

We simply cannot and should not ask people to be on the frontline without the right protective equipment.

We have a clear plan to ensure that those serving this country at this time have the right equipment.

We have established the National Supply Distribution Response Team and they are supported now by the armed forces and other emergency services who are working round the clock to deliver the equipment to the people who need it most:

170 million masks
  42.8 million gloves
  13.7 million aprons
  182,000 gowns
  almost 10 million items of cleaning equipment
  and 2.3 million pairs of eye protectors
all delivered to 58,000 NHS Trusts and healthcare settings including GP surgeries, pharmacies and community providers.

Every single GP practice, dental practice and community pharmacy has had a PPE delivery. All care homes, hospices and home care providers have or will shortly receive a delivery.

To NHS and social care workers, all those who rely on this equipment and to their families and loved ones watching this afternoon – we understand.

And we will not stop until we have got you the equipment that you need.

Last weekend, at this press conference, the Prime Minister and I explained why 1.5 million people who are extremely vulnerable to the virus, due to their underlying health conditions, needed to stay at home for a period of 12 weeks and avoid face to face contact.

Since then, the NHS have written to almost a million of these people and outlined the steps that they need to take to protect themselves.

We have also established a dedicated web page on GOV.UK which those in receipt of a letter should go to, to let us know whether or not they need further assistance over the course of the next 12 weeks. There is also a new phone number, which is on the letter they have or will receive shortly.

If this applies to you, I know that you will find this a very worrying time.

You will be thinking about how you can continue to access the medicine that you need, how you can get the food and other essential supplies that you rely on.

If you don’t have family or friends or neighbours nearby who you can rely on then the NHS will deliver your medicines through the community pharmacy network.

And if you register online or using the phone service that we have set up, letting us know you need support, then we will deliver food and supplies to your doorstep.

And this weekend I saw for myself first-hand the first deliveries being made.

The packages included cereal, fruit, tinned goods, teabags, biscuits, toiletries and other essentials.

The first 50,000 will have been sent out by the end of this week and we are ramping up production to send out as many as are required for as long as it takes.

If this applies to you, while you will now have to be at home for a prolonged period of time and that will be difficult, I want you to know that you are not alone. We are here to support you for as long as you need us.

We have all been hugely impressed by the commitment and the dedication of those working in social care, in local councils delivering essential public services like ensuring that the bins continue to get collected. None more so than me, as the Secretary of State for Local Government.

We all respect the 12,000 heroic former doctors and nurses and paramedics who have come back to work and been deployed this weekend.

And I think we have all been moved by the number of people who have signed up to be one of the NHS Voluntary Responders – today we can announce an extraordinary, three quarters of a million people have signed up to do that.

In every city, in every town, in every village, there is going to be work to be done and in each of us there is the power to do it.

And so please take part, please play your part, please consider your friends, your family, your neighbours when you are shopping, please call the elderly and support them.

When this is done, and it will be done, we all want to be proud of the part that we’ve played together.

Good afternoon,

Welcome to the coronavirus press conference from Downing Street.

I’m joined this afternoon by Professor Yvonne Doyle Medical Director for Public Health England and Dr Nikki Kanani Deputy Medical Director of Primary Care for NHS England.

Today’s data shows that:

1,448,010 tests for coronavirus have now been carried across Great Britain, including 69,463 tests carried out yesterday
  201,101 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 6,111 cases since yesterday
  13,615 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in Great Britain, down from 13,922 the yesterday
  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 30,076 have now died. That’s an increase of 649 fatalities since yesterday.
Behind that number is a heart-breaking loss for the loved ones of all those who have died, and once again our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends.

Professor Yvonne Doyle will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus.

But first, as Communities Secretary I would like to take this opportunity to give an update the work being done locally during the pandemic to keep people safe, to provide support people’s jobs and businesses and to prepare for the re-opening and recovery of our local economies.

That’s why it is appropriate that today we are joined by regional journalists who are doing so much to keeping people informed about how the national effort is being co-ordinated in their communities.

A free country needs a free press and the national, the regional and the local newspapers are under significant financial pressure.

I’d like to echo the words of the Culture Secretary recently in encouraging those who can, to buy a newspaper.

I have said before that the battle against coronavirus would be won in every city, town and village across the country.

This is a national effort taking place at a local level.

My department, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, has played a vital role in bringing people together to tackle the virus.

We’ve provided local authorities with over £3.2 billion during this pandemic so that they can continue to support the communities that need it through this most challenging time and respond to the immediate pressures they are facing due to coronavirus, while also protecting and preserving vital public services.

And at the start of March I established a taskforce to support Local Resilience Forums – known as LRFs – standing them up at a local level across the country, to prepare each and every community for a range of scenarios.

There are 38 LRFs in England which are made up of emergency services, a range of government agencies, health bodies and local authorities.

They are headed by the most senior and experienced local leaders of the emergency services, councils, the NHS and others who together are leading their communities through this crisis with the full support of central government.

Recognising the unprecedented challenge that we faced, I took the decision to embed within them some of the finest military planners in the world from our armed forces and I am very grateful for their work.

This combined expertise and leadership is ensuring a comprehensive, co-ordinated and consistent response across the country.

Responding to the urgent need for personal protective equipment to reach the frontline of the care sector, we’ve mobilised LRFs to help distribute PPE and thus far they have delivered over 67 million items in England alone, since early April.

Together with local councils, they are also assisting us in supporting some of the most vulnerable individuals in their communities and to date they have helped to ensure that a million boxes of food and essentials have now been delivered to those people identified by the NHS as extremely clinically vulnerable to coronavirus, the “shielded”.

With more than 290,000 boxes being distributed every week, this has been a huge team effort, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved for the role that they have played and will play in the weeks ahead.

We are also working very closely with Mayors to make sure that we have a coordinated approach to tackling coronavirus at a local level.

The government has also been determined to ensure that the vital work keeping people safe in their homes also continues.

So, with the support of the Mayors for London, the Liverpool City Region, Greater Manchester, Sheffield and the West Midlands, and others, we were able to announce the Building Safety Pledge.

These Mayors have come together because they have a number of high rise buildings with highly flammable cladding in their respective regions, and the pledge that we agreed, sends a very clear message that vital building safety work must continue, despite the coronavirus pandemic.

And we have been joined by 25 local authorities, including 18 in London, have also given their fulsome support.

As work on many of these critical sites was paused early on, it is now slowly starting to reassume as a result of this initiative.

And I would urge any building owner or contractor to do so, as soon as practicable, where it is safe to begin work once again.

Now coronavirus will not stop our mission to level-up, to unite and to unleash the potential of this country.

The Prime Minister will set out on Sunday our approach the second phase of this pandemic.

As we look ahead to supporting businesses as they are able to re-open, my department will lead our work on how our local economies can adapt, evolve, recover and grow.

I will continue to support mayors and local government leaders, who will play critical roles in this work.

Every local economy now needs a plan to re-start and recover.

We will be informing those plans with our own detailed work in areas such as:

How workplaces, from factories to construction sites to offices can be adapted.
  How outdoor spaces, leisure and businesses, from parks, to high streets, to markets can be managed.
  And how public transport networks, from the tube, to trams, to buses, can operate.
In each case, guided by scientific and medical advice, we want to ensure appropriate and safe social distancing, providing the public with the confidence to return to work, and to return to public spaces, to public transport and to school, knowing that it’s always safe to do so.

We are considering how we can create more room in the town centre for pedestrians.

How we can make it easier to cycle or walk to work.

And we will work with towns and places whose economies have been hardest hit intensively as the recovery begins.

And our commitment to infrastructure investment remains undimmed.

For example, over two thirds of HS2 sites are open.

We want infrastructure and construction work to begin again wherever it is safe to do so.

It is clear to everyone that the pandemic is putting huge pressure on economies the world over.

And there is no denying the challenges lie ahead in our own country.

But we cannot, and will not, let this pandemic halt our work to improve connectivity, to provide vital social and cultural infrastructure and to boost economic growth across the regions.

That’s is how we will begin to rebuild and recover from this national emergency.

We are working to ensure the right support is available to local businesses.

And last week high street businesses began to receive the £22 million package designed to mitigate some of the effects of coronavirus.

With grants of us to £25,000 being paid into bank accounts of those business.

And of course the 100 towns benefiting from our £3.6 billion Towns Fund will continue to receive our support.

And we will be working at pace with them in the months ahead.

Local authorities have now paid out over £8.6 billion in grants to around 700,000 businesses.

As Local Government Secretary I’d like to congratulate those councils that have worked extremely hard sometimes around the clock to get those grants out to the businesses that desperately need them.

I’d like to congratulate Chichester, Ealing and Hyndburn councils who are the three highest performing councils so far in England.

Businesses are also receiving discounts of almost £10 billion on their rates bills in response to COVID-19, with the hardest hit by the pandemic, such as shops, cafes and pubs, paying no business rates whatsoever this financial year.

Together with existing reliefs, this means that 1.1 million ratepayers are no longer paying business rates this year.

This week the Chancellor and I announced an additional 5% uplift – up to £617 million – available to local councils to fund small businesses that rent space in shared offices, industrial units or innovation centres, as well as regular market traders, B&Bs that pay council tax rather than business rates and also to support small charities.

And local councils will now how have flexibility to make pragmatic decisions to keep those business going so they can bounce back once they are able to do so.

Moving forward, our mission is to do everything we can to help people get back to work safely, to reunite friends and family and reintroduce the things that make life worth living in a safe way, as soon as it is safe to do so.

Finally, on Friday, we will celebrating as a country the 75th anniversary of VE Day.

My department had been helping to plan some of the public celebrations, but we know that sadly we will now all need to mark this important occasion from home instead.

Cabinet colleagues have been speaking with veteran organised by The Royal British Legion and I had the pleasure earlier this week of speaking to Leslie, a 98-year-old World War Two veteran, on the phone.

Leslie was full of warmth and wisdom, telling me how he spent VE Day in Siena having fought his way through North Africa and Italy, and how he would be spending Friday, more sedately, celebrating, at home.

As he said to me, that as we rebuilt and recovered then, he is certain we’ll do so again this year.","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government and The Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP",2020-05-06,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/communities-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-6-may-2020"

Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street’s daily coronavirus briefing.

Before taking questions from members of the public and the media, I’d like to start by sharing the latest data.

First slide please.

The first slide shows the information on infections, and the data published by the Office for National Statistics this morning shows the number of people who had coronavirus in England fell from around 139,000 between 3 and 16 May to around 53,000 between 17 and 30 May.

That’s represented in percentage terms in this right-hand chart. It demonstrates that the percentage of the population testing positive has been falling consistently over recent weeks. SAGE have confirmed that the R across the whole of the UK is between 0.7 and 0.9.

The ONS survey also estimated the number of new coronavirus infections which stands at 39,000 per week which is equivalent to around 5,600 per day. And this is lower than the similar estimate made last week. So these are encouraging trends about the reducing spread of coronavirus across the country.

This slide shows progress on testing and the number of new confirmed cases. In total 5,214,277 tests have been carried out including 207,231 tests yesterday. And these data on tests include both the swab tests to find out if you have coronavirus and also the antibody tests, which stand at just over 40,000 antibody tests a day.

The antibody tests find out if you have had the virus. And if you have had the virus you can help make a difference because by donating your plasma from your blood that has your antibodies in it then you can help somebody who is currently suffering in hospital with coronavirus.

I did this earlier today. I gave my antibodies and the process is simple, it’s straightforward. If you have had coronavirus, if you go to the NHS Blood and Transplant website NHSBT then you too can donate your antibodies and help protect somebody who is currently in hospital with coronavirus. And I’d encourage anybody who can do that to step forward.

The chart also shows that the number of confirmed cases is 1,650 yesterday which brings the total of confirmed cases, confirmed by swab tests, to 283,311.

This slide shows the data from hospitals. There were 694 admissions, new admissions, with COVID-19 on the latest data, which has fallen over the last week. Those data include England, Wales and Northern Ireland. They don’t include Scotland. And also the bottom data which is across the whole UK, shows the number of people in ventilator beds has fallen from 751 on 28 May, a week ago, down to 571. This is down from a peak of over 3000 on 12 April.

Slide 4 shows the regional breakdown of people in hospital. And it shows that over 7,000 people remain in hospital, 7,080 to be precise. But this is down 15% from 8,285 a week ago and a peak of over 20,000 in April. 
The final slide shows the number of people who have sadly lost their lives. And this number stands at 40,261 on the latest information, which is 357 higher than yesterday.

These slides demonstrate, although the past few months have been a time of sorrow for so many people, because of these deaths is not a statistic but the loss of a loved one for so many families. The slides also show that we have made a progress in our fight against this virus. But they also show that there is so much more to do.

It shows that we must always remain vigilant.

Especially when it comes to protecting our NHS, which has been at the front line of the battle.

And of course thanks to an enormous national effort, we protected the NHS and prevented it being overwhelmed which in turn saved lives.

And today I want to set out further that we are taking further steps to protect the NHS and especially around face coverings and face masks.

Yesterday, the Secretary of State for Transport announced that face coverings will become mandatory on public transport from June 15 – with a few specific exceptions – for instance those with breathing difficulties.

This doesn’t mean surgical masks, which need to be kept for clinical settings, but the kind of face masks that you can easily make at home – in fact there’s a good guide on GOV.UK.

As more people go back to work, and the passenger numbers start to increase, so face coverings on transport are more important.

Likewise, as the NHS reopens right across the country, it is critically important to stop the spread amongst staff, patients and visitors too.

So today we are setting out that all hospital visitors and outpatients will need to wear face coverings.

One of the things that we’ve learnt is that those in hospitals, those that are working in hospital are more likely to catch coronavirus, whether they work in a clinical setting or not.

And so to offer even greater protection, we are also providing new guidance for NHS staff in England which will come into force again on the 15 June, and all hospital staff will be required to wear Type 1 or 2 surgical masks.

And this will cover all staff working in hospital.

And it will apply at all times, not just when they are doing their life-saving work on the frontline. It will apply in all areas, except in those areas designated as covid-secure workplaces.

And of course where PPE guidance recommends more stringent protection, of course, that remains in place.

We are upgrading this guidance to make sure that even as this virus comes under control, as we saw the falling incidences across the country, our hospitals are a place of care and of safety.

We have also strengthened infection control in care homes. And we are working with the social care sector on how this approach can apply appropriately in social care too.

It’s about protecting our NHS and social care, which means protecting our colleagues who work in the NHS and in social care.

And I want to say this to you all my colleagues in health and social care.

As we get this virus under control, it is so important that we stamp out new infections and outbreaks.

And of course in health and care you do this brilliantly all the time - and coronavirus is no exception.

That means that if one of your team tests positive, you have to follow the isolation advice.

The natural impulse of course of anyone in care, in the NHS is the thing you can best do is be there to help. To be there for the patient.

But if you have the virus, or are at risk of having the virus, the best thing you can do for them, as well as yourself, is to isolate at home.

And this means that social distancing in the workplace also must be reiterated and it matters just as much as anywhere else.

And I know that social distancing and self-isolation can cause big logistical challenges, and we will support you in doing what is right and necessary.

All of us have a role to play here.

And the last thing I want to say is this, ahead of this weekend, when I know there are plans for further protests, I want to say something to you as Health Secretary.

Like so many, I am appalled by the death of George Floyd and I understand why people are deeply upset.

But we are still facing a health crisis and coronavirus remains a real threat.

And the reason that it is vital that people stick to the rules this weekend is to protect themselves and their family from this horrific disease.

So please for the safety of your loved ones, do not attend large gatherings - including demonstrations - of more than 6 people.

We all need to stay alert, control the virus and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-06-05,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-june-2020"

Opening remarks

Good afternoon.

And welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.

I’m joined today by Sir Peter Hendy, Chair of Network Rail. Peter was Commissioner of transport for the London Olympics and the person who has helped oversee the restart of our transport system.

Let me start by updating you on the latest information from the government’s COBR data file.

First slide please….

This slide shows data on the use of different types of transport.

These graphs show significant falls in the use public transport – rail, buses, the tube in London – even before lockdown was introduced on 23 March. This is welcome, it shows the public have responded positively to our requests to avoid public transport wherever possible.

The use of motor vehicles fell substantially initially and has since risen steadily, though not back to the levels seen in mid-March. Again, this is what we would expect as we have introduced some easements to the lockdown and encouraged people to return to work.

One form of transport which has seen a significant increase is cycling – it is great to see people switching to a clean, green mode of transport with significant public health benefits.

Second slide please…

This slide shows tests and cases.

The number of tests carried out or posted out in the UK has risen past 5 million for the first time, to 5,005,565. This includes a record 220,057 tests carried out or posted out yesterday.

281,661 people have tested positive, an increase of 1,805 cases since yesterday. The graph shows a steadily falling number of identified cases on a 7-day rolling average, despite the increase in testing.

Third slide please…

This slide shows the latest data from hospitals.

505 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England on 2 June, up marginally from 475 a week ago, but down from the peak of 3,121 on 2 April.

604 coronavirus patients are in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 783 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.

Fourth slide please…

This slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country.

There are now 7,312 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 15% from 8,558 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,699 on 12 April.

As the graphs show, while there is some variation, most nations and regions of the UK are broadly following a similar pattern.

Last slide please…

This slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus.

Across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 39,904. That’s an increase of 176 fatalities since yesterday.

When measured by a 7-day rolling average, the daily number of deaths currently stands at 241, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.

These figures are a reminder that COVID-19 still represents a very real threat…

That the fight still goes on to defeat it…

And that there are tragically still too many people across the country who are losing loved ones.

Our thoughts are with them all.

Transport leading green recovery

As we’ve made clear in recent weeks, our road to recovery must be carefully and cautiously managed.

Most importantly, we must avoid a second infection spike.

This careful, deliberate approach has been central to the restart of public transport.

In advance of previous easing of the total lockdown, we ensured transport availability was increased to allow for adequate social distancing.

In addition, we also announced measures to help people choose other forms of transport.

For example, with a record £2 billion investment in cycling and walking…

As well as the acceleration of e-scooter trials, brought forward to the end of this month.

Meticulous planning – alongside the considerable effort of passengers avoiding public transport – has worked well so far.

There has been an absence of crowding, even as passenger numbers have ticked up… partly thanks to the work of Sir Peter.

But these challenges are about to increase.

We expect – conditions permitting – that the next easing of restrictions will occur on Monday 15 June.

Non-essential shops will re-open and some children will return to secondary school, if it is safe to do so. That means there will be more pressure on our public transport.

To help meet that demand, we’re ramping up services on buses, trains and trams; with substantial government funding.

But still we need to do more.

So today I want to highlight measures to help keep us all safer, and reduce the risks of the Coronavirus coming back.

There are three points I want to highlight.

Work from home if possible

First, let me reiterate – and this is important – if you can work from home, you should continue to do so.

If you cannot work from home, you should avoid public transport wherever possible.

And if you must use public transport, you should follow the guidance, including avoiding the rush hour.

Updated guidance – face coverings

Second, I can announce that, as of Monday 15 June, face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.

That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home.

There’ll be exceptions to the rule for very young children, disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.

But broadly, as we come through this phase, we’re doing what many other countries have asked transport users to do.

And as passenger numbers increase, and we expect this trend to continue, we need to ensure every precaution is taken, on buses, trains, aircraft and ferries.

With more people using transport, the evidence suggests that wearing a face covering offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread of the virus.

A face covering helps protect our fellow passengers. It is something that we can each do to help each other.

And whilst it also remains true that measures like maintaining social distance and washing your hands remain most critical, we also know that, on public transport, keeping two-metres apart is not always possible, all of the time.

Indeed, the guidance explicitly recognises this fact.

So, when more people return to the network, from 15 June onwards, they will be required to wear a face covering on our transport network.

We’ll make these rules changes under the National Rail Conditions of Travel and the Public Service Vehicle Regulations for buses.

This will mean you can be refused travel if you don’t comply and could be fined.

Alongside transport operators, this will be enforced by the British Transport Police, as necessary.

But I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face-covering helps to protect others, and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.

Of course, frontline staff – those in contact with passengers, doing such an important job at this crucial time – will also need to wear face coverings.

In the coming days, the government will work with unions, who have been supportive for which I am grateful, transport operators and police to ensure they have the supplies they need to be safe and provide reassurance to the public.

These measures apply in England, and we are working with the devolved administrations ahead of implementation.

Active and alternatives to public transport

Third, to ease pressure on public transport, I want to update you on the measures we’re taking to boost alternative ways to travel.

Now that vehicle showrooms are open again, there’s a growing range of electric cars, mopeds, motorbikes on sale…

And as our economy gets moving, their popularity will continue to increase.

Later this month we’ll be introducing the Fix Your Bike Voucher – worth 50 quid.

We’ll have hundreds-of-thousands more bikes roadworthy as a result of this programme.

Then there’s the Cycle To Work scheme which enables employees to buy a tax free bike – an effective saving of 25 – 39%.

And that scheme has been extended to cover e-bikes as well, meaning that cyclists can cover longer distances by getting assistance on those uphill stretches.

And this is a great time to start using them…

As we redesign our street landscape to cope with millions more cyclists and pedestrians in the months ahead.

The evidence is that commuters are already responding…

Despite fewer people travelling overall during this crisis, we’ve seen around a 100% increase in weekday cycling.

And at weekends, that increase has been up to around 200%, compared to pre-COVID-19 levels.

We want to use this recovery to permanently change the way we travel.

With huge levels of investment…..

We’re bringing forward green transport improvements that otherwise would have taken years, if not decades, to achieve.

In the short-term, whilst there’s still a threat from the virus, they’ll help millions of people avoid public transport journeys.

And in the longer term, they’ll help transform our country into a lower carbon, cleaner and greener place to live.

Conclusion

Our history shows us how quickly we can adapt as a nation.

Just as we did nearly 200 years ago, when Britain invented the railway…

And just as we did in the 20th century, when we embraced the motor car…

And then in the 1950s, when we launched the first passenger jet airliner, coincidentally designed and built in my Hatfield constituency.

Each of these transport revolutions was triggered by a unique alignment of people and events.

Brilliant engineers and entrepreneurs.

Cutting-edge new technologies.

Supportive governments.

And the needs of citizens.

Combining to bring about important change.

And now we stand on the verge of a new transport revolution…

This time, not limited to one particular means of travel, but rather to all forms of transport…

A green transport revolution…

Which will help us rebuild a stronger, more prosperous Britain, as well as a cleaner and healthier one.

First let me first run you through the latest data on our coronavirus response.

4,786,219 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK, including 171,829 tests yesterday.

279,856 people have tested positive, and that’s an increase of 1,871 cases since yesterday.

7,485 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down 16% from 8,921 this time last week.

And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 39,728 have now died. That’s an increase of 359 fatalities since yesterday and once again we are with their families in mourning.

Now that the rate of transmission in the UK has significantly fallen from its peak, we need to take steps to manage the flare-ups and stop the virus re-emerging in the UK.

I want to update you on the progress we are making on three fronts to prevent a second wave of infections that could overwhelm the NHS.

First, we have set up NHS Test and Trace in order to identify, contain and control the virus in the UK, thereby reducing its spread.

As we move to the next stage of our fight against coronavirus, we will be able to replace national lockdowns with individual isolation and, if necessary, local action where there are outbreaks.

NHS Test and Trace will be vital to controlling the spread of the virus. It’s how we will be able to protect our friends and family from infection, and protect our NHS.

It does this by identifying anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive, and asking them to isolate for 14 days in order to avoid unknowingly infecting others.

The system clearly relies on everyone playing their part.

So I want to stress again today: we need you to get a test if you have coronavirus symptoms – a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a loss of taste or smell.

There is plenty of capacity and everyone with symptoms is eligible, everyone with symptoms, so please order a test from nhs.uk/coronavirus as soon as you develop symptoms.

And we need you to isolate yourself if a contact tracer tells you that you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive.

NHS Test and Trace started operating a week ago. And already thousands of people are isolating who wouldn’t have been doing so before this service was introduced. They are thereby protecting others and reducing the spread of the virus.

So while we are going to all these efforts here in the UK to control the virus, we must also ensure we don’t reimport the virus from abroad.

So the second action I want to update you on is the introduction of public health measures at the border.

Today the Home Secretary has brought forward the legislation needed to establish the new regime from Monday.

And I want to explain the reasons for introducing these measures now.

When coronavirus started to spread around the world, first from Wuhan and then from northern Italy and other areas, we introduced enhanced monitoring at the border in an attempt to stop the virus from gaining a foothold in the UK.

These measures applied, at various different times, to arrivals from China, Japan, Iran and Italy, and required people with symptoms travelling from those countries to self-isolate for 14 days.

However, once community transmission was widespread within the UK, cases from abroad made up a tiny proportion of the total. At the same time you’ll remember that international travel plummeted as countries around the world went into lockdown. So as a result, measures at the border were halted because they made little difference at the time in our fight against the virus.

Now that we’re getting the virus under control in the UK, there’s a risk cases from abroad begin once again to make up a greater proportion of overall cases. We therefore need to take steps now to manage that risk of these imported cases triggering a second peak.

So just as we are asking people already in the UK to isolate for 14 days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace, we’re also asking those arriving from abroad to isolate so that they don’t unknowingly spread the virus.

There will be some exemptions for a limited number of people who need to cross the border, such as those engaged directly in the fight against coronavirus or who provide essential services.

And we will review how the policy is working after three weeks. And of course we will explore the possibility of international travel corridors with countries that have low rates of infection - but only when the evidence shows that it is safe to do so.

The third point I want to make today is we need effective international action to reduce the impact of the virus across the globe.

This is the moment really for humanity to unite in the fight against the disease.

Health experts have warned that if coronavirus is left to spread in developing countries, that could lead to future waves of infection coming back and reaching the UK.

While our amazing NHS has been there for everyone in this country who needs it, many developing countries have healthcare systems which are ill-prepared to manage this pandemic.

So to ensure that the world’s poorest countries have the support they need to slow the spread of the virus, tomorrow I will open the Global Vaccine Summit.

Hosted by the UK, and will bring together more than 50 countries and leading figures like Bill Gates to raise at least $7.4 billion for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Over the next five years – with the UK’s support as Gavi’s biggest donor – this Vaccine Alliance aims to immunise a further 300 million children in the poorest countries against deadly diseases like polio, typhoid and measles – again saving millions of lives.

This support for routine immunisations will shore up poorer countries’ healthcare systems to deal with coronavirus – and so help to stop the global spread and, as I say, prevent a second wave of the virus reaching the UK.

This virus has shown how connected we are. We’re fighting an invisible enemy. And no one is safe frankly until we are all safe.

And again, of course this is all contingent upon each of us continuing to do our bit.

And as I never tire of telling you

Let us not forget the basics.

Wash your hands regularly and for 20 seconds, wash your hands.

Do not gather in groups of more than six outside.

Always observe social distancing, keeping 2 metres apart from anyone outside your household.

And I want to stress one final point which may be relevant today as the weather threatens I think to take a turn for the worse. Some of you may be tempted to move the gatherings you’ve been enjoying outdoors, indoors, out of the rain.

I really urge you – don’t do that.

We relaxed the rules on meeting outside for a very specific reason – because the evidence shows that the risks of transmission are much lower outdoors, much lower outdoors.

And the risks of passing on the virus are significantly higher indoors, which is why gatherings inside other people’s homes are still prohibited.

Breaking these rules now could undermine and reverse all the progress that we’ve made together.

I have no doubt that that won’t happen, I’ve no doubt that that won’t happen. I think the British public will continue to show the same resolve in fighting the virus as they have throughout the outbreak.

We will get through this if we stay alert, control the virus, and in doing so save lives.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-06-03,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-coronavirus-press-conference-3-june-2020"

Good afternoon and welcome to today’s briefing where I’m joined by Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientific advisor.

I want to begin by updating you on the latest data relating to the coronavirus outbreak.

2,772,552 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 89,784 tests carried out yesterday
  248,818 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,412 cases since yesterday
  10,025 people are currently in hospital with the coronavirus in the UK, that’s down 17% from the 11,716 this time last week
  And sadly, of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 35,341 have now died. That’s an increase of 545 fatalities since yesterday
And of course our thoughts are with the families of all of those who have lost their lives to this virus.

Before I turn to some of the work that Defra is doing to ensure that we are able to harvest this year’s farm harvest I want to remind people of the details of the next phase of our fight against the coronavirus.

Firstly on slide one, as you can see, in order to monitor our progress we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System, with five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus.

The alert level will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.

And in turn that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place.

The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures.

Throughout the period of lockdown, which started on March 23rd, we were at Level 4.

Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in careful steps.

Turning now to slide two, We have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life - but crucially do this while avoiding what would be a second peak that overwhelms the NHS.

After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R value and the number of infections, and all the available data, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.

So in step one, as the Prime Minister announced last week:

*Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going to work.
*People can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as they like.

Finally, turning to slide three, having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, our clear advice is to stay alert, control the virus, and save lives.

And staying alert means:

Staying at home as much as possible and working from home if this is possible
  Limiting contact with other people and where contact is made with other people, keeping your distance
  Washing your hands regularly and also staying at home and self-isolating if you or a household member show symptoms of the virus
My final point today relates to the availability of labour this year for the farming harvest. Every year large numbers of people come from countries such as Romania and Bulgaria to take part in the harvest, harvesting crops such as strawberries, and salads and vegetables.

We estimate that probably only about a third of the people that would normally come are already here and small numbers may continue to travel. But one thing is clear and that is that this year we will need to rely on British workers to lend a hand to help bring that harvest home.

Over the last couple of months we have been working with industry on a plan to support and help people taking second jobs, particularly those who are furloughed, and we have launched a new ‘Pick for Britain’ website that enables people to go online, check (what job issues there are) what job availability there is and to marry up job opportunities from growers and employers with those people seeking a second job, particularly those that are furloughed.

We believe that those who are furloughed may be getting to the point that they want to lend a hand and play their part. They may be wanting to get out and they may be wanting to supplement their income with an additional job and if they do feel that way I would urge them to visit that website and to look at the opportunities that are there.

I will now turn to Angela McLean who will give you further updates on the coronavirus.","Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and The Rt Hon George Eustice MP",2020-05-19,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/environment-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-19-may-2020"

Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s daily coronavirus briefing. I’m joined today by Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England.

And, before I outline the latest on coronavirus and the work that we’re doing as a government to tackle it, I wanted to briefly update you about the Prime Minister’s condition.

It’s great news that the Prime Minister has been discharged from hospital and is now continuing his recovery at Chequers. I hope everyone has seen his message of love, and thanks to all those who’ve supported his recovery and to the NHS colleagues who have cared for him so brilliantly at St Thomas’s Hospital. I know that they have cared for him as they would care for anybody in this country and it’s one of the things that makes me so proud ‒ that the NHS is there for us all and can give its very best to every single person and has been able to throughout this crisis.

I know that all of his thoughts are with those affected by this illness, and of course the government is working constantly through our coronavirus action plan. And the aim is to protect life and to protect the NHS, both by slowing the spread of the virus to flatten the curve and by ensuring that the NHS is always there for you and always has more than enough capacity to meet the demands that are placed on it.

Today marks a sombre day in the impact of this disease as we join the list of countries who have seen more than 10,000 deaths related to coronavirus.

The fact that over 10,000 people have now lost their lives to this invisible killer demonstrates just how serious coronavirus is and why the national effort that everyone is engaged in is so important.

According to the most recent figures, 282,374 people have now been tested for coronavirus.  84,279 have tested positive. Across Great Britain, the number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms is now 19,945 and, of those who’ve contracted the virus, 10,612 have tragically died. Our sincere condolences are with all of them, with their families, their friends. Their grief is our grief, and their stories will not be forgotten.

On Friday, I said that staying at home this Easter weekend would be a major test of the nation’s resolve. And I am pleased to say that the nation is rising to this challenge. I know that for some people this has been extra tough, if you’re at home with children, if you can’t visit relatives because they’re shielding, if you’re unable to go to church on this most important day for Christians. Your steadfast commitment to following the social distancing rules is making a difference. Thank you for the part that you are playing in helping to protect lives at this critical time in our nation’s history.

But we cannot be complacent, not when there is so much is at stake, so, please, keep going, stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.

Today, I want to provide an update on the work we’re doing to slow the spread of the virus and to build capacity. The latest figures show that in Great Britain we have 2,295 spare critical care beds, up 150 from yesterday.

So, throughout this crisis, with all challenges that we’ve been dealing with, all the operational difficulties and all of the logistics, we have always been able to provide the very best of care to everybody who needs it through the NHS.

At the start of the crisis, people said that the NHS would be overwhelmed and we’ve seen that, and we’ve seen the risk of that, elsewhere, but not here. And that is because of the action that a huge number of people have taken, the incredible work of so many.

There is more spare capacity now for critical care than there was when coronavirus first hit our shores. And this is before the Nightingale hospitals come on stream. London’s has opened, and we’re already in process of building 6 more around England.

This critical expansion is partly because we have a record number of ventilators, 9,775, and partly because we have record numbers of returners coming back and rejoining the NHS. Over 5,000 former staff are now back on the NHS frontline and over 36,000 have come forward to enlist. And this bolstered capacity has been backed by substantial financial support. As the Chancellor has said, whatever our NHS and vital public services need during this time, they will have.

But of course there is always more that must be done. So, we’re increasing the amount of PPE and I’m glad to say that there are now record amounts in the system. And we need the right amounts of medicine too, and I can assure everyone that we’re working very closely with the pharmaceutical supply chain and hospital pharmacies so that the right medicines are there to treat people. And I’m glad to see the reassurances that have been provided today that everybody can have the medicines they need in order to get the care that they need.

And when we debate the operational challenges we face, I want to be transparent about every single one. Let us not forget that the core measure of NHS capacity, which is what matters to you when you or one of your loved ones needs it, is whether you can get the best care if you catch coronavirus. On that, we are succeeding and in fact succeeding more with each passing day.

I also wanted to provide a brief update on the work on PPE, which is so important for NHS and social care staff. I pay tribute to our health and care staff who, this weekend, just like every weekend, are giving the best possible care. On Thursdays, on streets, front doors and balconies up and down the country, we’ve seen the esteem with which the whole nation holds our carers, the people who make the NHS and social care what it is, and we owe it to them to get them the equipment that they need.

On Friday, we published a comprehensive PPE plan, which is based on everyone using the right PPE according to the agreed guidelines. And, daily, we’re delivering millions of items to the frontline.

Now I know that there have also been questions about gowns. In the last 2 days, 121,000 gowns have been delivered around the country, and more are going out today and in the week to come. So, we’re working very hard to resolve all of these individual logistical challenges.

It’s worth saying that the average time for dealing with PPE queries has gone down from 6 days in March to an average of 2 and half days over the past week. And, since we published the plan last week, I’m delighted with the sheer number of businesses that have come forward to help with our PPE effort, even over the bank holiday weekend. Thank you to all of you and to all those that are involved in this enormous, herculean effort on PPE, and I know that we’ll see many more businesses coming forward and I look forward to it.

Testing, of course, has a huge role in our response and we have discussed repeatedly testing at these press conferences. I’m pleased to say that 42,812 NHS and social care staff and their families have now been tested. And, as we ramp up our ability to test in large numbers, we also need to make sure we have the ability to trace contacts just as effectively.

And so, today, I wanted to outline the next step: a new NHS app for contact tracing. If you become unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus, you can securely tell this new NHS app, and the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users that you’ve been in significant contact with over the past few days, even before you had symptoms, so that they know and can act accordingly.

All data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards and would only be used for NHS care and research and we won’t hold it any longer than it’s needed. And, as part of our commitment to transparency, we will be publishing the source code too. We’re already testing this app and, as we do this, we’re working closely with the world’s leading tech companies and renowned experts in clinical safety and digital ethics so that we can get this right.

I want to thank all of these world-leading experts who’ve been involved. The more people who get involved, then the better informed our response to coronavirus will be and the better we can protect the NHS.

Her Majesty the Queen spoke for all of us, as she so often does, when she said that Easter is not cancelled and that we need it now more than ever. This is an uncertain Easter for so many people. At a time when we normally come physically together, we must stay apart. It runs counter to every human instinct and every intuition that we possess, but we must persevere.

Because, if we follow the rules and slow the spread of the virus, then each new day will bring us closer to normal life. And we can enjoy Easters to come, safe in the knowledge that, when it mattered, we did our bit and rose to the challenge. And we put our loved ones, we put our NHS staff and we put our local communities first.

So please, this Easter, stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-04-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-12-april-2020"

Good afternoon, welcome to the government’s daily briefing on coronavirus.

I am pleased to be joined by Paul Lincoln, Director General of our Border Force, and Patrick Vallance, our Chief Scientific Advisor.

First, I will update you on the latest daily figures.

3,231,921 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 140,497 tests carried out yesterday.
  254,195 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3287 cases since yesterday.
  9,307 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down 14% from 10,781 this time last week.
  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36 393 have now died. That’s an increase of 351 fatalities since yesterday.
All our thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies remain with all those who have lost loved ones.

At this time of national emergency, it is crucial that we remain alert to save countless more lives.

That means doing everything in our power to control this terrible disease – taking the right action, at the right time, to prevent a deadly second wave.

That is why I am today announcing the next step in our cross-government approach – and these include temporary public health restrictions at the border.

Let me explain why we are bringing forward these measures as other restrictions finally start to ease, following two hard months of lockdown.

The answer why is simple: it is to protect that hard-won progress and prevent a devastating resurgence and a second wave of the virus.

We are following the science and introducing public health measures that are supported by SAGE.

This will require international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days – that is the incubation period of the virus – so that if people have become infected overseas, we can limit the spread of the virus at home.

And as we are taking this action, we are taking it at a time when it will be most effective.

Passenger arrivals have been down by 99% compared to the previous year.

Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases, triggering a resurgence of this deadly disease.

As the transmission rate across the UK falls, and the number of travellers arriving in the UK begins to increase, imported cases could begin to pose a larger and increased threat.

This is because they could become a higher proportion of the overall number of infections in the UK and therefore increase the spread of the disease.

So, with far fewer people being infected in this country and the public having worked so hard to bring the R number down, any new arrivals entering the country with the disease during this next phase will have a much bigger impact – potentially causing a second wave.

This is of course a different story from when domestic transmission was at its peak and when overseas travel was at an all time low.

Led by the Prime Minister, the whole government has worked together across all departments including with the devolved administrations to develop these measures.

We do not take these steps lightly.

This is extremely challenging and these are difficult times for the entire nation as our freedoms have been sadly, but necessarily, curtailed.

We do not underestimate how hard the new restrictions will be for people up and down the country, and also those who have already sacrificed so much to help beat and drive down the spread of coronavirus.

I know that families both at home and abroad are desperate to be reunited.

But, by taking these steps, we could save many more lives - making it possible for more friends and family to be safely together in the future.

We also recognise how hard these changes will be for our travel and leisure sectors who are already struggling in these unprecedented times.

Across government, we continue to work with them and support what is an incredibly dynamic sector to find new ways to reopen international travel and tourism in a safe and responsible way.

We will review these temporary public health measures every three weeks to ensure they remain the right ones for our road map to recovery.

And these measures will be introduced from 8 June, so that people arriving into the UK will be required to self-isolate for 14 days, except those on a short list of exemptions.

Arrivals will also be required to provide contact and address details to help trace them should we need to.

And given the amazing public spirit and the level of compliance we have seen so far we expect the vast majority of people to do the right thing and comply with these new requirements.

We know that the vast majority of people will continue to play their part and act responsibly, to control the spread of this virus and stop a second wave.

But we will not allow a small, reckless minority to endanger us all – so there will be penalties for those who break these mandatory measures.

Border Force will be on the frontline of implementing the changes with spot checks as people arrive in the UK.

Paul Lincoln, Director General of Border Force, will shortly provide an update on the steps people will need to take.

I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank our border officers and staff for the role they will play, and for all they are doing to protect our nation at this deeply challenging time.

We are working across all four nations of the UK to make these public health measures work, but I will now turn to the enforcement approach that is being taken here in England.

We will conduct spot checks by mid June to ensure people are self-isolating.

And those from overseas who refuse to comply, could be refused entry.

Public Health England will set up an assurance service to contact people at random to ensure they understand the requirements and are self-isolating.

And our outstanding police will continue as they have done so diligently across the country, to engage, explain and encourage people to follow the rules.

We will empower them to use enforcement as a last resort.

So anyone breaking their 14-day quarantine could face a one thousand pound fixed penalty notice.

And, ultimately, there could be potential prosecution and an unlimited fine for failure to comply with these sanctions.

We will keep these penalties under review and will be unafraid to increase them if that is required.

But have no doubt: we are taking these measures at the right time because we are serious about saving lives and controlling the virus.

We will be guided by the science and the health of the public and the country will always come first, which is why we are implementing these restrictions at the border now.

Our absolute priority remains to stop the spread of this infection, to save lives and to stop and prevent a dangerous second wave of this virus.

That also means supporting our NHS and making short-term sacrifices together, to stop coronavirus taking more lives.

I will now handover to Paul Lincoln, from Border Force, who will provide an operational update and also talk about the measures and how they will be implemented.","Home Office, Border Force, and The Rt Hon Priti Patel MP",2020-05-22,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/home-secretarys-opening-statement-to-the-governments-daily-briefing-on-coronavirus"

Opening remarks

Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.

I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam.

Latest data

Let me start by updating you on the latest information from the Government’s COBR data file.

Through our monitoring and testing programme, as of today:

2,219,281 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including a new record of 126,064 tests carried out yesterday
  233,151 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,446 cases since yesterday
  11,041 people are in hospital with COVID-19, down 14% from a week ago, when 12,802 patients were hospitalised
  and sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, 33,614 have now died - that’s an increase of 428 fatalities since yesterday.
This new figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.

Our deepest sympathies go out to the families and friends as the nation battles to defeat the disease.

Main content

Today I’m going to set out how – whilst the country has been at a virtual standstill – this downtime has been used to fix and upgrade the nation’s road and rail infrastructure, along with plans to help our economy bounce back.

But before I set out today’s transport announcements, let me briefly remind you of the government’s roadmap out of this crisis.

As you know, we have established a new COVID Alert System, with five levels - based primarily on the R value and the number of cases.

Throughout the lockdown, we have been at Level 4.

Thanks to the British people, we have brought the R down and we can now begin moving carefully to Level 3.

From this week we’re at Step 1, meaning that:

those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work
  you can now spend time outdoors and exercise as much as you like
  you can meet one person who’s not part of your household outside, provided you stay 2 metres apart
Step 2 - from June 1, at the earliest, as long as it’s safe, we aim to allow:

primary schools to reopen for some pupils, in smaller class sizes
  non-essential retail to start to reopen
  cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed doors, without crowds
And then Step 3 – no earlier than July 4, and again, only if the data says it’s safe, we aim to allow:

more businesses to open, including those offering personal care, those in the leisure sector, together with places of worship
We can control this virus if we stay alert.

But what does staying alert actually mean?

Staying alert, for the vast majority of people still means staying at home as much as possible, and working from home if you can.

But it also means:

limiting contact with other people
  keeping your distance if you go out
  washing your hands regularly
  wearing a face covering in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant - for example on public transport
  and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate
If everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections.

This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.

Transport context

Today I want to update you on the measures we’re taking to speed up our economic recovery while keeping people safe.

For 2 months, we’ve remained in lockdown, travelling as little as possible, and in doing so, the whole country has protected the NHS and helped reduce the number of COVID infections.

But as we begin making tentative steps towards restarting our economy and people in some sectors who can’t work from home begin to return to their workplaces, it is clear that transport has a critical role to play.

Last Saturday, I explained why it’s our civic duty to avoid public transport, if at all possible.

Because, even when we have 100% of services up and running, there may only be socially-distanced space available for 1 in 10 passengers.

Therefore, in order to help reduce crowding, we set out a £2 billion programme to put cycling and walking at the heart of transport, with £250 million emergency spending already underway.

Over the past week, we have followed this up by publishing 3 pieces of detailed guidance.

First, for local authorities in England, explaining how they should prepare for significantly-increased numbers of cyclists and pedestrians.

Next, for the transport sector, to ensure they provide safer services for those travelling, and safer workplaces for their staff.

And third, and most importantly, for passengers.

We’re asking the public to help ensure that the transport system does not become significantly overwhelmed by returning commuters.

The guidance makes clear, that if you can’t walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it, rather than travelling by bus, train or tram…..

Especially where that public transport is liable to be overcrowded.

And, for those people who absolutely need to use public transport…

It also explains how you can best protect yourself and those around you.

Transport upgrades during lockdown

In the coming weeks, as we carefully and cautiously restart sectors of our economy, and people begin to travel once again…

They should notice that, whilst the country has been in down-time…

…with the roads and railways quiet…

We’ve been busy…

Getting on with essential work….

Fixing the nation’s infrastructure…

So we can recover faster when the time comes.

This upgrade programme…

…the kind of work that – at any other time –  would cause inevitable disruption and service delays, whilst costing the taxpayer more…

…has instead been carried out in previously unimaginable circumstances of a largely unused transport network.

For example, we completed 419 separate Network Rail projects over Easter, with a further 1,000 upgrades being carried out throughout the May bank holidays.

Meanwhile, Highways England has been busy accelerating maintenance projects on the nation’s roads.

Last week, for example, we opened the vital A14 upgrade 7 months ahead of schedule.

This is a route normally used by 85,000 drivers daily, which will dramatically improve access to the UK’s largest container port at Felixstowe and permanently boost the distribution of goods around the UK.

As Northern Powerhouse minister – I can report that – in the North, we’ve delivered £96 million of rail infrastructure improvements during April.

And throughout the country, we’ve accelerated maintenance projects on road and rail…

Whilst always sticking to PHE safety guidelines…..

So that altogether, Highways England has delivered over £200 million of upgrades, and Network Rail £550 million worth, during April alone.

I’d like to thank the army of transport and construction workers who have been grafting very hard throughout the lockdown.

Building future infrastructure

But to make sure that Britain is ready to bounce-back from coronavirus…

Today I can announce nearly £2 billion to upgrade our roads and railways, to put our transport infrastructure in the best possible shape and to get our economy growing once again.

This package includes £1.7 billion for local roads – making journeys smoother and safer for drivers, hauliers, cyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians and others…

By filling millions of dangerous potholes, we will make our roads safer – and encourage more people to cycle, or even take part in the upcoming e-scooter trials…

Helping more people play a part in relieving pressure on public transport.

This investment will also help fix damage caused by winter flooding, repair roads and bridges, and fund numerous road improvement schemes.

As more people become mobile again, we’ll be building a network of rapid charging stations for electric cars…

Including a big expansion of rapid-charging facilities at motorway service stations…

Helping the country to lock-in the dramatic air-quality improvements we’ve experienced during the coronavirus lockdown.

A better future

Amid all the sad news and tragedy of loved ones we’ve lost, we’ve somehow managed to do things in weeks that would normally take years…

Building new hospitals…

Moving public services online…

Making instant reforms and fast-tracking new laws…

Extraordinary changes in the way that employers and employees work…

Effectively taking large swathes of the economy online almost overnight…

Now we want to keep this momentum going.

If building a new hospital takes 2 weeks, why should building a new road still take as long as 20 years?

If GP surgeries can quickly move online, why are most rail passengers still travelling on cardboard tickets?

We must exploit our newfound capacity to respond at pace and apply it to rapidly improving our infrastructure.

And we must examine why it is that bureaucratic bindweed makes British infrastructure some of the costliest and slowest in Europe to build.

Because whilst many will continue to work from home even after this immediate crisis…

…both the long-term transport trend and the pressing need to level-up communities across the country, dictate that infrastructure will be even more important in stimulating our recovery and supporting new jobs.

So by combining fast home-internet access, with vastly upgraded transport connections, we can help revive many of our small and medium-sized towns which over decades have been left behind.

Closing remarks

This has been a devastating start to the year, not just for Britain, but for the world.

And we are only at Phase 1 of the recovery plan.

But we all know that it is our reaction to adversity that will ultimately define how we recover.

We must harness our approach to tackling the pandemic….

And apply it to rebuilding our own infrastructure.

With the same swift action, innovation, and collective determination that has characterised the past few months…..

And in doing so, we can emerge stronger.","Department for Transport and The Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP",2020-05-14,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/transport-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-14-may-2020"

Coronavirus press conference 22 April 2020.

Welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference.

I’m pleased to be joined by Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and also our Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Nicholas Carter.

Before CDS talks through the fantastic work that our brilliant armed forces have been doing during this crisis, let me give you an update you on the latest data from the COBR coronavirus data file.

I can report that through the Government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:

559,935 people have now been tested for the virus.

133,495 have tested positive.

Of those who have contracted the virus, 18,100 have very sadly died.

We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of these victims and my heart goes out to every single one of those who have lost a loved one throughout this crisis.

As a Government, we continue to take the steps necessary to slow the spread of this virus.

The social distancing measures that people have overwhelmingly adhered to have meant that fewer people have needed hospital treatment.

That has protected our NHS capacity as we continue through the peak of this virus and it has undoubtedly helped to save lives.

At every point in this crisis, we have considered the scientific and the medical evidence that we have received very carefully.

And we have been  deliberate in our actions so that we take the right steps at the right time.

Now I know it has been tough going for businesses, for families and for vulnerable members of our communities up and down the country.

It’s been a physical strain as we adapt to living and working at home while not seeing our family and our friends in the usual way we’d like to.

It’s been an economic strain as businesses have had to furlough staff which is why the Chancellor launched the various business support measures to help see businesses and workers through these difficult times.

But it has also been an immense mental strain on everyone: people stuck at home, families worried about their finances and the elderly more isolated than we’d ever want them to be.

We’re making progress through the peak of this virus, but we’re not out of the woods yet as SAGE advised last week.

That’s why the measures we introduced must remain in place for the time being.

The greatest risk for us now, if we eased up on our social distancing rules too soon, is that we would risk a second spike in the virus with all the threats to life that would bring, and then the risk of a second lockdown which would prolong the economic pain that we’re going through.

That was a point that Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, also made earlier on today.

So with that in mind, last Thursday, I set out the five principles that will guide our approach going forward to the next phase, and which must be satisfied before we are willing and in a position to make any changes, which will of course be based on the advice that we receive form SAGE.

That way we will ensure that our path out of this crisis is sure-footed, protecting both the public’s health but also our economy.

If we stick to our plan, if take the right steps at the right time, we can get through this crisis, and I know we will.

There’s no hiding the scale of this tragedy.

But even in our darkest moments, the crisis has also shone a light on the best amongst us.

The nation has come together to applaud our heroic NHS staff, our carers every week, and we pay tribute to their dedication and their professionalism and care with which they look after those who have fallen sick.

With General Carter here, today, I think it is only fitting to pay tribute to the amazing work of our fantastic armed forces and the whole MoD led by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace.

They have been there every step of the way, helping us to build the new NHS Nightingale hospitals to reinforce our critical care capacity. Supporting our Local Resilience Forums in delivering Personal Protective Equipment where it’s needed most.

And helping also deliver the mobile labs which are critical to ramping up of testing capacity right across the country.

As a result of those efforts and that team work, hospitals have been able to treat more patients, as result they save more lives and we have ensured that the peak of this virus has not overwhelmed the NHS.

And, today, our armed forces are again part of that team as we announce two new deployments to the NHS Nightingale facilities in Harrogate and Bristol.

Across the UK, this extra hospital capacity which itself comes on top of the 33,000 additional beds we’ve managed to free up across the NHS.

That is the equivalent of building an extra 50 district general hospitals. And as I said, that has safeguarded the capacity in our hospitals to care both for coronavirus patients but also make sure other people get the urgent care or the emergency treatment they need.

People used to joke in this country that you could never build a hospital that quickly.

Well, we didn’t just build one, we built seven and we thank our armed forces for helping to make that happen.

And, you know, for many countries around the world, including modern democracies, the sight of their military on the streets in a national emergency could be a cause for concern or even trepidation.

But for the British people, the sight of our armed forces working side by side with our brilliant NHS staff offers a calm reassurance that the task is at hand, that we will come through this crisis.

Now I make no bones about it.

There have been challenges, there still are challenges.

We’re not there yet.
We continue to ramp up the testing capacity, which will play a really important role in the next phase of the crisis.

Amidst a global shortage in Personal Protective Equipment, we’ve distributed over a billion items to the front line, where its needed most.

We’ve just brought in Lord Deighton who helped organise the London Olympics to boost our domestic supply even further.

And I am on the phone every day pursuing the next batch of deliveries from abroad with the support of our tireless diplomatic service. The first of several new deliveries landed from Turkey in the early hours of this morning.

We will only come through this global pandemic, if we come together as a nation, and if we bring other countries around the world together so that we can rise to this international challenge.

As we work with our partners abroad to get the PPE we need, to get the ventilators we need to pursue a vaccine for this terrible virus, we’re also working night and day to return stranded British nationals from all four corners of the world.

We’ve kept airports open and airlines running to bring over a million Brits home on commercial flights. A massive endeavour.

On top of that, at the FCO, we set up a £75 million special charter arrangement with the airlines and that’s already brought home over thirteen thousand people back on 63 flights from more than a dozen countries.

And, we’re organising more charter flights in the days ahead from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

So at home and abroad, we’re meeting the whole range of challenges that coronavirus presents.

And if we stick together, and if we stay the course, we will defeat this virus for good.

"70","Speech","Speech to NHS Clinical Commissioners conference","The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock spoke about how we can use the lessons learnt during the pandemic to build a better health service for everyone.","A wise man once said that “the NHS is the best gift a nation ever gave itself”. And throughout this incredibly tough year, at this national time of need, the NHS has been there – as it always is – standing tall to protect us.

But, we all know that this battle against coronavirus is not over yet. And you know better than anybody that the number of hospitalisations are on the rise and we must get this virus under control. And we have seen the very real risk of the NHS being overwhelmed, and so we have acted quickly to make sure that we put in place our new national measures. Because we cannot do this without you, without the NHS. People understand, people feel very deeply, the need to do what they must do to make sure the NHS can be there for us all.

And while we are rightly focused at this moment on the demands of the pandemic and we have thrown everything we have got at making sure that the NHS has what it needs this winter:

with the extra funding and the Nightingale hospital standing ready once again if needed
  with the increase in the number of doctors and nurses and other staff
  the returners which come back to our wards
  and the upgrades to almost every emergency department in the country
We all know what a huge task is going on right now. But I also today want to cast our eyes forward, to look ahead beyond this critical day-to-day work that we are doing in response to coronavirus and ahead of this winter. I want to ask some crucial questions about the long term, about how we can use the lessons that we have learnt during this crisis to build a better health service for us all.

I have seen so many examples this year of systems working together for the benefit of patients, because that is what system working is all about. I have seen it where hospitals are under pressure with numbers of coronavirus patients. And making sure that the whole NHS comes together to ensure care can be provided.

I have seen healthcare teams working side by side with charities and community groups to offer clinics for hard-to-reach patients. I have seen the phenomenal effort to look after rough sleepers – working together across the system, with local authorities and the NHS side by side. From housing to the NHS, to public health. All to protect the most vulnerable.

I think, in fact I know, that the system works best when it is empowered to work together, when the relationships are strong. And crucially when we remove barriers to our cooperation wherever we find them. To support a better, less fragmented set of decision-making. And to allow the well-rounded care which is vital in a world of complex interrelated conditions.

So, while we work on the day-to-day, so we must learn from how the day-to-day works well and drive this agenda forward, building on the NHS Long Term Plan and working towards a system as the default approach by next year. A systems approach can best serve the interests both of patients and of course of those who are giving the care within the NHS. Because it can give leaders the backing they need to empower them to solve problems in their area. So, whether it is, for instance, breaking down the barriers between community and hospital care, whether it is the joining up health and social care, making sure that prevention and public health agenda are tied together with treatment.

Integration of course is not a ‘silver bullet’ for all problems in healthcare, not by any means. But if we bring to bear the whole wealth and diversity of experience that exists in a local community and learn from where things go well, then we will have a much better chance of helping people live healthier and happier lives for longer. That, after all, is what it is all about.

But building a better NHS is not just about the structures and the systems. I know from talking to so many of you that it is about the culture too. Now of course the culture is underpinned by the legislation in which we operate and by the financial structures that are put in place. But there is an unspoken ethos that drives any organisation. And we must ensure that the culture of how we work together embraces innovation and new ideas and embraces collaboration rather than a silo approach.

During the demands of the pandemic, we have seen how people do their best work because they were trusted to do their job. And here too I want to take forward the lessons that together we have learnt by:

shedding unnecessary bureaucracy that gets in the way of doing your job
  intensifying our use of the most transformative technologies so that people and clinicians can do their best work and spend more time with patients
  and making it easier to bring the right qualified people to the front line, like of course those returnees
  and like the way we are allowing more people with more clinical qualifications to be trained in order to participate in the vaccination programme
So this is what is behind our People Plan. For the first time ever we have a Chief People Officer in the NHS and Prerana Issar is absolutely brilliant. She has put together a People Plan which is not a single document, it is a whole series of interventions all about showing how we will improve the support we offer to colleagues across the NHS. From practical support like better rest facilities which are so important to people, to the emotional support that is so vital. Every single person working in the NHS has contributed to the unprecedented national effort to beat back this virus and save lives.

And I will do my utmost to protect and support you through this pandemic and beyond. And through our People Plan we will constantly strive to make the NHS a brilliant place to work, that is central to delivering on the promise that the NHS holds out for the people of this country and the patients who we look after and the citizens who we serve.

Now of course coronavirus has also shone a light on some of the inequalities of our health system and the disparities you can find in your health and healthcare depending on your background, where you live, what job you do. We all need to keep working to level up health and care provision. In the same way that as a government we want to level up in education, and housing and so many other areas of our society. And one of the ways that we can do this is by strengthening our public health systems. Not just the standing capacity to respond to future threats to public health through the new National Institute for Health Protection. But also the vital health improvement work. Improving people’s health, which of course improves quality of life and making sure that we support people to get the very best that they can out of life, by making sure we support people to improve their own health.

Now central to this is tackling obesity. And in fact, the coronavirus epidemic and the link from obesity to morbidity has shown yet again how important this agenda is. Our new obesity strategy, which builds upon work of the past, is full of measures to help people make healthier choices.

But there is so much more to do across the whole spectrum of health improvement. We want to embed health improvement more deeply all across the board. And I see this as a critical moment to ensure that we don’t parcel out health improvement and see it as something separate. But see how health improvement is and must be embedded in the work of the NHS, local authorities and so many government departments.

We know that we can help more people to stay out of hospital in the first place. Just as we know that they will get the very best possible medical care when they do come into the NHS. And we all have to lean into the health improvement agenda, especially in primary care. When done right, health improvement has always been at the core of its responsibilities.

Now I know that this has not been an easy year for the NHS. But I also know that when people look back on this tough time in our history, they will be awed by the outstanding contribution that has been made by so many people. And so many people that are taking part in this conference today. You have been there for us, just as you always are. So, I would like to thank you once more, for your incredible efforts and for the efforts that are still to come. You show the country at its best and all of us are in your debt. Thank you.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-11-12,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-to-nhs-clinical-commissioners-conference"
"71","Speech","Universities Minister calls for true social mobility","Speaking to the NEON summit on widening access and mobility, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan, outlines a new approach to social mobility.","Thank you, Graeme, and good morning everyone. I am so pleased to be able to join you today for this virtual event and to see so many of you attending.

So we all know the current situation presents new challenges for us all, including prospective students.

This is particularly true for those in disadvantaged groups who may not be able to rely on their schools, colleges or teachers for information, advice and guidance that is so crucial in this time of their lives.

And providers have new challenges to be able to reach and connect with young people – such as the challenge of how to make a university tour engaging and meaningful when it is online.

I’ve been impressed by the innovation some providers have shown and it is now more important than ever to share ideas and good practice.

Initiatives such as UpReach show what can be done.

They’ve recently launched a new range of Assessed Virtual Internships that have delivered opportunities for over 1000 disadvantaged students. They provide training in areas from communication skills to coding, with top performers recommended for graduate positions at leading firms such as Deloitte and McKinsey.

It shows what really can be done with technology.

We always need to remember why we are doing this – we are doing this to level the playing field by creating opportunities for those who for too long haven’t had those chances.

I do believe it is down to all of us to open up opportunities so that every person can rise to the position that their talents and hard work allows.

But today I want to send a strong message – that social mobility isn’t about getting more people into university.

For decades we have been recruiting too many young people on to courses that do nothing to improve their life chances or help with their career goals.

True social mobility is about getting people to choose the path that will lead to their desired destination and enabling them to complete that path.

True social mobility is when we put students and their needs and career ambitions first, be that in HE, FE or apprenticeships.

Whatever path taken, I want it to lead to skilled, meaningful jobs, that fulfil their ambitions and improve their life earnings, whether that’s as a teacher, an electrician, a lawyer, a plumber, a nurse or in business.

But don’t get me wrong - higher education should be open to all, all those who are qualified by ability and attainment.

And universities do need to do much, much more to ensure that all students - and particularly those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds - are recruited on to courses that will deliver good outcomes and that they have the confidence to apply and the information they need to make informed choices.

That’s why, I really welcome the launch of UCAS’ Clearing+ this year, so that those applicants in clearing will be sent a personalised set of options and courses they could take with the grades they have achieved.

This is especially needed given the pandemic has led to less face time with teachers and advisors and will particularly benefit those from disadvantaged backgrounds or those who, like me, are the first in their family to go to university.

It will make it easier for every applicant with the right grades to obtain the right place for them so that every young person can truly achieve their potential.

In order to tackle the gaps in achievement and higher education progression between groups of learners, and ensure they don’t widen because of the impact of COVID-19, new, innovative forms of collaboration at the national level will be essential.

Uni4me, led by NEON, is a prime example of this kind of collaboration.

Uni4me is a new, online hub bringing together over 50 HE providers and uni-connect consortia to offer support including virtual online and blended learning courses, online tuition and support in core GCSE and A Level subjects and plus Live events involving leading academics, students and specialist HE advisors.

So I am delighted that today I have been asked to officially ‘launch’ uni4me which goes live today. I am sure that it will make a significant contribution.

Now, turning back, to the wider point of social mobility and higher education in general – I do believe that we need to think again.

The 2004 access regime has let down too many young people. Since 2004, there has been too much focus on getting students through the door, and not enough focus on how many drop out, or how many go on to graduate jobs.

Too many have been misled by the expansion of popular sounding courses with no real demand from the labour market.

Quite frankly, our young people have been taken advantage of – particularly those without a family history of going to university. Instead some have been left with the debt of an investment that didn’t pay off in any sense.

And too many universities have felt pressured to dumb down – either when admitting students, or in the standards of their courses. We have seen this with grade inflation and it has to stop.

We need to end the system of arbitrary targets that are not focused on the individual student’s needs and goals.
And let’s be clear – we help disadvantaged students by driving up standards, not by levelling down.

In the school system we’re fortunate enough to have visionary leaders such as Rachel de Souza, and they reject low expectations. What they and their schools have achieved for some of the most disadvantaged children in the UK is outstanding, delivering phenomenal results and getting them into some of the best universities in the country, into courses that are right for them.

They are uncompromising on standards and expect the best from every child.

But the onus must also be on universities to go further too, not just admitting disadvantaged students with good grades, but focusing even more on helping them to achieve and complete courses. And going the extra mile to raise standards and aspirations in schools.

One of the most successful initiatives in this area has been specialist maths schools – which are sponsored by and attached to universities. They provide high quality, inspirational teaching, and help ease the transition between A level and university maths.

In fact, in 2019 King’s Maths School was top in the country for A Level attainment, and that includes independent schools. 100% of students achieved an A or A* in A Level Maths and our commitment is to have a 16-19 maths school in every single region. And so I am delighted that so many universities are already on board with this programme.

Alongside the maths schools established by King’s College London and the University of Exeter,
Cambridge, Durham,  Lancaster, and Surrey universities all have schools in development, and the University of Liverpool Maths School will open this September. There is much to learn from the high quality and long-term involvement that universities have had with these maths schools, and of course, it’s not just maths.

Whether its science, languages, engineering or the humanities, universities should be doing all they can to raise attainment for the less fortunate and work with schools.

That can be sponsoring schools, supporting a robust curriculum or running summer camps, universities have the potential here to make a tremendous difference in opening up opportunities.

So, I want your access budgets not to be spent on marketing but on raising standards, providing the role models, the information, encouraging aspiration and highlighting the high quality opportunities available.

To conclude this Government was elected on a mandate to level up Britain, to deliver greater opportunities to every person and every community in the UK.

Universities must play a vital role in helping to achieve this mission and helping to achieve the transformation of lives.

So, today I’m calling for change, to start a new era on access and participation. One that’s based on raising standards, not on dumbing down; on putting prospective students and their ambitions and their needs first; on results and impact, not on box ticking and marketing; and on delivering graduates into jobs that really will transform their lives.","Department for Education and Michelle Donelan MP",2020-07-01,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/universities-minister-calls-for-true-social-mobility"
"72","Speech","Universities Minister announces mental health support for students","Universities Minister, Michelle Donelan, talks to HEPI about the impact of Covid-19 on the sector and mental health support for students during this time.","Good morning everyone.
I am so pleased to be able to join you today and I’d like to thank HEPI for going ahead with this conference, in spite of Covid’s many challenges. 
If the pandemic has shown us anything it is that it is so important to keep our communications going, and to keep talking to one another because the world hasn’t suddenly ground to a halt and young people’s hopes and aspirations haven’t stopped. 
The same dreams are still being dreamt and their plans are still being made.
I’d like to say at this point that I am so proud and grateful for the leadership our higher education providers have shown throughout the crisis, which has meant that students plans haven’t had to be put on hold.

Universities didn’t close and students will graduate as planned and new students will start university this year.

However, it is really important to note that this is also massively down to the resilience and resourcefulness of our students.

This is a really unsettling time for students, and we are working very hard with the sector to support them as we all try to adjust to this new way of living.

But I want to take this opportunity to basically say – hats off to our students - university is challenging enough time as it is – but this cohort have also faced an entire new set of challenges.

And in years to come I genuinely believe employers will seek out the students of today who will be synonymous with resilience, flexibility and determination.

So, as you know, last month my Department announced a package of measures to stabilise university admissions, relieve cash flow pressures on the sector and generally enhance the information available to students as well as support mechanisms.

Let me be clear, we want every student who wishes to go to university and who meets the entry requirements to do so, coronavirus or no coronavirus, but we had been seeing activities that were putting students under undue pressure like the 30,000 unconditional offers made in one week alone.

The controls we have asked for will help reduce pressure on students by allowing them the flexibility to work out what is right for them and what is in their interest.

Our package makes provision for higher education providers to recruit students up to a temporary set level. This has been based on forecasts from the sector themselves, which allows additional growth of up to 5% in the next academic year.

The Education Secretary may also allocate an additional 10,000 places on top of this, of which 5,000 will be allocated to students studying nursing or allied health courses.

I began by stressing the importance of talking to one another and we will continue to work closely with the sector in putting the policy into practice.

The impacts of this crisis are stark and they are varied, and I know that unfortunately this means some students will be far worse affected than others. 
I want to reassure you that we are very aware of this and I continue to work with the sector to ensure hardship funding is available. That is why we have worked closely with the OfS to enable universities to draw upon grant funding aimed at access and provision, worth up to £23 million per month from April to July, to use towards those funds.

When lockdown began, as we all know, universities needed to make sure that students would continue to get high quality teaching and assessment.

Provision did move online quickly, and in many cases within just 24 hours. Now we’re in a position where the vast majority of HE providers plan to move to blended or dual provision for the next academic year.

So while courses and timetables are being redesigned to be suitable for these new styles of delivery and the next academic year already looks very different to what students may have expected; the depth and breadth of the curriculum, the quality of the teaching, and the value of the degree achieved, must stay the same.

Covid-19 could be with us for a very long time and as universities prepare for the next academic year, they may well be operating in a very different learning environment. Regardless of this, they must still make sure that all students, no matter what background, can expect to get the same kind of high quality academic experience that they would have done before the pandemic broke out.

The Office for Students, has published information and guidance for providers and The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education has developed a series of guides to secure academic standards and to support student achievement.

I must say I really was pleased to read HEPI’s own survey that many providers have been pretty successful in meeting their students’ academic needs. Students felt that overall, academic experience was better than expected, and that contact hours had actually increased. They were also doing more assignments, getting more feedback and were feeling more supported in their independent study.

This is quite frankly tremendous feedback and was partly achieved by making the most of educational technology. I do think this sets us up well for the future and I would encourage all providers to build on this as they plan ahead over the next few months and after Covid.

However, the HEPI survey also revealed that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the experience of some students, both academically and in terms of their wellbeing, and no one can be surprised by this.

The survey found that students are reporting far lower levels of wellbeing compared with the general population which I find, and I’m sure you will find, deeply concerning.

I know that many universities have already put support services in place and I would like to use this opportunity to thank them for being so quick on the ball in responding to their students’ needs.

When the pandemic struck my first letter to each institution specifically reminded them of their responsibility of care to students and especially in relation to student mental health. I made it clear that I expected support to be transitioned online, prioritised and bolstered where possible.

I know that some universities have for example been offering additional student check-in services, where staff have volunteered to provide direct support services, and others have enhanced their feedback and online wellbeing services.

In addition to this I also welcome providers reaching out directly to vulnerable groups of students, checking they are well and supported during this time.

Please don’t let up on these efforts. Vulnerable students are going to need all the help they can get, especially those who are estranged or who are care leavers.

And to any student who is listening and who may be feeling anxious or need help, I would urge you to get in touch with your university’s student support and welfare teams. They really will be able to offer you valuable help and support.

The Office for Students have published guidance on vulnerable students on a range of topics, to help universities give the best support that they can.

And I can confirm that student premium funding which I referenced before can be used during this time to support student mental health.

In addition to this, the £1m of funding that I announced in March for the OfS Challenge Competition to develop innovative approaches to addressing mental health challenges for at risk groups will also move this agenda forward.

Mental health and the wellbeing of all students, whether they come from here or further afield, must be a top priority and it certainly is one of mine. I don’t want any student to feel that they cannot get help if they need it.

University is hard at the best of times, we all know that, but the challenges and upheaval that young people face can be compounded and create mental health problems. It’s an area I feel we must continue to shine a spotlight on – now more than ever because I can only imagine the turmoil that adding Covid-19 into the mix must produce.

So that’s why I have worked with the OFS and today I am delighted to announce Student Space, a new online resource that will be funded up to £3 million by the Office for Students, and led by student minds.

It will really enable all students at English and Welsh universities to have access to a variety of mental health and welfare support services.

They’ll be able to draw on this whatever course they’re doing or whatever university they’re studying at and it will operate daily for a period of six months.

Student Space has been developed to close those gaps in student support services which have become apparent during the pandemic and is designed to work alongside the existing services.

It will offer a whole range of help including preventative support and immediate interventions for those in distress, from therapeutic interventions, to stress relievers, suggestions for strengthening mental health, and quality-assured online resources such as peer support platforms and volunteering opportunities.

I do believe that Student Space will make a true difference to so many students across England and wales.

To conclude I want to reiterate my thanks to both staff and students, but let’s be under no illusion - there is still significant work and challenges to face ahead as we ease out of lock down.

However, by working together we can continue to deliver for students and with the best Higher education offer in the world. And at the heart of this process we must keep the welfare and health of our students – who, after all, are actually the heart of all our Universities.","Department for Education and Michelle Donelan MP",2020-06-17,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/universities-minister-announces-mental-health-support-for-students"
"73","Speech","Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 18 June 2020","Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock gave the 18 June 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.","Good afternoon, and welcome to the Downing Street daily coronavirus briefing.

I’m joined today by Baroness Dido Harding, the Executive Chair of NHS Test and Trace.

Before we start, I want to recognise the sad loss of Dame Vera Lynn. She united us in the worst crisis that this country faced. Ever since, she’s inspired us all with the words she will always be associated with: ‘we will meet again’.

We send our condolences to her family and we will all remember her warmly.

First things first, I’d like to take you through the latest data, then talk about NHS Test and Trace and vaccines.

First slide please.

The first slide shows that yesterday there were 136,516 tests, taking the total to 7-and-a-quarter million tests in total. There were 1,218 positive test results.

If we go to the next slide, this slide shows the estimated number of people who had COVID-19 in England according to ONS’s (Office for National Statistics) survey. As you can see, the number has been coming down over time. And this same survey implies around 4.5 thousand new cases per day.

Data from hospitals also shows that broad downward direction. There 490 admissions with COVID-19 on 15 June and, as we can see, the number of people on mechanical ventilator beds is 360.

The number of people in hospital continues to come down in almost every region. You can see a very small up-tick in the east of England. But, as you can see from the charts, there is some movement in the variation in each of the lines.

Overall movement continues to be down. Overall, 5,193 down from 5,863 this time last week.

Final slide of this group. When it comes to the number of people who have sadly died from coronavirus, yesterday the number of deaths reported was 135, bringing the total to 42,288. Again, we can see the downward trajectory, thankfully, of that number.

The number of 135 is lower than this time last week, but there’s still some way to go.

There’s one additional report that’s worth looking at.

Today’s weekly surveillance report from Public Health England shows that last week, for the first week since mid-March, the number of people who died in this country, in total, from coronavirus or anything else, was no higher than is normal at this time of year. So that demonstrates that the number of deaths is coming right down

But the battle against this virus is not over.

And it’s a battle with many fronts. And there are 2 areas that I want to update you about today.

Vaccines

The first is vaccines.

Before I talk about coronavirus vaccines, I just want to mention a very important reminder about other routine vaccines that are there to protect you.

Throughout the crisis we’ve tried to keep the vaccination programme for children going. That has been largely successful.

But if you, or your child, is invited for a vaccination, like MMR, please make sure you attend. It’s very important we don’t fall behind on vaccinations for other diseases because of this crisis.

During this pandemic, we have put stringent measures in place to protect people who are getting vaccinations.

And, in the long run, the best way to defeat this virus is, of course, the discovery of a vaccine. And, since the start, we have been supporting the most promising projects.

As of this week, the Imperial vaccine is now in the first phase of human clinical trials and AstraZeneca has struck a deal for the manufacture of the Oxford vaccine.

They’re starting manufacturing now, even ahead of approval, so we can build up a stockpile and be ready, should it be clinically approved. Just like with dexamethasone, the treatment which we stockpiled before we had the proof it was clinically effective. So we are starting the manufacture of the Oxford vaccine now so that it will be ready should the science come off.

Today, we have published the way in which we propose to prioritise people for access to a vaccine, as soon as one comes available.

Just as we did for testing, we will be guided by the clinical science, prioritising those in most need.

I am very grateful to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which has published its interim advice today.

They recommend priority vaccination for 2 groups: frontline health and social care workers, and those at increased risk of serious disease and death from coronavirus, including, for example, adults over the age of 50 and those with heart and kidney disease.

As we learn more about the virus, we will continue to take into account which groups may be particularly vulnerable, including for example those from ethnic minority backgrounds.

So we can protect the most at risk first should a vaccine become available and get this country back on her feet as soon as we possibly can.

Test and Trace

Our approach on vaccines is to throw everything at it, as fast as we can, and rigorously to test and make sure they are safe before deployment.

This is our approach across the board, including for Test and Trace too. That’s the second area I want to focus on today.

Baroness Harding will talk through the latest figures from our NHS Test and Trace programme shortly.

Today’s data shows a system that is working well and constantly improving. And, remember, each one of the thousands of people who are now isolating because of the NHS Test and Trace programme and all the work of those involved is someone who would have been innocently going about their daily lives not knowing that they were a risk to their community.

And, as you may remember, our plan is to complement this human contact tracing with a contact tracing app. Like other governments around the world, we have been working hard on this, and I want to be up-front and open about the challenges that we, and other countries, are facing.

Over the past few weeks, we have rigorously tested our prototype app in the Isle of Wight, and in field trials ‒ and I want to thank everyone who has been involved and all the islanders of the Isle of Wight: the council, who have been brilliant, the local NHS, and Bob Seely, the local MP, who has played a real leadership role.

Because of this testing, we discovered a technical barrier, that every other country building their own app is also now hitting. We have found that our app works well on Android devices, but Apple’s software prevents iPhones being used effectively for contact tracing, unless you use Apple’s own technology.

After we started work on our app, Google and Apple then started work on their own product, and as soon as they did this, we began working on both. We kept our options open, in the same way as we do with other areas

And I feel, personally, in this fight, more than any other, we must leave no stone unturned. So I asked Dido and the NHS expert Test and Trace team to make sure they worked on both products.

Oof course, we have been testing Google and Apple’s product too. And as we did this, we have found that it does not estimate distance well enough. Measuring distance is mission critical to any contact tracing app.

So, as it stands, our app won’t work, because Apple won’t change their system. But it can measure distance.

And their app can’t measure distance well enough to a standard we are satisfied with. Throughout this, for me, what matters is what works. Because what works will save lives.

And I will work with anyone, public or private sector, here or overseas, to gain any inch of ground against this disease. So we have agreed to join forces with Google and Apple, to bring the best bits of both systems together.

We will share our algorithm and the work we have done on distance calculation and combine that with their work, to deliver a new solution.

I have always been optimistic about the contribution technology can make in this battle against coronavirus. Coming together in this way will bring together some of the best minds to find a solution to this global challenge and help to save lives.

In the meantime, the NHS Test and Trace system, based on good, old fashioned human contact tracing, is working well identifying local outbreaks and helping us to control this virus.

And so I want to ask you all once more: if you get a call or message from NHS Test and Trace, the most important thing is please do your bit to protect your community, to protect your loved ones and to protect the NHS by following their instructions.

Now I’d like to hand over to Baroness Harding, to take you through the Test and Trace statistics.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-06-18,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-18-june-2020"
"74","Speech","Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 11 June 2020","Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock gave the 11 June 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.","Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.

I am delighted to be joined by the Baroness Dido Harding, the executive chair of NHS test and trace. Before we turn to test and trace let’s go through the daily slides. If we have the first slide, please.

This slide shows testing and the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus.

And the figures show that as of yesterday there were 197,007 tests, bringing the total number of tests that have been done in this country to more than 6,240,801.

And the number of confirmed cases as of yesterday was 1,266, bringing the total number of confirmed positive test results to 291,409.

And you can see that despite the vast increase in the number of tests that have been carried out, the number of positive cases continues to fall, and has been falling on that 7-day rolling average, a little bit up from the very low figure yesterday of 1,003, but nevertheless continuing overall to fall.

Next slide, please. This matches the data from hospitals, which shows that the number of new admissions with COVID-19, excluding Scotland, was 462 on the 8 June and this is down from 658 a week earlier on the first of June and down from a peak of over 3,000 in late March.

Likewise, the number of those people on ventilator beds, mechanical ventilators, is down to 440. Down from 604 a week ago, and again, that was over 3,000 at the peak so it’s very good progress to see both of those numbers continuing to fall over recent days.

If we turn now to the next slide, which shows the regional breakdown. Again, as it has throughout this crisis, this shows that the shape is broadly the same in most regions of the country and the downward trend persists everywhere, which is obviously very good news.

If we turn now to the number of deaths, the final slide. The latest figures show that yesterday 151 people died with coronavirus, that’s the reported number, bringing the total to 41,279.

Again, we can see this downward trend continues to come down and in fact the number of deaths over the past week is the lowest since the week ending on the 28 of March and this is good progress but clearly, clearly there is more to do.

And these data show that this virus is in retreat.

In summary, we’re working through our plan and the plan is working and that means we’re able to restore some of the freedoms that people hold so dear.

And from the beginning of lockdown the challenge has been not just how to get the virus under control but how then to be able to ease the lockdown measures.

I was really delighted by the announcement that the Prime Minister was able to make yesterday, allowing these bubbles so that single parents or those who live alone will be able to form a support bubble with one other household.

I think this is a big step forward. It’s very difficult to imagine the impact if you haven’t lived on your own for 12 weeks and so I’m really pleased that we’ve been able to restore that human contact and the support that so many have been missing.

And I know the Prime Minister’s announcement has given such hope and comfort to so many and I’m really pleased at the very positive reception that it’s got.

To help us take more measures to come out of lockdown of course, the Prime Minister tasked Dido and I with delivering a test and trace system.

Testing for the virus and tracing how it’s spread is critical to containing it locally so that we can ease the national lockdown.

And it’s by isolating the virus that we can control it and we can stop it spreading through our communities.

In this plan to lift lockdown test and trace is our radar if you like: it helps us identify where the virus is and trace how it’s spreading through the community.

And you have your part to play.

If you have symptoms, you must immediately self-isolate and get a test. It’s easy to get a test on NHS.UK or by dialling 119.

If you test positive you must work with NHS test and trace to identify who you’ve been in close contact with and if you are asked by NHS test and trace to isolate, you must do so to break the chain of transmission and to stop the spread of the virus.

I would even go so far as to say that participation with NHS test and trace is your civic duty.

Please, do it to protect your loved ones, do it to protect your community, do it to protect the nation, and do it to protect the NHS.

Today we’re able to publish some of the initial statistics about the first week of operation of NHS test and trace.

Baroness Harding will take as through these figures in a moment, but I just wanted to put them in a bit of context. They paint a positive picture as we will see when we go through the figures.

Firstly, remember that they represent just the first 7 days of this service and yet it’s already had a huge impact. The system is working well and as we both said at the start, we will keep improving it.

It will keep getting better and I think you’ll see from these figures why we are confident that it will be world class.

And I’m also delighted to say we still have spare capacity, and long may it remain so. This is a good thing. It’s a sign of the team’s success.

And I just want to take this moment before I hand over, on behalf of us all, to thank Dido and her team, to thank the army of contact tracers, thank you, to thank the NHS and Public Health England who are playing such an important role, to thank the private companies without whom this would be impossible, including Boots and Amazon and Serco and Sitel.

And finally, I want to thank you for your participation. It is brilliant that the vast majority of people have done their civic duty.

And as we work through our plan and as we keep driving this virus down let us maintain that spirit and fortitude that has helped us throughout this pandemic.

And that of course includes not attending large gatherings, including demonstrations, of more than 6 people.

Now, I understand that people want to show their passion for a cause they care deeply about but this is a virus that thrives on social contact, regardless of what your cause may be.

So please, for the safety of your loved ones, stay alert, control the virus and save lives. I am now going to hand over to Baroness Harding to take us all through the test and trace statistics.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-06-17,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-11-june-2020"

Good afternoon.

I want to begin by answering the big question that people have been asking in the last 48 hours. And that is – is this Government asking you - the people, the public, to do one thing while senior people here in government do something else?

Have we been asking you to make sacrifices, to obey social distancing, to stay at home while some people have been basically flouting those rules and endangering lives?

And it is because I take this matter so seriously and frankly it is so serious that I can tell you today I have had extensive face to face conversations with Dominic Cummings and I have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus. And when he had no alternative, I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent. And I do not mark him down for that. And though there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably false.

I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly, and legally, and with integrity, and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.

And I stress this fundamental aim, because it is thanks to this country’s collective resolve in achieving that aim that we continue to make progress.

So let me give you today’s figures:

3,458,905 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 110,401 tests carried out yesterday
  259,559 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,409 cases since yesterday – a smaller increase than we were seeing over the last few weeks
  8,951 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down 11% from 10,085 this time last week
And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,793 have now died. That’s an increase of 118 fatalities since yesterday.

And each of those fatalities represents a family in mourning, the grief of friends and relatives. And as we mourn them we resolve again to beat this virus and get our country back on its feet. We can and we will.

Two weeks ago I set out the Government’s roadmap to begin easing the measures we put in place to control the spread of coronavirus.

I said that we would do so in a safe and controlled way, based on our assessment of progress against the five tests we set for adjusting the lockdown.

We’re going to set out that assessment in detail in the coming days, but today I can confirm that I do believe we will be in a position to move to step 2 of our plan.

As part of Step 2, we set out plans for a phased reopening of schools.

Because the education of our children is crucial for their welfare, their health, for their long term future and for social justice

And so in line with the approach being taken by other countries, we want to start getting our children back in the classroom in a way that is manageable and as safe as possible.

So we said this would begin with early years settings and reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in primary schools.

Today I can announce that it is our intention to go ahead with that as planned on June 1st, a week on Monday.

We then intend, from June 15th, for secondary schools to provide some contact for Year 10 and Year 12 students to help them prepare for exams next year, with up to a quarter of these students in at any point.

By opening schools to more pupils in this limited way, we are taking a deliberately cautious approach.

And this comes after a constructive period of consultation with schools, teachers and unions, led by the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.

I want to thank all the Education and childcare staff who have stepped up to the challenge and kept schools open throughout this crisis.

The Department for Education will engage with teaching unions, local authorities and school leaders in the coming days, giving them an opportunity to ask questions and probe the evidence behind our plans.

And the final decision will be taken as part of the formal review into lockdown measures which the law requires us to undertake by Thursday. We will of course continue to consider all the evidence (as we said we would do), and will continue to work hard with those bodies over the course of the coming week.

However, I think it is important for us to be clear about the Government’s intentions now, so that teachers and parents can plan in earnest for schools to reopen a week on Monday.

Now I acknowledge that a 1 June opening may not be possible for all schools, but the Government will continue to support and work with the sector to ensure that any schools experiencing difficulties are able to open more widely as soon as possible.

Detailed guidance has been published by the Department for Education on how schools can open in a way which is safe for children, teachers and parents.

While of course we recognise that full social distancing may not be possible, especially when teaching young children, our guidance sets out a range of protective measures to keep children and staff safe. This includes:

reducing the size of classes and keeping children in small groups without mixing with others
  staggered break and lunch times, as well as drop offs and pick ups
  increasing the frequency of cleaning, reducing the used of shared items and utilising outdoor space
All children and staff, and their families, will have access to testing if they display symptoms. This will enable children and staff to get back to school if they test negative, and if they test positive we will take the appropriate reactive measures.

We will continue to work with the sector to support them to prepare for wider opening and ensure all children and young people can continue to receive the best care, education and training possible.

We will set out what moving to step 2 means for other areas, such as non-essential retail and more social contacts, over the course of the next week.

And let me stress once again: we are making good progress.

But that progress is conditional, provisional.

We must keep reducing the incidence of this disease.

We must keep that R down below 1.

And that means we must remember the basics.

Wash our hands, keep social distance, isolate if you have symptoms – and get a test.

We are beating this thing, but we will beat it all the faster if we stay alert, control the virus and save lives.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP",2020-05-24,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-24-may-2020"
"76","Speech","Local Government Association annual conference 2020: Minister for Regional Growth and Local Government's speech","Speech by Simon Clarke MP at the Local Government Association’s annual conference 2020.","Thank you, Izzi, for that warm introduction and to all those of you have joined us virtually this year for an LGA conference like no other.

Thank you for bringing us together under these extraordinary circumstances.

As you know, it’s my first LGA conference as the Minister for Local Government and Regional Growth, having taken office in February.

I am addressing you today humbled by the tireless efforts of every tier of local government in responding to, and tackling, coronavirus…

From parish, town, district, city and county councils…

To local resilience forums, the Metro Mayors and the LGA.

We stand at the beginning of the greatest task of national reconstruction since 1945.

But there are already many achievements for our sector to point to.

Achievements born of crisis…

Conceived at speed…

And delivered in the absence of any precedent, from any time.

You have housed over 15,000 people in desperate need, including rough sleepers.

You have helped over 800,000 businesses to stay afloat through the provision well over £10 billion of Business Grant Funds.

You have helped to deliver countless items of PPE.

And you have helped our high streets and public services to withstand the worst effects of the virus.

When the history of these events is written, you will be able to say: “We did this. We made this possible.”

And I want to take this chance at the outset of my remarks to pay tribute to every frontline worker in local government – the carers, teachers, social workers, emergency planners, refuse collectors and so many others who have worked selflessly and relentlessly during the course of this pandemic.

It’s been a phenomenal effort for which I, and the whole of the government, says a sincere thank you.

I would also like to thank the Economic Recovery Group who have worked closely with me and my Department over the last few weeks.

Your honest and frank assessments of the situation on the ground have been invaluable in developing policy and helping move the country into this new phase focused on recovery.

So where do we go next?

I know this has been one of the most challenging times for local government in living memory.

And you have rightly raised serious concerns about funding for the sector, in the face of shrinking incomes and the costs of this crisis.

The government is listening and we are acting.

During the spring of course, we deployed £3.2 billion in extraordinary grant funding, with a further £600 million for care homes.

And we expect this financial support to now go much further than first envisaged as we bring in separate packages to tackle income pressures.

As the Secretary of State set out yesterday, we are now making £500 million of new funds available to help with immediate constraints while also introducing a new scheme to cover your lost income from sales, fees and charges, including things like car parking fees and leisure service charges.

The package announced yesterday seeks to address some of the severe financial challenges this pandemic has created, while shielding you from the worst losses.

And I say this to every council leader, and every chief executive.

Do not worry in silence.

If the pressures you are facing threaten to become unmanageable, come to my Department and we will discuss constructive next steps.

We want to deliver a wider reset for the sector’s finances, so that we can focus on the task in hand.

Moving from the immediate response to a more forward-looking and robust strategy for enhanced economic growth.

We heard about this from the Prime Minister on Tuesday.

And it is local government that will lead on containing outbreaks and helping communities to stay alert during this time.

The current situation in Leicester demonstrates the need for us to remain vigilant and ensure every area has a united approach that includes LRFs, active policing and clear communication between councils over geographic boundaries.

I’m pleased that upper tier authorities are now able to access postcode-level testing data – I know that more is needed, and we will work tirelessly with you across government to achieve this.

We want to do everything we can to support the upper tier as they put in place robust outbreak control plans…

Plans which allow for the effective monitoring of data with the support of Public Health England and the Joint Biosecurity Centre.

We must be ready and prepared for more outbreaks even though we hope they won’t be on the same size and scale as that seen in Leicester, on most occasions. We have a responsibility to ensure that you, the local tier, have the resources and funding to do this effectively while supporting our economy and society to reopen in a phased and safe manner.

That is our shared challenge ahead – helping communities to stay alert while also ensuring our high streets, our town centres, and our hard-hit businesses can get back on their feet.

Economic recovery

In that regard, I want to place particular focus on our towns and our coastal communities…

Including many places that have felt – with good reason – that they have failed to share the benefits of the growth experienced in other parts of the UK. I come from one of them.

This government has made a solemn pledge to these communities.

And we will not let them down.

They are proud places, steeped in economic and cultural history, that hold the key to a brighter future for us all.

And of course we’ve seen them at the forefront of our national response to coronavirus, showing great adaptability and resilience to keep local economies afloat.

Central government is committed to doing whatever it takes to help these communities to bounce back.

That’s why we introduced the £50 million Reopening High Streets Safely Fund to help councils implement a range of practical safety measures including new signs, street markings, and temporary barriers to help businesses to trade safely.

In addition, we launched the High Street Task Force to provide local places – councils, businesses and community leaders – with the expert advice, training and guidance they need to open their doors once again.

And, with the worst of this pandemic now behind us, we will be able to renew our work on breathing new life into towns and communities through the £3.6 billion Towns Fund.

That means announcing the successful applicants to the Future High Streets Fund in the autumn while also seeing the first tranche of the 100 Town Deals over the line this year.

By the 31st of this month, all Town Investment Plans for the first cohort of communities will have been submitted, and we will be working at speed over the summer to agree Heads of Terms from the end of September.

Once these are in place, towns will have up to 12 months to develop their projects in detail.

I know that a lot of councils will want to move even more quickly than that…

And, in government, we hope to release some of these game-changing investments – up to £25 million in each community – within the year of the Heads of Terms being agreed.

We have also set the deadlines for Cohort 2 towns to submit their TIPs as the 31 October and, for Cohort 3, 31 March next year.

Ensuring that every town has the time it needs to develop in-depth proposals which fully consider the assets and opportunities for each area.

There is no disadvantage to being placed in any of those tiers: the most important thing clearly is that we get the resultant deals right.

I know that for many councils, there isn’t a second to lose in bringing this regenerative investment to the businesses and communities that are waiting for it.

Therefore, we will also allocate £96 million to accelerate investment in towns over the coming months.

This will provide all places selected for town deals with between £500,000 - £1 million to spend on things like improving parks, high streets, and transport.

I do not for one moment underestimate the scale of the investment required to bring the world’s fifth largest economy roaring back into life after months of enforced hibernation.

The £5 billion ‘New Deal’ stimulus package announced this week by the Prime Minister will of course be the lodestar of this national recovery.

And I am looking forward to working with you over the coming weeks to ensure that our communities feel the full benefits from the ‘Getting Building’ fund and the £900 million investment in our infrastructure…

…which will enable exciting projects, ranging from a world leading zero emissions cruise terminal in Southampton, a new Hydro Turbine in Bristol and the regeneration of Elstree Film Studios in Hertfordshire.

ERDF visitor economy funding

It’s also imperative that we drive growth not just in our major cities but also in our coastal and rural communities who have borne the brunt of what I know has been a collapse in tourism.

And to help make that happen, I am today announcing £10 million of additional government investment to boost our visitor economy, drawing down on our remaining allocation from the EU’s Regional Development Fund as we move beyond our exit from the European Union.

This comes in addition to over £50 million already planned, which will support a wide range of shovel ready projects in local communities throughout this summer.

These projects will support job creation through investment in flood defences and transport upgrades, along with grants and advice for small businesses to embrace digital technology and adapt to the new world we live in.

They will build on the success we’ve seen from the government’s £32 million ERDF investments in such tourism-boosting projects across the country….

Projects like the ‘Low Carbon Lake District’ in Cumbria and the creation of a 5km low carbon trail.

And in Cornwall, this government support is improving coastal defences in Long Rock near Penzance, protecting the Great Western rail line and the A30, while strengthening flood defences for over 65 businesses – all important work to protect the area and increase visitor numbers as it becomes safe to visit.

The new funding I am announcing for businesses today will be allocated to Growth Hubs across England, and concentrated in places where the employment share of tourism and hospitality is especially high.

We will begin working with local partners immediately to prioritise this new tranche of critical local growth projects so that they are ready to go live as soon as possible, bringing jobs, investment, and financial support to the communities that need this the most.

Levelling up

Following COVID-19, the need to level up every part of our economy has clearly never been so great.

And to support this effort, it is important that central government ensures you have the tools, resources, and structures to deliver for your communities.

That means funding to help councils transform their digital offer to residents…

Which is why, last month, I announced additional support for these kinds of projects through my Department’s Local Digital Collaboration Unit.

Whilst I am not the most technologically sophisticated individual myself, I am a huge believer in the power of technology to transform the way we deliver these services for the public.

And accordingly, I would love to take this opportunity to encourage as many councils as possible to apply for the Local Digital COVID-19 challenge, and support a wider shift in the way services are designed and delivered.

I hope to say more about this theme for improving digital later in the summer.

We are also pressing ahead with the rapid roll-out of gigabit-capable broadband, while expanding our 5G testbeds so that small businesses and rural communities are no longer held back by patchy coverage and poor download speeds.

The Borderlands Growth Deal voucher scheme in Northumberland and Cumbria is a great example of how we’re partnering with councils to rapidly install gigabit-capable broadband in homes and businesses with internet speeds of less than 30 Mbps.

It’s a model for success which I’d like to see replicated throughout every rural part of the country.

Devolution and local government

Levelling up also encompasses a much wider and more radical re-think of the way we support communities at a local level.

Over the past few years, this government, in lockstep with council leaders, have commenced the most ambitious devolution agenda in over 70 years.

We have made great breakthroughs and the Parliamentary Order laid literally just this week to unlock £900 million of investment for the Sheffield City Region while a new devolution deal, including over £1.1 billion of investment for West Yorkshire, was agreed and announced at Budget.

Once that new Mayor is elected in West Yorkshire, 41% of residents in England will be served by directly elected city region mayors, who each have the powers to stimulate job creation, build homes, improve transport and reduce local carbon emissions. 

In the North of England, that figure rises to 63%, with strong and effective Metro Mayors like Andy Burnham in Manchester and my friend Ben Houchen in the Tees Valley acting as powerful ambassadors for their regions.  
Well now is the time to finish what we’ve started.

I am delighted to confirm today that this government will be pressing ahead with the publication of our white paper on devolution and local recovery this autumn.

The white paper will connect local recovery with levelling up…

Providing a place-based strategy to boost regional economic performance in every corner of the country, from the Northern Powerhouse and the Midlands Engine to the Western Gateway and the Oxford-Cambridge Arc.

Our transformative plan will include a clear, ambitious strategy for strengthening our local institutions…

With many more elected mayors and more unitary councils following in the footsteps of Dorset, Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire.

So that we can remove the complexity of governance and reduce costs to the taxpayer while making space for town and parish councils to be genuinely empowered.

I’m acutely aware of the vital contribution that town and parish councils make to everyday life, whether it’s keeping public toilets open, running car parks or maintaining natural spaces which have been a lifeline to many throughout this time.

And I appreciate that there is a wealth of ideas to support the future of local government, devolution and its role in our national recovery. This includes the LGA Re-thinking Local Report and it’s only appropriate that we take the time to consider the series of important offers and asks that it makes of government.

More broadly my door is always open to those of you who I know will have ideas and reflections after long service in the sector and I want to take all of those into account.

The British state needs to become fully match-fit for the future.

I believe it’s right, as we work with you to remove the local barriers to recovery, that we shift power from Whitehall to people on the ground who know their areas so well, understand their priorities, and are empowered with the mandate, levers and agency to act upon them.

That is what our white paper on devolution and local recovery will seek to achieve, and I really do look forward to discussing it with you in more detail later in the year.

COVID-19 has undoubtedly dealt a heavy blow to our regional economies but it’s also underlined the reality that an overly centralised state is not, and never will be, best placed to respond effectively to the challenges that individual communities face.

I am not dogmatic on these issues, and we will always be led by the evidence.

Clearly, as we evolve a robust outcomes-led assessment framework will be key to our wider strategy.

But my own experience as an MP from the devolved region gives me great confidence that our national recovery should be founded upon our local endeavours.

Even after the worst of COVID-19, the fundamentals of our economy remain very strong.

We are home to the world’s most innovative businesses, illustrious universities, dynamic entrepreneurs and scientists, exciting cities, historic towns and villages, and renowned heritage, countryside and culture.

The months ahead will be decisive in putting our country onto a new and accelerated growth trajectory, utilising those assets to level up and position the UK at the forefront of the global recovery.

We will need your support, and your passion and your expertise to unleash Britain’s potential and give everyone, in every corner of our country, the confidence that our best days lie ahead of us.","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government and Simon Clarke MP",2020-07-03,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/local-government-association-annual-conference-2020-minister-for-regional-growth-and-local-governments-speech"

Coronavirus press conference 26 April 2020.

Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference. 
I’m pleased to be joined today by Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England.

Before I update you on the latest developments in the food supply chain, let me first give you an update on the latest data from the COBR coronavirus data file. Through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:

669,850 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 29,058 tests carried out yesterday;
  152,840 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 4,463 cases since yesterday;
  15,953 people are currently in hospital with the coronavirus in the UK, down from 16,411 on 25 April.
And sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 20,732 have now died. That is an increase of 413 fatalities since yesterday.

We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of these victims.

At the beginning of the outbreak of this virus we saw significant problems in panic buying. That episode quickly subsided and food availability now is back to normal levels and has been for several weeks. All supermarkets have introduced social distancing measures to protect both their staff and their customers and it is essential that shoppers respect these measures.

The food supply chain has also seen a significant reduction in staff absence over recent weeks. As staff who had been self-isolating through suspected coronavirus symptoms have returned to work. So absence levels are down from a peak of typically 20% in food businesses three weeks ago to less than 10% at the end of last week and in some cases individual companies reporting absences as low as 6%.

We have put in place measures to support the clinically vulnerable. So far 500,000 food parcels have been delivered to the shielded group, that is those who cannot leave home at all due to a clinical condition that they have. In addition, the major supermarkets have agreed to prioritise delivery slots for those in this shielded group. So far over 300,000 such deliveries have been made, enabling people to shop normally and choose the goods that they want to buy.

We recognise that there are others who are not clinically vulnerable and therefore are not in that shielded group but who may also be in need of help. Perhaps through having a disability or another type of medical condition, or indeed, being unable to draw on family and neighbours to help them. We have been working with local authorities to ensure that those people can be allocated a volunteer shopper to help them get their food needs. Charities such as Age UK and others can now also make also direct referrals on the Good Samaritan App to locate volunteers for those in need.

Many supermarkets have taken steps to increase the number of delivery slots that they have. At the beginning of this virus outbreak there were typically 2.1 million delivery slots in the entire supermarket chain. That has now increased to 2.6 million, and over the next couple of weeks we anticipate that that will grow further to 2.9 million. So supermarkets have taken steps to increase their capacity but while this capacity has expanded, it will still not be enough to meet all of the demand that is out there.

Some supermarkets have already chosen to prioritise some vulnerable customers with a proportion of the delivers slots that they have and others have offered to work with us and also local authorities to help establish a referral system so that when somebody is in desperate need, a local authority is able to make a referral to make sure that they can get a priority slot.

As we look forward more generally towards the next stage in our battle against this virus, there are encouraging signs of progress, but before we consider it safe to adjust any of the current social distancing measures, we must be satisfied that we have met the five tests set out last week by the First Secretary.

Those tests mean that the NHS can continue to cope;


    that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently;
  
  
    that the rate of infection is decreasing; and operational challenges have been met;
  
  
    and, most important of all, that there is no risk of a second peak.
  
For now, the most important thing we can all do to stop the spread of the coronavirus is to stay at home, to protect the NHS and save lives.

I want to pay tribute to all those who are working throughout the food supply chain from farmers, manufacturers and retailers. The response of this industry to ensure that we have the food that we need has been truly phenomenal.

"78","Speech","Tackling the diverse challenges of COVID-19: Lord Ahmad's statement at UNGA 2020","Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon spoke at the United Nations Security Council high level open debate on Maintenance of International Peace and Security.","Thank you, President Issoufou, and thank you to Niger for convening this very important meeting. May I firstly join with others in thanking you, Secretary-General, for your valuable insights and also commend your efforts at leading us through this global pandemic. I also wish to thank his excellency Moussa Faki Mahamat for his contribution and the specific focus and insight he brought from across Africa and the response of the African Union.

And if I may, Mr President, I want to start with positives. As we face challenges, we often forget what has truly been achieved. The United Nations system, including importantly the World Health Organisation, has responded quickly to health, humanitarian and socio-economic needs, and deployed around the globe in places that are home to some of the world’s most vulnerable communities.

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have adapted their instruments to macroeconomic challenges posed by the pandemic, and worked importantly in partnership with the United Nations. And also the G20 moved swiftly to suspend debt service payments for the world’s poorest countries so that nations are supported in their direct efforts to protect lives first and to alleviate economic and financial crises.

And, as Minister for the Commonwealth, the 54 Commonwealth heads of government issued a joint statement setting out a full range of international priorities in response to the pandemic, committing to work to mitigate the effects. And if I may importantly also acknowledge GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, to which the United Kingdom recently pledged over $2 billion, that has seen nations coming together in search importantly for a solution to protect people with diseases.

Mr President, these examples show the international community, the global response, at its best – when we work together, when we meet our collective needs through multilateral working, through good faith and full cooperation between member states.

Yet, as much as this crisis has brought us together, there have been times when it has driven us apart. At times, geopolitics have tampered cooperation and hindered our agility. The pandemic has tested the international system like never before. It is therefore in our collective interest to ensure the multilateral system doesn’t just emerge from this crisis, but as it emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is stronger, more together, to cope with the challenges in the future.

There will be a time to reflect on the lessons of this pandemic and how we prepare better for the next challenge. The UN reforms implemented over the last 2 years have been shown to work and we must continue and strive to improve all our international organisations. But, Mr President, now is not the moment to reject international institutions. Those principles that emerged from one of the darkest periods of human history, as the Secretary General reminded us, are needed again to bring us out of the lockdown and back into the light.

Preventing the indirect effects of this pandemic may prove harder still, with implications for international peace and security. We know, for instance, that the hundreds of millions of people around the world face food insecurity. And sadly, this will get worse. Therefore global cooperation is both critical and necessary to avoid catastrophe. And that is why the United Kingdom has made a call to action to prevent famine, with $150 million of new funding on top of the $1 billion we have already contributed to the international response. We have also appointed a new special envoy on famine prevention, Nick Dyer, and we urge all member states to support our collective efforts.

To conclude, Mr President, let me assure all colleagues, all partners, all member states, that the UK stands strongly by the values of the UN Charter. We believe strongly in its principles of peaceful international cooperation and, importantly, respect for human rights. This year, as we commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary, we should all reaffirm our commitment to these valuable principles and in doing so, rebuild, equipped and support to ensure that we come together to tackle the challenges and avail the opportunities that lie ahead.

Thank you, Mr President.","Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon",2020-09-24,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/tackling-the-diverse-challenges-of-covid-19"
"79","Speech","Foreign Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 29 April 2020","Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab gave the 29 April 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 29 April 2020: Coronavirus press conference 29 April 2020

Welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference. I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Jonathan Van Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, and also Professor Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England.

Let me just start by saying, I think on behalf of us all, huge congratulations to the Prime Minister and to Carrie on the wonderful news of the birth of their baby boy. I’ve spoken to the Prime Minister and I can tell you that both mum and son are doing really well.

Next, let me give an update on the latest data on coronavirus from our COBR data file.

I can report that, through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today, there have now been:


    818,539 tests for the virus across the UK, including 52,429 tests that took place yesterday
  
  
    165,221 people have tested positive, and that’s an increase of 4,076 cases on yesterday’s number
  
As the Health Secretary announced yesterday, from today, we are moving to an improved daily reporting system for deaths, so that deaths in all settings are included, wherever the individual has tested positive for COVID-19, rather than just those in hospitals.

And those figures show that, up to yesterday, on the new measure, we have recorded an additional 3,811 deaths in total and I think it is just important to say that those additional deaths were spread over the period from the 2nd March to 28th April, so they don’t represent a sudden surge in the number of deaths.

Sadly today’s figures show an additional 765 deaths compared to yesterday. I will let Professor Doyle talk us through the data in detail. I think we must never lose sight of the fact that behind every statistic, there are many human lives that have been tragically lost before their time.

We also pay tribute, of course, to those caring for the sick, and yesterday at 11am the whole country observed a minute’s silence, a moment to reflect on the sacrifice of all of our frontline workers who have died whilst dedicating themselves to caring for others and serving others.

On 16 April, I set out 5 principles that would guide our approach to the transition away from the current set of social distancing measures in place, and into a second phase.

We continue to see evidence in the data of a flattening of the peak of the virus, which is only happening because we have delivered on two of the central pillars of our strategic approach to defeating coronavirus.

First, we reinforced our NHS capacity, through the Nightingale hospitals, extra critical care capacity, more ventilator beds and extra doctors and nurses on the frontline.

And, second, we introduced social distancing measures, at the right time, guided by the scientific and medical evidence.

The public’s overwhelming support for those rules has helped to save lives and protect the NHS from becoming overwhelmed. We are still coming through the peak, and this, as I have said before, is a delicate and dangerous moment in this crisis. So, I know that a lot of people have made a lot of sacrifices, which is why it is so important that we don’t let up now and risk undoing all of that hard work.

So as we look to the future, our 5 tests remain key.

First, we must continue to boost NHS capacity, preventing it from being overwhelmed.

Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the number of deaths.

Thirdly, we must see further reductions in the rate of infection to manageable levels, across all the relevant areas and settings.

Fourth, we must be confident that the NHS will be able to cope with future demands, including as a result of any changes to existing measures or new measures we need to take.

Fifth, and this is probably the most critical of all, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that could overwhelm the NHS.

A second spike would be harmful to public health, resulting in many more deaths from COVID-19. That itself would lead to a second lockdown, inflicting further prolonged economic pain on the country. And, as the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said last week, that would not just be economically dangerous, it would inflict a serious blow to public confidence.

This issue of a second spike and the need to avoid it – it’s not a theoretical risk, and it is not confined to the UK.

Having relaxed restrictions in Germany over the past week, they have seen a rise in the transmission rate of coronavirus. And Chancellor Merkel has said publically, and she has made it clear, that they might need a second lockdown in Germany if the infection rate continues to rise.

So, this risk is very real, and it is vital that we proceed carefully, guided by the scientific advice, so that our next step through this crisis is a sure-footed one.

We mustn’t gamble away the sacrifices and progress we’ve made. We must continue to follow the scientific evidence, and we must continue to take the right decisions at the right moment in time.

We are working on all of the potential options for a second phase. There is light at the end of the tunnel – whether you are an NHS worker on the front line working tirelessly shift after shift, or a parent at home with young children. But we need to be patient and careful as we come through this moment of maximum risk.

So, we will wait for SAGE’s next review of the data in early May.

We’re ramping up the testing, with capacity now at over 73,000 per day, and 52,429 tests carried out per day, and eligibility for those tests has now been expanded further, to include anybody who needs to go to work and can’t work remotely, and who has symptoms. It also includes anyone over 65 with symptoms and all care home residents, as well as care home staff.

And at the same time as we ramp up the testing capacity, we’ll keep working on our tracking and tracing capability which will be a key component in the next phase of the crisis.

We will continue to source ventilators and personal protective equipment at home and abroad.

Paul Deighton is leading the national effort to increase domestic production and supply.

We continue to source PPE from abroad setting ourselves out as the international buyer of choice. In the last 10 days, we have secured over 5 million masks from China, we’ve had three flights with gowns from Turkey – because we know that every single one of those items of PPE is needed by those working so hard on the front line, both in the NHS and also in our care homes.

Our international effort is not confined to procurement.

I can tell you we have also made huge progress in returning UK nationals, who otherwise would have been at risk of being stranded abroad. Since the outbreak in Wuhan, we have helped and estimated 1.3 million Britons return on commercial flights.

And we have done that by working with the airlines and with those governments to make sure that the flights can run and that the airspace is kept open.

And we have brought back over 200,000 Brits back from Spain, 50,000 back from Australia, and over 11,000 from Pakistan, to name but just 3 countries.

As well as those commercial flights, we have also chartered flights, where commercial options weren’t possible, and we have now reached the stage where we have brought back over 20,000 British nationals on 99 flights from 21 countries and territories. That includes over 9,000 UK nationals back from India, 2,000 home from South Africa, and 1,200 from Peru.

In terms of repatriations it is worth also just bearing in mind that on the 17th March, when we changed our travel advice for those travelling on cruise ships, there were something like 19,000 British passengers on 60 cruise ships sailing around the world.

And as border restrictions were put in place by country after country, we faced a daunting task in getting our people home. But, we stuck at it, and 6 weeks later, we have now got all 19,000 British passengers back home safe and sound.

That was an enormous effort, and we recognise that the job is not done yet. And we will continue this unprecedented effort, with further charter flights from New Zealand, Pakistan and Bangladesh, amongst others, over the next week or so. So, I must pay tribute to the outstanding work of the consular teams working night and day at the FCO in London and at our embassies and high commissions around the world.

Finally, the Health Secretary announced last week that UK trials have started, as we draw on the incredible scientific talent we have in this country to pursue a vaccine.

And that effort too has an international dimension to it.

So, today, we announced that the UK will provide GAVI the international vaccine alliance with the equivalent of £330 million each year over the next 5 years as we seek to develop a vaccine both to protect the British people, but also to help immunise millions of the poorest and most vulnerable people around the world, combining the depth of our innovative know-how, with the big-hearted determination that has characterised our national effort to defeat the coronavirus.

Hello there. It’s a pleasure to be joining you today.

It’s fair to say that 2020 is a year that few of us will forget.

Through the storms we have weathered, I think we have learned a lot – not least reminding ourselves of the absolutely central role that our homes and communities play in our health and general wellbeing.

For many, the chance to spend more time with the people they love and getting to know their neighbourhoods has been a real ray of hope in a difficult period.

But for those less fortunate - stuck in poor, cramped accommodation, with few shops or parks and open spaces nearby, struggling to pay the rent or who, worst of all, have no home of their own at all - the pandemic has unquestionably been one of the darkest periods.

They deserve better.

That’s why – as we recover from the pandemic – we are absolutely determined to build back better and to deliver the homes we need with a comprehensive plan for a brighter future.

Your work - in local authorities and housing associations – is fundamental to helping us achieve these ambitions.

And I’m immensely grateful for all your efforts.

Like you, I want to see Britain emerging a stronger, better country from the pandemic. That we beat the pandemic and we move forward with confidence and optimism, learning lessons from the experience that we’ve been through as a country, as we have in previous times of great adversity.

That means, just as we did in those periods, like during and after the First and Second World War, it means building homes at scale and at pace, and helping more people – more of the hard-working families and prospective first-time buyers across the country - onto the housing ladder.

I know that this is, and I hope you share this, one of the defining challenges of our generation. We must act to ensure the young and future generations that will follow will have the same opportunities, the same security, the same stake in society as those who came before them.

We’re making progress.

Last year we built over 241,000 homes – more new homes than at any time in the last 30 years – taking the total delivered, since 2010 to 1.5 million.

The proportion of young homeowners increased after declining for more than a decade.

But lost months this year due to the pandemic will set us back significantly. As may the economic harm to come – the scale of which we don’t yet know. But the market has proven more resilient and robust than many would have predicted, helped in part by cut in stamp duty at the Budget at the beginning of summer. But there’s a great deal of uncertainty and there’s a lot more for us to do.

More broadly, looking to the horizon beyond the immediate challenges presented by Covid and the economic disruption that we find ourselves in today.

There’s still a great deal more to do to help those trapped paying high rents who are struggling to save for a deposit to enjoy homeownership or even to enjoy the security and the dignity that comes with a secure home of their own, whether that be owned or rented.

Affordability remains a very big issue across the board.

Affordable Homes Programme (AHP) announcement

That’s why, earlier this week, I was delighted to announce details of the £12 billion Affordable Homes Programme.

This includes a new £11.5 billion Programme - the highest single funding commitment to affordable housing in a decade.

Now, we all know the economic outlook is uncertain and that the pandemic has caused huge disruption to your development plans, as it has more broadly.

Mindful of this, the new Programme aims to deliver up to 180,000 affordable homes over five years from 2021 to 2026 – the first from next year - right across the country.

These include homes for Social Rent, more than in the previous programme - underlining our commitment to the most vulnerable in our society.

And they include, most notably, significant extra support for home ownership at a price that people on modest incomes can actually afford.

Around half of the homes delivered will be available to own, with the rest available for discounted rent, including 10% for supported housing – to help those with physical or mental health challenges.

As part of this new approach, we’re making home ownership more accessible and flexible, with the vast majority of the homes available through the new model of Shared Ownership.

Under the this model, I have lowered the initial stake from 25% to 10%, and reduced the minimum staircasing requirements to 1%, or as low as £1000, which will make it easier for people to get onto and climb the housing ladder.

I have also introduced a 10-year “repair-free” period during which the shared owner will not have to pay repairs or maintenance costs.

These much-needed changes will help bridge the gap between renting and home ownership and build on the introduction of the Right to Shared Ownership – our new scheme which will give many housing association tenants the opportunity, in time, to buy a stake in their home using the new model for Shared Ownership.

So with the accompanying funding guidance having just been published by Homes England, I encourage you to read it, consider it, and start preparing your bids and above all, to think big. At times like this, we need you – we need you to get building.

Taken together, these measures will benefit families across the country, with almost £7.5 billion of the investment to be delivered outside London – over £2 billion more than under the previous Programme – but still offering the Greater London Authority and the Mayor of London £4 billion to get building in London as well.

We are doing this because we as a government were elected with a commitment to levelling up and ensuring that opportunities are available to people across the country.

First Homes

For the stake in society that we want to offer to people to be meaningful, it’s vital that we offer our children the ability to put down roots in the places they grew up, and that we allow people who are key workers in those communities to get on the housing ladder. If we’ve learned anything from the last few months, it is the absolute importance of those key workers – whether they be teachers, nurses, junior doctors, police and fire, veterans in the armed forces and others.

The simple truth is that too many will continue to get priced out of their own areas where they live and work and want to put down roots, unless we take action– and that’s precisely what we’re doing through what I think could be our life-changing initiative – the  First Homes policy.

Under this scheme, local first-time buyers can buy homes at a discount of at least 30% in their local communities, with councils able to put key workers at the front of the queue.

The discount could save them as much as £100,000 on the price of an average newly built property in England. And where the costs of property are highest, the discounts could be as much as 50%.

Furthermore, the discount will apply to the new home forever so buyers and the community will continue to benefit every time the property is sold for generations to come, not merely enriching one generation.

We’re keen for people to benefit as soon as possible but we want to make sure that we get the details right, so we’ve confirmed plans to accelerate the roll out of First Homes with a 1,500 home pilot, funded by the new Affordable Homes Programme, with more details to follow very soon.

To keep up the momentum on delivery, we will set an expectation that 25% of the affordable homes delivered through developer contributions will be First Homes.

All of which adds up to more young people, more families and more key workers being able to have the opportunity to own a home of their own.

Modern Methods of Construction

But whether we’re aiming to help more people onto the housing ladder, people who are renting or, crucially, who are homeless or sleeping rough, we will only succeed if we build more homes.

And that’s what we’re setting out to do, and you play an absolutely crucial role in our plans.

As a result of the bold steps we’ve taken - like lifting the HRA cap and providing longer-term rent stability – there’s never been a better or more important time to build at any point. When there’s been an economic disruption or recession, housing and development has plaid a crucial role in our economic recovery, and councils and housing associations in particular have led the charge.

This central role that you could play was reinforced this week by the announcement of my colleague, Lord Agnew, that we’re putting £30 million into helping councils create thousands of new homes and jobs by unlocking surplus land for development, Authorities will be able to bid for £20 million for remediation works and infrastructure through the Land Release Fund, which focuses on small sites and SME builders, with £10 million available via the One Public Estate programme to support the earliest stages of development.

I urge you to seize this, and the many other opportunities now at hand, to help your communities recover from the pandemic by delivering not just more homes, but more beautiful, more sustainable, better quality homes in all parts of the country.

Homes that are delivered more quickly, harnessing the latest technology and innovation as well. That’s why we’re making Modern Methods of Construction central to the delivery of the new Affordable Homes Programme, with new measures to help the providers build a pipeline of supply and boost the market.

We’ve set a minimum target for the use of MMC in the programme and we’re going to review that target annually with a view to increasing it if market conditions allow. We want the UK to be a leader in MMC, driving new jobs, better skills, as well as faster delivery of homes, and those homes, in turn, being better quality and more energy efficient, with all of the benefits of society and social justice that comes with that.

Planning reforms

Homes that are built in the places people want to live – near jobs, near good public transport, near green spaces and beautiful spaces for people to enjoy, and other amenities.

I am confident that the landmark planning reforms that the Prime Minister and I set out at the beginning of the summer– and which the Housing Minister spoke about in more detail to you just a few days ago – will help us deliver this and – contrary to the somewhat knee-jerk reaction of some– even more affordable homes.

To that end, we’re proposing to replace the current system of planning obligations and the Community Infrastructure Levy with a nationally-set value-based flat rate charge on development under the new system.

These changes will give local authorities greater powers to determine how developer contributions are used, will ensure that developers do contribute and cut out those lengthy and at times demoralising debates about viability and in the end how much developers can actually contribute.

And through the new ‘Infrastructure Levy’ we will raise more revenue than now by capturing a greater share of the land value uplift – an explicit decision and commitment that this government has made.

And why are we doing that? We’re doing it to deliver more infrastructure and more affordable housing than ever before.

And we want to work with the sector to iron out the details, to get those ‘I’s dotted and ‘T’s crossed, so that we can make sure this actually works for you and we deliver on that commitment.

And we want to ensure as well that in doing this, in designing this simpler system, that as much, if not more, onsite affordable housing is delivered as present, because we want mixed communities – we want vibrant places where people of different incomes and different ages and different backgrounds can live together as one. That, in the end, is the definition of a community.

So, in all, issues around affordability are higher than ever on our agenda – as are those relating to safety, which has to be of paramount concern as well.

Building safety / Social Housing White Paper

It is absolutely essential that people are safe and they feel safe in their homes.

And I want to thank all of you very sincerely for keeping up on the momentum on vital building safety works during these times.

Yes, works were paused at the beginning of the pandemic, but they’ve come back and we now need to focus very hard this Autumn on ensuring that dangerous cladding in particular is removed from the remaining buildings where it needs to be, and that workers are on site on each and every one of those buildings as quickly as possible.

We’ve made an extra £1 billion available, thanks to the Chancellor’s support in the Budget, to make buildings safe and are introducing the biggest change to building safety in a generation through the Building Safety Bill, which is now being scrutinised by parliament and will be brough forward for debate and legislation very soon.

Residents and their voices are quite rightly at the heart of these reforms – which is also true of the Social Housing White Paper, which I am committed to taking forward this year.

We made the decision to pause it during the pandemic because we wanted it to achieve the prominence that it truly deserves, and that tenants in social housing have the opportunity to hear and understand quite how significant this paper and the new changes that it will bring forward could be for them.

This Paper will set out measures to further empower tenants and boost the supply and quality of social housing, with greater redress and better more meaningful regulation of the sector.

Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of where they live, and regardless of the terms on which they live there – whether you’re a homeowner, whether that’s freehold or leasehold, whether you’re a tenant with a housing association or local council – you deserve respect, and we want to ensure, in the limited cases where that isn’t happening, that things change, and they change forever.

Rough sleeping

That’s why, because we’re concerned to ensure that housing of a good standard is available to everyone, and that everybody is treated with dignity and respect, particularly the most vulnerable in society, through our response to Covid-19, we’ve focused so hard on supporting those sleeping rough and other vulnerable groups.

Thanks to a strong effort between central and local government, I’m proud that we’ve helped almost 15,000 vulnerable people into safer accommodation – thereby protecting hundreds, if not thousands of lives.

Any life lost is a tragedy, but the statistics that the Office of National Statistics compiled earlier this summer did show that the record of this country is the best, or amongst the best, of any country in the world for protecting the lives of those who were sleeping rough at the beginning of the pandemic.

That was a precious silver lining in the otherwise dark cloud of the pandemic. It’s one that takes us significantly further towards our ambition of ending rough sleeping. For the first time in my lifetime, by and large we know where rough sleepers are, we know who they are, we know what other challenges we face, because rough sleeping is as much a crisis of mental health and addiction as it is of housing.

I’m determined to ensure that as few people as possible from that cohort return to life on the streets and, with that in mind, with the support of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, we’ve secured longer-term funding for accommodation – 3,300 homes this year, many more to follow in the years ahead.

These homes, and those to come later form a £400 million next steps accommodation programme which I hope will establish a new national asset.

A set of move on accommodation specifically targeted a those who have been sleeping rough, tracked - so we can ensure that it ensured and doesn’t get whittled away by circumstance – and monitored – so we can see the progress or otherwise that we’re making towards turning peoples’ lives around and tackling rough sleeping.

This is inspired by the original work done in the early 1990s by my then predecessor George Young and by many charities that are still going strong today, to create the programme then, the Clearing House, in what I hope will be a lasting memorial to the challenges of the pandemic, helping us to support people in their hour of need for many, many, years to come. We’ve received applications for this and we want to work with you now to deliver those homes at pace.

We’ve also provided significant additional funding for rough sleeping in addition to the other schemes that we announced earlier this year and in the spending review.

We have the funding in place for this financial year, and it’s very significant. The challenge now is to recapture the zeal and the vision and the collegiality that we had at the beginning of the pandemic and work together as central and local government, as housing associations, as charities and indeed anyone who cares about tacking rough sleeping, to ensure that we put in place the programmes and the homes.

And we work so that this autumn and winter we continue to protect those individuals who we did through the Everyone In programme and others who flow onto the streets as a result of the challenges we now face, and that we make this autumn and winter one in which far fewer people are sleeping rough on the streets that were last winter, and certainly more than would be had we not created this effort at the beginning of the pandemic.

And I need your help and support to do that, and you have my absolute commitment that this is something that I am determined to work with you on and achieve.

Environmental standards / Accessibility consultation

As well as building more homes, I want to see us building greener, more beautiful homes that create sustainable places for which we can all be proud to hand on to the next generation.

This is, again, one of the main aims of our planning reforms, and an element of them that I am particularly committed to and home will be a legacy of this government to future generations – the creation of a planning system fit for the 21st century, genuinely centred on the principles of good design and place-making and a more harmonious relationship between the built and natural environments.

This means a “fast track for beauty”. It means mandating tree-lined streets. It means design codes created by local communities – not just at local authority level, but at neighbourhood or even street level as well.  It means taking inspiration from the fantastic work of the Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission – a golden thread I think you can see throughout Planning for the Future.

The UK is the first major economy in the world to pass a net zero emissions target into law and our Future Homes Standard will help to meet this.

From 2025 all new homes will be expected to have at least 75% lower carbon emissions and be zero carbon ready without the need for expensive retrofitting – representing real action to protect our environment and tackle climate change. If we can realistically go further, faster, I will certainly champion that within government and seek to achieve it with your support and encouragement.

Furthermore, more green homes must also be more accessible homes to meet the needs of an ageing population.

That’s why I was pleased to launch a consultation this week which I would draw your attention to on raising accessibility standards for all new homes – an important step in taking the National Strategy for Disabled People forward and ensuring everyone can play a full role in the life of this country, and that homes can truly be fit for your whole life.

Conclusion

Because whether you’re determined to live independently for longer or just starting out, raising a family or want to move for a better job and better opportunities, this government must be behind you – and it is.

And behind all of you, in councils and housing associations - to get Britain building and not just help realise so many individual hopes and dreams, but power our economic and social recovery as well, as beat  the pandemic and move forward with renewed hope and confidence about the future.

We’re on track to achieve this:

building more homes – more affordable homes,
  getting more people onto the housing ladder,
  putting beauty, quality, the environment at the heart of a faster, simpler, more predictable planning system,
  driving jobs and growth and skills through a more diverse, more competitive housing industry, not just in the hands of big developers or volume housebuilders but in the hands of small and medium sized builders and entrepreneurs in all parts of the country
  building where affordability is most challenging, such as London and the South East, but also levelling up and renewing and regenerating our great towns and cities as well.
This is what it means to level up. That’s what it means to unite our country.

And with your help, that’s what we will deliver.

Thank you.","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government and The Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP",2020-09-11,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/robert-jenricks-speech-to-chartered-institute-of-housing-cih-2020"

Coronavirus press conference 6 April 2020.

Good afternoon, welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press conference. I’m joined by our Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, Chris it’s good to have you back. And also by Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser Angela Maclean.

And before Angela gives us an update on the data, I would like to update you on the steps that the government is taking to defeat the coronavirus.

Our step-by-step action plan is aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, and that will protect the NHS’s ability to cope. At each point, we have been following scientific and medical advice and we’ve been very deliberate in our actions, taking the right measures at the right moment.

We are taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity, by dramatically expanding the numbers of beds, key staff and equipment on the front-line, to give people the care they need, when they need it most. That is also why we are instructing people to stay at home, so we can protect our NHS and save lives.

I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:


    208,837 people have now been tested for the virus
  
  
    51,608 have tested positive
  
  
    the number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms now stands at 17,911
  
  
    and of those who have contracted the virus 5,373 sadly have died
  
Our thoughts, our deepest condolences are with their loved ones at this very difficult time.

These figures are a powerful reminder of why we need everyone to follow the government’s guidance. We must stay at home, to protect our NHS and to save lives.

As you will know, last night, the Prime Minister was admitted to hospital for tests following advice from his doctor. This was a precautionary step, because he continues to have persistent coronavirus symptoms, ten days after first having tested positive for the virus.

I can tell you that the PM had a comfortable night in hospital, and he’s in good spirits. He’s still in hospital under observation. He is being given regular updates on developments, and he continues to lead the government.

I can reassure the British people that the government remains united in a single overriding priority, which is to defeat the coronavirus and see this nation through the challenge ahead.

In the last week under the Prime Minister’s leadership:


    the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove has explained what we are doing to boost manufacturing capability here at home, to meet the rising demand for ventilators and other equipment in the NHS
  
  
    Business Secretary Alok Sharma has been setting what the government is doing to support small businesses
  
  
    and yesterday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave an update on what we are doing to bolster capacity in the NHS, including increasing the number of critical care beds
  
The FCO is supporting all of these operational priorities.

So we’re deploying the diplomatic network right around the world, to source and buy ventilators and protective equipment, so that we can reinforce the NHS frontline here at home.

At the same time, we’re working with other governments and the airlines to bring home as many stranded British nationals as we possibly can, prioritising our most vulnerable citizens.

On commercial flights we’ve helped over 200,000 UK nationals come home from Spain, 13,000 from Egypt, 8,000 from Indonesia.

We’ve also chartered flights from 7 different countries, bringing home more than 2,000 British nationals.

We’ve repatriated a further 1,550 from cruise ships, including most recently the Coral Princess and the Zaandam.

And for those travellers still stuck abroad, we’re doing everything we can to keep international airports open, to keep commercial flights running, and to charter flights, when there are no other options – under the new arrangements I announced last week, and which have now been agreed with 14 airlines.

We’ve allocated £75 million to support those arrangements. We’ve already had flights back from countries including Peru, Ghana, and Tunisia.

And we’re fixing further flights from India, South Africa, Nepal and the Philippines, which will fly later on this week.

So, I want to reassure people that every arm of government is doing everything it possibly can to defeat coronavirus and rise to the challenges it presents us at home and abroad.

Last night, Her Majesty the Queen reflected on the national spirit of unity and resolve that we are seeing in our country, as well as the collective effort we need to tackle the disease. From our heroic doctors, nurses and careworkers, through to those manning the tills at supermarkets and pharmacies, those driving the lorries and the buses. They are all worthy of our applause, they are all worthy of our admiration.

And on that note, both the Prime Minister and I would like to thank all the NHS staff for their truly heroic work and we urge the public to continue to follow the government’s advice to:

stay at home
  protect the NHS
  and save lives
And on that note, I will pass over to Angela for an update on the latest data.

Coronavirus press conference 9 April 2020.

Good afternoon, welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m joined by Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer and Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser.

Can I start with an update on the Prime Minister. He is still in intensive care but he continues to make positive steps forward and he’s in good spirits.

I can also report from the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme that, as of today:

243,421 people have now been tested for the virus
  65,077 have tested positive, and
  the number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms now stands at 16,784
  of those who have contracted the virus, 7,978 have sadly died and our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends
The whole country has been practicing a stringent form of social distancing for 3 weeks now. Precisely because we’re doing everything we can to minimise the bleak numbers that I just read out and, for that, I want to say a massive thank you to everyone who has gone the extra mile during this very challenging period.

Thank you to all of those who are looking after us in our time of need.

The NHS workers on the front line who have treated the sick, saved lives and tended for those who, sadly, could not be saved.

For the doctors and nurses who have died of coronavirus whilst caring for others, we will never forget their sacrifice, we will never forget their devotion to helping others.

And I also want to say a big thank you to the carers, the charity workers, all those who are looking after, or even just keeping an eye on, those in their local neighbourhood. You are the lifeline to so many people in our communities.

Thank you to the workers who keep the country running, the supermarket workers, the delivery drivers, the technicians, the cleaners, the public servants who just kept going, determined to keep providing the daily services we all rely on.

I think you’ve certainly made us all think long and hard about who the ‘key workers’ are in our lives.

Thank you to the volunteers who have stepped up across the country, whose big-hearted sense of responsibility defines British community spirit at its very best.

And a massive thank you to every single person who has stayed home to stop this terrible virus from spreading, you have helped protect the NHS, and you have helped to save lives.

Now, as we look forward to the long bank-holiday Easter weekend, I know some people are going to start wondering is it time to ease up on the rules.

So I’ve got to say thank you for your sacrifice. But, also, we’re not done yet. We must keep going.

Let me just explain a little bit about why that is so important.

Today, I chaired a COBR meeting with senior ministers, officials and representatives from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as the Mayor of London, so that we could take stock and assess where we are right across the United Kingdom. And at this stage, the government is continuing to gather all of the relevant data to obtain the fullest picture possible of the effect of the social distancing measures we have put in place.

Now, while the early signs suggest that they are having the impact we need to see, it’s too early to say that conclusively.

SAGE will meet next week to discuss the latest evidence, and we will keep the measures we have put in place under review. And as we’ve said on many occasions now, we will be guided by the science at all times. So we don’t expect to be able to say more on this until the end of next week.

Let me just be, again, very clear about this. The measures will have to stay in place, until we’ve got the evidence that clearly shows we have moved beyond the peak.

I know these restrictions take their toll, day in day out. On people’s livelihoods, on people’s quality of life, on people’s mental health. And I appreciate that it’s often the little things that hurt the most.

With the Easter bank holiday coming up, I would normally spend it with my 2 boys, 7- and 5-year-old boys, with their grandparents doing an Easter egg hunt. And I know there is going to be lots of people who would normally be planning a family get together or just getting out in the sunshine with friends and loved ones.

Unfortunately, right now, we just can’t do those sorts of things. And I am really sorry about that.

But take a moment to think of the progress we’ve already made, Following the guidance, staying home, denying this virus what it needs, to spread more easily and to kill more people.

It’s been almost 3 weeks, and we’re starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we’ve all made. But the deaths are still rising, and we haven’t yet reached the peak of the virus. So it’s still too early to lift the measures that we’ve put in place. We must stick to the plan. And we must continue to be guided by the science.

Our top priority, our immediate priority, remains to slow the spread of the virus and to save as many lives as possible. That’s why we have to ask you to continue to ask you all to keep complying with the guidance. As we’ve said consistently from the outset, it is vital we take the right decisions at the right time.

And the most important thing right now is that people continue to follow the government’s guidance until we’ve got the evidence that the virus is firmly under control. So that means please do stay at home, to protect our NHS and to save lives. After all the efforts that everyone’s made, after all the sacrifices so many people have made, let’s not ruin it now.

Let’s not undo the gains we’ve made. Let’s not waste the sacrifices so many people have made. We mustn’t give the coronavirus a second chance to kill more people and hurt our country. I know it’s tough going. But this is a team effort, and we’ll only defeat this virus for good if we all stay the course.

So please stay home this bank holiday weekend. For everyone’s sake.


Read guidance on staying at home (social distancing) and find out more about what you can and cannot do.

Good afternoon.

Welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.

I’m pleased to be joined today by Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England.

And again by Sir Peter Hendy, Chair of Network Rail, directing the restart of our transport system.

Let me begin by updating you on the latest information from the Government’s COBR file.

The first slide shows the latest information on infections.

Results from the ONS infection survey published this morning estimate that the number of people who tested positive for coronavirus in England fell from 152,000 between 27 April and 10 May, to 33,000 between 25 May and 7 June.

This is encouraging progress and suggests that around 1 in 1,700 people in the community had coronavirus during the latest period of the survey.

SAGE has also confirmed today that their estimate of the R rate for the UK is unchanged on last week, at 0.7-0.9. We want to keep the R number below 1.0. R is the average number of additional people infected by each infected person.

The second slide shows cases confirmed with a test:

6,434,713 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 193,253 tests carried out or posted out yesterday.

292,950 people have tested positive, an increase of 1,541 cases since yesterday. The graph shows a steadily falling number of identified cases on a 7-day rolling average, despite the increase in testing.

The third slide shows the latest data from hospitals.

535 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 9 June, down from 722 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April.

392 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 571 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.

The fourth slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country.

There are now 5,607 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 20% from 7,036 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,697 on 12 April.

As the graphs show, while there is some variation, most nations and regions of the UK are broadly following a similar pattern.

The fifth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus.

Across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 41,481. That’s an increase of 202 fatalities since yesterday.

When measured by a 7-day rolling average, the daily number of deaths currently stands at 174, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.

Although the number of deaths is now firmly down, our deepest sympathies go out to all those who have lost loved ones.

Transport is instrumental to our recovery….

To connect people with jobs…

To help level up Britain….

And even to make us a healthier, and more active nation.

But as people start to travel, transport also presents one of our biggest challenges…

How we protect passengers. Prevent the spread of the virus. Even as we become more mobile.

Transport use may be the first occasion since the onset of COVID that we’ve shared confined spaces with others.

So it’s critical that we all take a vigilant and cautious approach over the next few weeks.

I’m just going to say this…

If you can work from home, you should continue to do so.

If you cannot work from home, you should try to avoid public transport.

If you must use public transport, you should travel at quieter times of day.

And if you’re an employer, you should do everything in your power to prevent staff from travelling… unless it’s absolutely vital…

…and please do allow staff to travel at quieter times.

From Monday (15 June 2020), it becomes mandatory in England to wear a face covering on public transport – that includes trains, buses, trams, ferries and planes.

A ‘face covering’ does not mean a surgical mask.

Face coverings can be made at home and you can find the guidance at GOV.UK.

As we move to recovery, it’s more important than ever to protect each other…

Preventing those showing no symptoms from infecting others.

I know there’s huge public support for compulsory face coverings…

They show respect for our fellow travellers.

But for clarity, transport operators will be able to refuse permission to travel where someone isn’t using a face covering…

And this weekend I am taking powers through the Public Health Act leading to fines for non-compliance too.

We’ll take a gentle approach to enforcement during the first couple of days.

And help will be at hand.

In addition to British Transport Police, and staff working for Network Rail, TfL and Transport Operators…

In the coming weeks we’ll also deploy Journey Makers to assist and remind commuters of the need to wear a face covering…

Plus the Safer Transport campaign will provide plenty of reminders at bus stops, rail stations and on social media.

Remembering your face covering should be the same as picking up your phone, wallet or purse when you leave home.

Please read the guidance, ensure you have a face covering and protect your fellow commuters.

This crisis has tested our nation. Yet through adversity comes possibility…

A greener transport future within our grasp.

For example, through the £2 billion investment we’re making through the cycling and walking programme.

The challenge is to make transport…

Currently our biggest emitter of greenhouse gases…

Part of the solution, not the problem.

Take the aviation sector, which has had an impossible few months…

Yet, despite the obvious challenges, there’s a real determination within the industry to have a greener restart.

So we’re bringing together leaders from aviation, environmental groups and government…

To form the Jet Zero Council.

This group will be charged with making net zero emissions possible for future flights.

Our goal – within a generation – will be to demonstrate flight across the Atlantic, without harming the environment…

And today we’re backing a company called Velocys who are building a plant for aviation biofuels in Lincolnshire.

I’m also excited about a Cambridge University and Whittle Labs project to accelerate technologies for zero carbon flight.

The shared experience of fighting coronavirus has changed us in many ways.

Although it has forced us apart, it has also brought us together.

Although it has tested us, it has also shown us at our very best.

And although it has made us reflect on the past, it’s focussed on those plans for the future.

But now, as we become more mobile, we must not forget that this insidious virus is still a threat.

That not only means avoiding public transport if you can…

It also means from Monday, wearing a face covering on public transport.

Avoiding gatherings of more than 6 people…

Including to protest.

I understand that people want to show their passion for issues that they care deeply about.

And we must never be complacent about stamping out racism and discrimination in this country.

But please. For the sake of your health, and that of your friends and families. Don’t attend mass gatherings.

We’ve come a long way.

As we move towards recovery, let’s protect lives, as well as livelihoods.

I want to bring you up to speed on something that’s happening today which is that I’ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. That’s to say – a temperature and a persistent cough.

And, on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, I’ve taken a test. That has come out positive.

So I am working from home. I’m self-isolating. And that’s entirely the right thing to do.

But be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.

And I want to thank everybody who’s involved, I want to thank, above all, our amazing NHS staff. It was very moving last night to join in that national clap for the NHS.

But it’s not just the NHS, it’s our police, our social care workers, teachers, everybody who works in schools, DWP staff.

An amazing national effort by the public services. But also by every member of the British public who’s volunteering, an incredible response – 600,000 people have volunteered to take part in a great national effort to protect people from the consequences of coronavirus – I want to thank you.

I want to thank everybody who’s working to keep our country going through this epidemic.

And we will get through it.

And the way we’re going to get through it is, of course, by applying the measures that you’ll have heard so much about.

And the more effectively we all comply with those measures, the faster our country will come through this epidemic and the faster we’ll bounce back.

So thank you to everybody who’s doing what I’m doing, working from home, to stop the spread of the virus from household to household.

That’s the way we’re going to win, we’re going to beat it, and we’re going to beat it together.

The United Kingdom remains resolute in our commitment to combating all forms of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia.

It is fitting that this General Debate falls on the first day of Black British History month in the UK, where we seek to recognise and celebrate the contribution of Black people in the UK, empowering us to confront preconceptions about Britishness.

The UK has made great strides towards becoming a more tolerant society, but we have further to go. The Prime Minister recently announced a new Commission to look at inequality in the UK, which will review the areas of poverty, education, employment, health and the criminal justice system. The Commission will set out a new positive agenda for change - balancing the needs of individuals, communities and society, and seeking to ensure fairness for all.

Internationally, we remain dedicated to participating actively in anti racism-related UN mechanisms. Our efforts will continue to focus on the practical steps that states can take to combat racism. We are committed to working with other countries to share good practice and re-energise our joint efforts on this agenda.

Madam High Commissioner, this year we have witnessed a global movement calling for change.

Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s briefing. I’m pleased to be joined by Steve Powis - the National Medical Director at NHS England.

First, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.


    2,962,227 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 177,216 tests carried out yesterday;
  
  
    248,293 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,472 cases since yesterday;
  
  
    9,953 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down 13 % from 11,443 this time last week.
  
And sadly, of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 35,704 have now sadly died. That’s an increase of 363 fatalities since yesterday. Of course, my thoughts are with everyone of the families of those people who have been affected by this.

Before we begin questions from the public and from the media I just want to remind people of the details of the next phase of our fight against Coronavirus.

First, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System, with five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus.

The alert level will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.

And in turn that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place.

The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures.

Throughout the period of lockdown which started on March 23rd we have been at Level 4.

Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in careful steps.

We have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their normal way of life - but crucially while avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak which overwhelms the NHS.

After after each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.

Step 1 – as the PM announced this week:

Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work.
  You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like.
  You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay 2 metres apart.
Having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated what we are asking people to do, which is to Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives.

Yes - staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible. But there are a range of other actions we’re advising people to take.

People should Stay Alert, by:

working from home if you can;
  limiting contact with other people;
  keeping distance if you go out - 2 metres apart where possible;
  washing your hands regularly;
  wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant - for example in some shops and on public transport;
  and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate.
Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections.

This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.

Over the past months, we’ve all naturally been focused on the huge, life-or-death health implications of this pandemic.

But I’d now like to provide an update on some of the crucial work taking place behind the scenes to support and protect the things that give our lives added meaning - such as sport, art, tourism and our charities, music and theatre.

And when we look back on coronavirus, one of the things we’ll remember is the incredible contribution made by so many people.

As a way of showing our national gratitude to these everyday COVID heroes, we are announcing today that we are delaying Her Majesty The Queen’s Birthday honours list until the Autumn so that they can be recognised and celebrated.

And as the Prime Minister said today, I’m delighted that Her Majesty The Queen has approved a knighthood for Captain Tom Moore, in recognition of his outstanding achievement in raising nearly £33 million for NHS charities.

Captain Tom set a marker for generosity, and the public have matched it.

Incredibly, it looks as if British people and businesses have now contributed over £800 million - just through national fundraising campaigns alone - and a great deal more has obviously been raised at a local level.

As the British people have generously given both their time and money,  the government has sought to back them every step of the way. We promised to match every penny raised by the BBC’s Big Night In campaign and, after a fantastic public response, I’m delighted to announce today that over £70 million is now being distributed by Comic Relief, Children In Need and the National Emergencies Trust to charities on the frontline.

This comes on top of the hundreds of millions of pounds we’ve already announced for charities doing vital work to support those suffering with poor mental health, to help victims of domestic abuse, and to make sure hospices can continue to care for families in these most difficult circumstances.

And today, I am pleased to confirm that the Government’s dedicated support scheme  for small and medium sized charities - the Coronavirus Community Support Fund - will open for applications this week.

Initially there will be a £200 million tranche of government funding and this will be administered by the National Lottery Community Fund and will focus on those charities we may not know nationally, but are a lifeline to communities at a local level.

On top of that I can also announce that we are releasing £150 million from dormant accounts to help social enterprises get affordable credit to people who are financially vulnerable and support charities tackling youth unemployment.

Our charities, both large and small, have really been at the forefront of the national effort to defeat the coronavirus. And together this all amounts to a multi-billion pound boost for Britain’s charities.

I know people are also eager for news on the return of live sports and arts. The last few months have felt odd without them, and our calendars strangely bare.

Finding creative, crowd-free ways to navigate coronavirus is the biggest challenge for our recreation and leisure sectors right now.

So this week I am setting up a renewal taskforce which will help them bounce back. It will be made up of the brightest and the best from the creative, tech and sporting worlds. These are experts in their fields and they’ll be advising me on how to find new and different ways to get their industries back up and running. They include:

Alex Scott, a former Lioness and Olympian, and now an award winning broadcaster. She will help us think through how we can get sport back safely in a way that works for clubs, players and supporters alike.

Similarly Lord Grade, a former Chairman of both the BBC and ITV, will provide an insight into how we can get our creative and media industries back up and flourishing again.

Tamara Rojo, the English National Ballet’s Artistic Director, will give us ideas for how we start to get our arts scene back up and running.

And Martha Lane Fox, well-known as the founder of lastminute.com, will advise on how tech can power the recovery of all these sectors, but particularly in tourism, as part of the much wider role it will play in driving our economy forward, as it has done already.

Meanwhile, bit by bit, we are developing guidance that is helping some of the lighter bits of our economy return to a new normal.

So we have supported the safe return of TV production, meaning our broadcasters are able to keep some of our favourite shows on the TV screens, whether that’s Corry or Eastenders.

We’ve helped to reopen the country’s tennis and basketball courts, and guided elite athletes back into training safely - and that in turn will pave the way for the return of live sports behind closed doors in the near future.

Normal life as we have known it is still a long way off, and the path to get there is a narrow one.

But these things will return, when it is safe for them to do so, thanks to the same drive and creativity that makes a great performance or a great piece of art.

And I really think that when they do, and when we have overcome this crisis together, we will appreciate them that much more.","Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, Office for Civil Society, and The Rt Hon Oliver Dowden CBE MP",2020-05-20,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/oliver-dowdens-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-20-may-2020"

Coronavirus press conference 5 May 2020.

Welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m joined by Professor Angela McLean, Chief Scientific Advisor at the MOD.

First, let me give an update on the latest data that we have on coronavirus. I can report through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme that as of today:


    there have now been 1,383,842 tests for coronavirus across the UK, including 84,806 tests yesterday
  
  
    we know that 194,990 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 4,406 cases since yesterday
  
  
    and of those who have tested positive, 29,427 have very sadly died, and our hearts go out to everyone who has lost a loved one throughout the coronavirus challenge
  
We continue to see evidence of a flattening of the peak of this virus. But, as the figures that I have just read out show, it’s is not over yet. So, in the coming days, SAGE will be updating ministers with the latest scientific advice.

As ever, we will make sure that we continue to be guided by their advice as we take the decisions on next steps in fighting the virus. Alongside the advice from SAGE, our 5 tests remain absolutely key.


    first, we must continue to boost NHS capacity, so that the NHS cannot be overwhelmed
  
  
    second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the number of deaths
  
  
    thirdly, we must see further reductions in the rate of infection to manageable levels, across all different areas and settings
  
  
    fourth, we must be confident that the NHS will be able to cope with future demands, including as a result of any changes that we make to existing measures or indeed any new measures we might wish to take
  
  
    fifth, and above all, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that could then overwhelm the NHS
  
Later on this week, the Prime Minister will update the country on the measures and decisions we will need to take to protect the NHS, to safeguard the economy and avoid the risk of a second peak that would be damaging both for public health, but also for jobs and the wider economy.

As we consider the decisions we will take next, to protect life, but also to protect our way of life, it’s now clear that the second phase will be different. We will need to adjust to a new normal where we as a society adapt to safe new ways to work, to travel, to interact and to go about our daily lives,

We’ve never experienced anything like this first stage of COVID-19, in terms of the scale of the lives lost but also the lockdown that it has required. As we go forward, we want to make sure that the next phase is more comfortable, is more sustainable and prevents lasting damage to jobs and livelihoods.

But we need to be under no illusions, the next stage won’t be easy. And if we’re going to protect life and preserve our way of life we must continue to be guided by the scientific advice we receive, and make sure the next steps we take are sure-footed and sustainable.

Before I hand over to Angela to run through the data slides, I want to provide an update on one further feature that coronavirus as a challenge has thrown up for this country, and indeed, for the whole world.

Whilst the vast majority of people, and countries have come together and rallied to this international mission to defeat coronavirus, there will always be some who seek to exploit a crisis for their own criminal and hostile ends.

We know that cyber criminals, and other malicious groups are targeting individuals, businesses, and other organisations by deploying COVID-19 related scams and phishing emails. That includes groups that in the cyber security world are known as ‘advanced persistent threat’ groups – sophisticated networks of hackers who try to breach computer systems. We have clear evidence now that these criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations, which are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, which I have to say makes them particularly venal and dangerous at this time.

We are working with the targets of those attacks, with the potential targets, and with others, to make sure that they are aware of the cyber threat, and that they can take the steps necessary to protect themselves or, at the very least, mitigate the harm that could be brought against them.

With that in mind, today, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have published a joint warning about these groups.

And we’ve offered some advice on the cyber criminals and other actors who are seeking to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic through malicious cyber activity. Our teams have identified campaigns targeting healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, research organisations, and also various different arms of local government.

There are various objectives and motivations that lie behind these attacks, from fraud on the one hand to espionage. But they tend to be designed to steal bulk personal data, intellectual property and wider information that supports those aims, and they are often linked with other state actors.

We expect this kind of predatory criminal behaviour to continue and evolve over the coming weeks and months ahead, and we are taking a range of measures to tackle the threat. So, as we have done today, we will share advice on the nature of those threats to enable business, citizens and our international partners to better defend themselves against the full range of cyber-attack – from hostile states to criminal gangs.

Preventive action is often the very best way to deny attackers the opportunities they are looking for. The  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) offers a range of practical advice to safeguard against cyber-attacks. From things like the use of online passwords, to guidance on trusted sources of online information relating to COVID-19 like the GOV.UK sites or Public Health England.

As well as providing practical advice, the UK will continue to counter those who conduct cyber-attacks. And we’re working very closely with our international partners both to respond to the threats, but also to deter the gangs and the arms of state who lie behind them.

We’re absolutely determined to defeat coronavirus, and also to defeat those trying to exploit the situation for their own nefarious ends.

Good afternoon. I am joined today by the government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance and Dr Yvonne Doyle who is the medical director of Public Health England.

Before I talk about some decisions taken today, and Sir Patrick provides an update on the latest data, I would like to set out the steps we are taking to defeat coronavirus.

Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of the virus so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the NHS’s ability to cope.

At each point we have been following scientific and medical advice and we have been deliberate in our actions - taking the right steps at the right time.

We are also taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the numbers of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment on the front-line to give people the care they need when they need it most.

This is why we are instructing people to stay at home, so we can protect our NHS and save lives.

I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:

A total of 438,991 people in the UK have now been tested for coronavirus, that includes 21,328 tests carried out yesterday.

Of those, 108,692 people have tested positive.

That is an increase of 5,599 cases since yesterday.

18,978 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK.

And sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 14,576 have now died.

That is an increase of 847 fatalities since yesterday.

We must never forget that behind every statistic is a family member or a friend.

And all our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.

These figures are a powerful reminder to us all of the importance of following the government’s guidance.

And as the Foreign Secretary outlined yesterday, the current social distancing measures will remain in place for at least the next 3 weeks.

And there are 5 tests that must be satisfied before we will consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures.

First, we must protect the NHS’s ability to cope. We must be confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.

Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate from coronavirus, so we can be confident that we have moved beyond the peak.

Third, we need to have reliable data from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.

Fourth, we need to be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.

Fifth, and most importantly, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS.

The worst thing we could do now, is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of the virus to hit the NHS and hit the British people.

So I want to thank each and every person across the UK who is following and supporting the government’s advice to stay at home, in order that we protect our NHS and, ultimately, save lives.

I know we are asking you to make sacrifices. And it is challenging. But we need to keep going. Working together, we will defeat this invisible enemy.

Now is not the time to let up. The risk still persists – not only for yourself, but for the people around you. So we must stay vigilant.

But of course, the point we hope to get to, one of the ways we can defeat this virus, is to find a vaccine.

Just as Edward Jenner developed the smallpox vaccine in the eighteenth century, we need to apply the best of British scientific endeavour to the search for the coronavirus vaccine.

To that end I can announce today, that the government has set up a Vaccines Taskforce to co-ordinate the efforts of government, academia and industry towards a single goal:

To accelerate the development of a coronavirus vaccine.

This taskforce is up and running and aims to ensure that a vaccine is made available to the public, as quickly as possible.

The taskforce, reporting to me and the Health Secretary, is led by Sir Patrick and Professor Jonathan van Tam.

It comprises representatives from government, industry, academia and regulators.

Members include Government Life Sciences Champion Sir John Bell, as well as AstraZeneca, and the Wellcome Trust.

The taskforce will support progress across all stages of vaccine development, at pace.

It will back Britain’s most promising research, positioning the UK as a leader in clinical vaccine testing and manufacturing.

The taskforce will co-ordinate with regulators to facilitate trials which are both rapid and well supervised.

And it will work with industry in the UK and internationally, so we are in a position to manufacture vaccines at scale.

This will build on the Prime Minister’s announcement last month of a further £210 million for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the international fund to find a vaccine.

I can confirm that the government has green lighted a further 21 research projects to help fight coronavirus.

In total, these projects will receive £14 million from a £25 million government research investment and include backing the development of a vaccine at Imperial College London.

This follows support for 6 projects, announced last month, including vaccine development led by Professor Sarah Gilbert at the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute. This is already carrying out preclinical trials and, with government support, will shortly move into a clinical trial phase.

And we are looking forward. So when we do make a breakthrough, we are ready to manufacture it by the millions.

One tool in this fight will be the UK’s first Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre based in Harwell.

A project that will help build our capacity to develop and mass produce vaccines here in the UK.

The government will be accelerating the building of this facility.

The Bioindustry Association is also working closely with our taskforce and bringing together a whole range of businesses keen to use their expertise to mass produce vaccines, as soon as one is ready.

I want to pay a heartfelt tribute to all the scientists and researchers, working tirelessly, on these projects.

Yet even with all their efforts, we should be under no illusions.

Producing a vaccine is a colossal undertaking.

A complex process which will take many months.

There are no guarantees.

But the government is backing our scientists, betting big to maximise the chances of success.

I am proud of how, again and again, Britain has stepped up and answered the call to action.

An enormous challenge being tackled through a vast national effort.

Where problem-solvers, from science, business and government join forces to beat this invisible killer.

We cannot put a date on when we will get a vaccine.

But we live in a country with a rich history of pioneering science.

And with the government backing our scientists we have the best chance to do this as quickly as possible.","Department of Health and Social Care, Public Health England, Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP",2020-04-17,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-17-april-2020"

Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.

I am joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, and by Baroness Dido Harding, the Chair of NHS Improvement and of our Test and Trace programme.

Today we formally launch the NHS Test and Trace service. This is an incredibly important milestone for the country that I know people will want to hear about.

Before I do, I’d like to update you on the latest coronavirus data:

3,798,490 tests have now been carried in the UK, including 117,013 tests yesterday
  267,240 people have tested positive, which is an increase of 2,013 cases yesterday
  of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 37,460 people have sadly died
  and since yesterday, 412 deaths have been recorded
We mourn them and we will not forget them.

As I said yesterday, thanks to your effort and sacrifice we are past the peak. We’ve flattened the curve, we’ve protected the NHS.

And the big question that we’re all working to answer is this:

Until an effective treatment or vaccine comes through, how can we get back to doing more of the things that make life worth living without risking safety or putting lives at risk?

NHS Test and Trace is a big part – not the only part – but a big part of the answer to that question.

NHS Test and Trace means we can start to replace the national lockdown with individual isolation for those who’ve been in contact with the virus and local action where it’s necessary to respond to a flare up.

The concept is simple. First, through testing, we hunt down the virus, finding out who is infected right now.

And I use ‘we’ very deliberately. Because we all have our part to play. This is a national effort and we all have a role. If you have symptoms, you must isolate immediately and get yourself a test.

Yesterday, 2,013 people tested positive.

And the next step is that through contact tracing, like detectives, the NHS clinician from NHS Test and Trace and the person who’s tested positive work together to identify the possible movements of the virus, where it’s been and who else it might have infected.

Then we isolate those contacts who might have been infected so the virus is unable to spread. And we break the chain of transmission.

Think of it like this. The virus exists only to reproduce. That is its sole biological purpose: to make as many copies of itself as possible.

If we can thwart that purpose, we can control the virus and ultimately defeat it.

We must all follow the NHS Test and Trace instructions, because this is how we control the virus and protect the NHS and save lives.

Some people have asked why now? Why not launch this programme earlier in the course of the pandemic?

The answer is because we needed to flatten the curve.

Right at the start of this epidemic, we had a contact tracing system in place.

But, as the virus raged towards its peak, the number of infections grew so large that we needed a national lockdown. This was the only way to get it under control.

Effectively, everyone in the country was contacted and told to stay at home.

Now we’ve got the number of new infections each day right down, the number of contacts of those who’ve tested positive is small enough that we can be in touch with everyone we need to.

And, of course, testing capacity is critical to making this work.

We now have the capacity for 161,000 tests a day. And, because of that increased capacity, I can announce that we’re expanding eligibility yet further.

From tomorrow, we are expanding eligibility for testing to include the under-5s so that now every single person who has symptoms of coronavirus can get a test, no matter their age.

And, what’s more, to make NHS Test and Trace as effective as possible, it is very important that everyone with symptoms must isolate immediately and go and get a test.

Now, I want to thank and pay tribute to everyone involved in making this big project happen.

Dido Harding who has led the work, the technicians in the labs making mass-testing a reality, the contact tracers manning the phones, the healthcare staff providing expert advice and the companies who’ve helped us put it together at record scale and pace.

And what really matters is this. To protect your friends and your family, testing and tracing must become a new way of life.

This is being launched today in England.

Northern Ireland already has a system in place and my colleagues in the Scottish and Welsh governments are working to bring in a system as soon as they can. All 4 nations have been working together to make sure we have systems that are co-ordinated across the whole country.

And the instructions to people are clear:

If you get symptoms, isolate immediately and get a test
  If you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace instructing you to isolate, you must
It is your civic duty, so you avoid unknowingly spreading the virus and you help to break the chain of transmission.

This will be voluntary at first, because we trust everyone to do the right thing. But we can quickly make it mandatory if that’s what it takes.

Because, if we don’t collectively make this work, then the only way forward is to keep the lockdown.

Put better, the more people follow the instructions, the safer we will be and the faster we can safely lift the lockdown.

So, do it for the people you love. Do it for your community. Do it for the NHS and do it for all those front line workers, who’ve gone out every day and put themselves at risk to keep you and your family safe.

And in return for following those instructions, you’ll have the knowledge that, when the call came, you did your bit at a time when it really mattered, when the whole country, who are desperate to see their families, were counting on you to do the right thing. You did your bit to bring us all closer together, and closer to that day when we will be reunited.

This system will start tomorrow morning at 9am and the first people who will be contacted will be the people who received a positive result today.

This is a very distinct change on our approach and I just want to take a moment to recap the extent of the change.

Today, we say ‘isolate’ to anyone with coronavirus symptoms and their households. This remains vital.

From 9am tomorrow, in addition, if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace advising you to isolate, then you must do that, whether you have symptoms or not.

Now, I also know that for those without symptoms who receive that call, I fully acknowledge that this is a big ask and you are going to make a sacrifice.

But this is for a purpose. And that purpose is the safety of everyone. Because we know you can have the virus and spread it to other people without ever having symptoms at all.

And it’s not just the safety of all, but the liberty of all that is at stake here.

We are only in a position to re-open primary schools and outdoor markets – if they’re COVID-secure – this coming Monday because we’ve flattened the curve and now we have this system in place.

In the coming weeks, we will gradually and very carefully move away from a lockdown that is national in scope, blanket in application and start moving towards a system that is much more targeted in scope and focuses local action on tackling local flare-ups.

This will help us to restore some of the basic freedoms that matter so much to people, and doing some of the things that people are yearning to do, like seeing friends and family, booking a holiday or getting a haircut, all while controlling the virus and keeping people safe.

It is a brand new service on a scale never seen before. There will be bumps in the road and we will constantly improve it.

And in the weeks ahead we will ramp up the service still further. And once the system’s bedded in we will roll out the NHS Contact Tracing App that is being piloted in the Isle of Wight.

And, of course, NHS Test and Trace is only one part of the answer, it’s not the whole answer.

All of the action we’re taking to get R down and keep R down, it all requires us to keep doing the right thing.

Testing and tracing will help us to hunt down this virus. It is one of the tools with which we can finish the job and we all need to play our part.

So please, stay alert, control the virus and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-05-28,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-27-may-2020"

Good afternoon and welcome again to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing. Today I want to update you on social care, something I know is of huge importance to everybody watching. I’d also like to welcome David Pearson to the press conference in his new role as Chair of our National COVID-19 Social Care Support Taskforce.

Before turning to social care, I’d like to take you through latest coronavirus data.

Slide 1 – testing capacity and new cases

The first slide shows number of new cases confirmed in the UK and also the level of testing. There were 138,183 tests done yesterday, bringing the total to over 5.7 million. As you can see in this chart, the number of confirmed cases was 1,205. And that is the lowest since the end of March and you can clearly see the 7-day rolling average also continuing to fall.

Slide 2 – admissions and ventilators

The data from hospitals also shows a continued fall. The number of admissions with COVID-19 across England, Wales and Northern Ireland has fallen again to 519 – that’s down from 661 a week ago so we can see the continued downward trend in the number of new daily admissions. And the number of people on mechanical ventilators in UK as a whole is also falling and is now 516.

Slide 3 – overall number of people in hospital

Here we can see the number of people in hospital with COVID on a regional basis. I know there’s been a lot of interest in the regional R figure in recent days. The estimate of SAGE, taking into account all of the evidence is that R is below 1 in all regions.

In all areas the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is falling in all regions – faster in some areas than others. It is on that downward trajectory in each individual case and the total number of people in hospital is 6,403, which is down from over 7,500 this time last week.

Slide 4 – mortality

The number of deaths from coronavirus with a positive test yesterday was 55. That recorded figure is the lowest since 21 March. This data does tend to be lower at weekends so we do expect it to rise again in future, but you can see the 7-day rolling average continues to fall. That means the total number of deaths stands at 40,597.

As I’ve said in the House just now, though the number is much lower than it has been, each of these deaths still represents a tragedy for a family and a community so we will continue all of our work to drive that figure down.

I’m glad to report also that the number of deaths recorded in London hospitals yesterday was 0 and likewise in Scotland there were no recorded deaths – that is very good news for the capital and for Scotland.

All of this data is pointing in the right direction and it shows that we are winning the battle with this disease, but they also show there’s further to go.

Care homes

I will now turn to care homes.

The number of people dying in care homes is also falling.

Figures from the CQC show there’s a 79% fall from the peak of the crisis in care homes the week ending April 24 to weekend ending 29 May, the latest when the data is available. The latest ONS data shows there were 12,739 registered deaths in care homes in the year up to 22 May and this represents 29.1% of all registered COVID deaths.

From the earliest days of this crisis, we recognise that people in social care were uniquely vulnerable. Two-thirds of people in social care are over the age of 85 and the latest data from PHE show that the over 80s are 70 times more likely to die from coronavirus than the under 40s.

I know personally what an anxious time it is, and it has been for anyone with a loved one in social care. Right from the start we’ve given guidance and financial support for care homes, we’ve prioritised testing, we’ve strengthened the links between the NHS and social care with a named clinical lead for every care home in England and we’ve asked councils to conduct daily reviews of the situation on the ground.

And the social care COVID-19 support taskforce, which David will be chairing, will oversee delivery of the next phase of our plan for social care, ensuring care homes have the support, training, resources they need to control this virus. Crucially, this involves working with the care system to develop a plan for keeping staff and residents safe in the months after, as the lockdown measures are eased.

David Pearson brings a wealth of experience in public health and in social care, so I am very glad to have him onboard and he’s perfect for the role of driving this forward over the weeks and months ahead.

I also want to say a word about testing.

Last month I announced that all residents and staff of elderly care homes in England would receive a test by early June regardless of whether they had symptoms or not. And I want to thank my team and those colleagues in social care who delivered that target on time on Saturday. We’ve now sent over 1 million test kits to almost 9,000 elderly care homes and the care homes themselves asked they have the flexibility to do the test when it works for them.

And the good news is that the test results so far do not show a significant rise in positive cases, despite going through and testing all of the residents and staff. Throughout the crisis we’ve been rapidly testing any care home with an outbreak, or any resident or staff member with symptoms. And as we built up testing capacity, we prioritised testing of care homes for the elderly, making sure that every resident and staff member could be tested whether or not they had symptoms. And the reason we did this is because the evidence shows that age is by far the greatest risk factor.

We will now make sure we do all of this in working-age care homes as well.

So, I can announce that from today, all remaining adult care homes in England will be able to order the whole care homes testing service for residents and staff. This service will benefit residents and staff in over 6,000 more care homes.

It’ll mean that right across adult social care, everyone will have the certainty and confidence of a high-quality coronavirus test whether symptomatic or not, certainty about whether or not they’re carrying the virus, and confidence that they’re doing the right thing both to protect themselves and others.

Finally, this is carers week and I want to say a heartfelt thanks to each and every carer, whether paid or unpaid, for all the work they’re doing to support family and friends and loved ones, especially in this time of crisis. Your duty and your devotion to a job that you do with love in incredibly challenging circumstances – they’re a huge inspiration as we work through this crisis together.

I understand what a worrying time it is and it’s not just because of the risk of the virus but because you haven’t been able to physically be with your loved ones.

But that day when we can reunite is getting closer. The curve continues to come down, the NHS has been protected, our vaccine work is making progress, we are winning the battle against coronavirus so please stay alert, control the virus and save lives.

I’m now going to ask David to set out the next steps in the social care action plan and the work to control coronavirus within social care and protect residents and staff that he’ll be leading.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-06-09,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-8-june-2020"

Coronavirus press conference 25 April 2020.

Good afternoon, welcome back to Downing Street for the government’s daily press conference on coronavirus.

Today I am joined by Lynne Owens, Director General of the National Crime Agency, and by Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England.

The government’s step-by-step plan has always been to slow the spread of this disease, increasing the capacity of our world-class hospitals so that they can cope.

And your hard work has helped us to do this.

Our instruction remain clear.

People should stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.

Through our ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of 9am today, I can report that:


    six hundred and forty thousand, seven hundred and ninety-two tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including twenty-eight thousand seven hundred and sixty tests yesterday
  
  
    one hundred and forty-eight thousand, three hundred and seventy-seven people have tested positive, that’s an increase of four thousand nine hundred and thirteen cases since yesterday
  
  
    sixteen thousand, four hundred and eleven people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down from seventeen thousand and forty-nine yesterday
  
  
    and sadly, of those in hospital with the virus, twenty thousand three hundred and nineteen have died - that’s an increase of eight hundred and thirteen fatalities since yesterday
  
As the deaths caused by this terrible virus pass another tragic and terrible milestone, the entire nation is grieving.

My deepest sympathies and condolences go to those who have lost loved ones.

And, I would like to pay tribute to the selfless frontline workers who have been struck down by this virus.

Their exceptional public service and sacrifice will not be forgotten.

The last time I was here, I spoke about the impact of this national emergency on crime – and the tough but necessary measures to tackle it.

I announced enhanced support for victims of domestic abuse, many of whom are particularly vulnerable and exposed.

Our You Are Not Alone campaign - to signpost the help available and to make it clear to victims they can still leave home - has made an incredible impact, with 98 million online impressions.

Now, I refuse to ignore the amplified risk for the victims of hidden crime, and I – along with Lynne, and across our law enforcement agencies – refuse to allow criminals to take advantage of these unprecedented times.

Now, provisional data from police shows a fall in overall crime during this coronavirus outbreak.

Car crime, burglary and shoplifting are all lower than in the same period from this time last year.

But we also know that the most sophisticated criminals continue to exploit and capitalise on this horrendous crisis.

So today, I have a message for them: our world-class law enforcement is also adapting, and they are onto you.
And their efforts are paying off.

Last week, Border Force found one million pounds’ worth of cocaine set to be smuggled into the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel, hidden in boxes of face masks.

The NCA (National Crime Agency) has taken down multiple websites running phishing scams and selling bogus PPE.

Last week they arrested 2 people suspected of trying to sell unregistered coronavirus testing kits.

The NCA have alerted the police to thirteen hundred potential child sexual abuse cases.

They have made arrests and safeguarded children.

This is a sickening reminder of the frightening activity that is targeted towards our children every single day.

International action to crush criminal gangs and to shut drug supply lines continues, and the National Crime Agency helped to seize 700 kilograms of heroin in Pakistan, potentially bound for the United Kingdom.

Reported losses for coronavirus fraud now stands at £2.4 million,  and I would like to thank the major banks and UK Finance who are working with us to protect vulnerable people from becoming victims of crime.

And, our outstanding frontline police officers and their staff continue to do an exceptional job in keeping our streets safe.

They are still responding to all types of crime.

That includes some extraordinary dangerous driving, with a minority of drivers using quieter roads as their own personal race track and endangering people’s lives.

We have seen speeds of up to one hundred and fifty one miles per hour clocked on the M1, and one hundred and thirty four miles per hour in a 40 miles per hour zone in London.

Police and fire staff continue to put their arms around people and communities: by taking people shopping and taking prescriptions to the elderly, driving ambulances and supporting those in need throughout this difficult times.

I am immensely grateful to each and every one of our emergency service heroes.

And I would also like to take this particular opportunity to pay tribute to the South Yorkshire Police motorcyclist tragically killed as he responded to an emergency earlier this week.

My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and colleagues at this truly heart-breaking time.

His death shows how our exceptional police put their own lives at risk every day to protect the people that they serve.

Coronavirus merely highlights the extent of their courage, their compassion and their commitment.

Police officers and staff continue to put themselves at risk to ensure that people follow the life-saving instruction to stay at home.

Now, staying at home for almost 5 weeks has changed the way in which we are living our lives, and I know how tough this has been.

Huge sacrifices have been made: jobs have been lost; to people’s futures have been put on hold, weddings have been cancelled, families have been unable to see one another.

Every single person across our United Kingdom has given up a great deal.

From the vulnerable, the elderly, those self-isolating alone, to the hundreds of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses, to the children and young people whose education has been put on hold.

This extraordinary national effort has been quite remarkable and I am grateful to everybody for playing their part.

But we should not lose sight of the fact this country’s efforts are working.

So my thanks go to the British people.

You have fostered a spirit of national unity that is helping us to get through this challenging time.

The action we are collectively taking is working, and your sacrifices are undoubtedly saving lives.

We know that people are frustrated, but we are not out of danger yet.

It is imperative that people continue to follow the rules designed to protect their families, their friends and their loved ones. This will continue to save lives.

We all want to return to living our lives as normally as possible, and, of course, as soon and as safely as we can – and that’s what the entire government is working towards.

But the five tests we have laid out must be met before we can ease these life-saving restrictions.

We must be sure that we can continue to protect the NHS.

That there is a sustained and consistent fall in the daily rates of death.

That the data shows the rate of infection decreases.

That the operational challenges are met.

And of course, that there is no risk of a second peak of infections.

Until then, we all have a role to play in pulling our country out of this crisis.

So, I urge you all to stay strong and embrace that spirit of national unity by continuing to follow the advice: to stay at home, to protect the NHS and save lives.","Home Office and The Rt Hon Priti Patel MP",2020-04-25,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/home-secretary-delivers-daily-coronavirus-update-25-april-2020"
"92","Speech","Housing Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 13 May 2020","The Housing Secretary on the government’s response to COVID-19 and the plan to safely restart, reopen and renew the housing market.","video

Good afternoon,

As Housing Secretary, I’m going to set out our comprehensive plan to safely restart, reopen and renew the housing market.

But first, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.


    2,094,209 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 87,063 tests carried out yesterday
  
  
    229,705 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,242 cases since yesterday
  
  
    11,327 people are in hospital with COVID-19, down 15% from 13,273 last week
  
  
    And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 33,186 have now died. That’s an increase of  494 fatalities since yesterday
  
These figures includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.

Before turning to the housing market I want to remind people of how we will address this phase of our fight against COVID-19.

Firstly, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System, with 5 levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus.

The alert level will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.

And in turn that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place.

The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures.

The social distancing measures remain critical in our efforts to control the virus.

Throughout the period of lockdown which started on 23 March we have been at Level 4 – meaning a COVID-19 epidemic is in general circulation, and transmission is high or rising exponentially.

Thanks to the hard work and the sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down, now that we are in a position to begin moving to Level 3, we will do so in time, in careful steps.

We have set out the first of 3 steps we will take to carefully modify the measures and gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life – but crucially doing so while avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak that could overwhelms the NHS.

After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data will be used, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is completely safe to do so.

The first step – from this week:

Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work.
  You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like.
  You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided you stay 2 metres 
apart.
The second step – from 1 June , at the earliest, as long as the data allows, we will aim to do the following:

Primary schools to reopen for some pupils, in smaller class sizes.
  Non-essential retail to start to reopen, when and where it is safe to do so.
  Cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed doors, without crowds.
And then step 3 – no earlier than 4 July, and again, only if the data says it safe to do so, we aim to allow:

More businesses and premises to open, including potentially those offering personal care such as leisure facilities, public places, and places of worship.
And on that last point, I have been speaking to faith leaders and will convene later this week a taskforce to establish when and how places of worship can openly safely for some of the practices where social distancing can take place, such as private prayer, potentially private prayer being able to be carried out earlier than 4 July.

Many of these businesses and organisations will need to operate in new ways to ensure they are safe, and we will work with those sectors and individuals on how to do this.

Having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated what we are asking people to do, which is to Stay Alert, to Control the Virus and Save Lives.

For many people the appropriate course still means staying at home as much as possible.

But there are a range of other actions we’re advising people to take when they do go out to work or for other activities:


    limiting contact with other people
  
  
    keeping distance if you go out – 2 metres apart where possible
  
  
    washing your hands regularly
  
  
    wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant – for example in some shops or on public transport
  
  
    and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate
  
If everyone stays alert and follows these rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections.

This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.

And as we begin to recover from coronavirus, it’s essential that we cautiously open essential parts of our economy, where it is safe to do so.

Earlier today in Parliament, I made a statement setting out our clear, coherent and comprehensive plan to restart, reopen and renew the housing market and our construction industry.

I’m sure that this will be of interest to many people at home who are hoping to move house, and I’d like to set out what this means in more detail.

From today anyone in England can move house if they follow new guidance we have published on GOV.UK.

When the lockdown was announced in March, we changed the rules so that people could only move home if they thought it was “reasonably necessary”.

That meant that more than 450,000 buyers had to put their plans on hold.

And each month 300,000 tenancies come up for renewal as well.

A significant proportion of these will result in people needing to or wanting to move home. The pressure to move for some was becoming acute, with serious legal, financial and health implications.

During an already very difficult time, these people have been stuck in limbo. Now they can carry on with their house moves and add some certainty to their lives.

So, from today:


    estate agents’ offices can re-open
  
  
    viewings – whether virtual or in person – are permitted
  
  
    show homes can open
  
  
    and removal companies and the other essential parts of the sales and letting process are re-started with 
immediate effect
  
For most people moving home is not a luxury. People decide to move home because their personal circumstances change.

The changes that I have announced today are happening safely in order to control the virus and to protect the public.

We have published very detailed guidance, informed by public health advice, to explain how this can be achieved, with all parties observing hygiene measures and social distancing guidelines.

People have asked why they would be able to look around a stranger’s house, but not visit their parents or loved ones at home.

Now I understand why that might seem confusing at first glance – especially when people have been separated from their loved ones for so long.

But our guidelines makes clear that in the first instance that viewings should happen virtually. When viewings do happen in person, we’ve set out a clear plan to ensure the safety of those already in the property itself, those considering moving in and the estate agents and lettings agents.

These requirements include:


    Visits being by appointment only, open house viewings not taking place, and speculative viewings where buyers or tenants are not serious yet, are highly discouraged.
  
  
    All parties following strict social distancing guidelines.
  
  
    All internal doors should be opened where possible.
  
  
    The current occupier vacating the property for the duration of the visit, going out for their daily exercise, going out to the shops or standing in the garden, if that is possible.
  
  
    All involved in the process washing their hands upon entering the property. And, once the viewing has taken place, all surfaces in the property including the door handles, should be thoroughly cleaned.
  
There are of course exceptions. For those who are self-isolating or have coronavirus, they should not be moving or going back to work or allowing trades people or professionals into their home.

Where this is the case, all parties involved in house buying or selling should prioritise agreeing amicable sensible arrangements to change move dates for the individuals concerned. That has been happening across the country in recent weeks and it will need to continue.

We would also ask those who are clinically vulnerable and those who are shielding to consider very carefully their personal situation and to seek personal and specific medical advice before deciding whether to commit to or proceed with moving home.

If you are in this situation, and you decide that you must go ahead, all professionals involved must be made aware so that they can put in place any additional precautionary measures to provide further protection for your health and further legal protection to make sure the transaction goes as smoothly as can be expected.

A vibrant housing market means more than buying and selling homes. We need to get back to building again and Britain needs that.

It is something that this government has always been committed to. Something that our ambitious First Homes programme will do later this year, with a 30% discount on new homes for key workers including nurses and teachers and police officers as well as local first time buyers.

We want them to be ready as soon as possible and that’s just one of the reasons I am keen to get construction up and running.

To help with this today I am announcing further steps to support safe house building by allowing more flexible working hours on construction sites, where it’s appropriate and with local consent.

I am allowing sites to apply to extend their working hours, again with immediate effect, to 9pm Monday to Saturday in residential areas and beyond that in non-residential areas, and setting out a very clear government position that these applications should be approved by local councils unless there are very compelling reasons why this is not appropriate.

Varied start and finish times will make it easier for sites to observe social distancing, take the pressure off public transport like the tube in London, and keep Britain building.

There are countless examples of the industry behaving responsibly and proactively during this pandemic.

I’d like to thank today Taylor Wimpey, who now have now got construction safely underway on the majority of their sites and have started removing staff from the furlough scheme and getting back to work on full pay.

They are offering a discount of 5% for NHS staff and care workers on new homes – a great way to recognise the contribution that our front line heroes are making to the country.

So thank you to them.

It’s also time that the planning system makes more use of digital technology to operate remotely and efficiently during this pandemic.

I am determined that the planning inspectorate be at the forefront of this work – I welcome the inspectorate now undertaking its first ever virtual hearings.

I am asking them to make all hearings virtual within weeks so that the planning system can resume and be made more permanently more accessible and user-friendly.

This is the most comprehensive restarting of an industry in the first phase of our roadmap with few if any transactions there is no visibility and no precedent with which to accurately judge the state of the housing market, but history tells us that in each economic recovery in modern British economic life the housing market has been key to recovery and revival.

As Housing Secretary, I will do everything I can to support the millions of people employed in the construction and the housing industries, to help their sector bounce back, while always prioritising their safety and wellbeing.

Almost 100 separate organisations have already signed up to the Charter for Safe Working Practice, pledging that they will share the responsibility to ensure that their sites operate safely and in accordance with government advice.

I’d like to thank all of all of those who have signed and encourage the whole industry to join them.

Today we reopen, we restart and renew the housing market and construction industry to protect lives, to save jobs and to begin rebuilding our economy.

Thank you.","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government and The Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP",2020-05-13,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/housing-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-13-may-2020"

Opening remarks

Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.

I’m pleased to be joined today by Dr Jenny Harries

Latest data

Let me start by updating you on the latest information from the government’s COBR data file.

As of today (23 May 2020):

3,348,507 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 116,580 tests yesterday.

257,154 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,959 cases since yesterday.

9,331 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 11% since last week.

And tragically 36,675 people have now died. That’s an increase of 282 fatalities since yesterday and that’s across all settings.

Not just a list of statistics, but a devastating reminder of the cruelty of coronavirus.

Our thoughts are with the friends and families of the victims.

Transport context

As we start to relax the restrictions, we must plan our route to recovery….

Allowing people to resume their lives where possible…

Getting businesses up and running again…

And building beyond coronavirus.

In the short term, we will need to bring back more public transport to keep families safe.

That process has already begun.

Rail and tube services increased at the beginning of this week - and they’ll ramp up more next month.

And to ensure that more buses, trams and light-rail networks return to service today I can announce new investment of £283 million to start moving back to a full timetable.

However, I do want to stress this funding does not mean we can go back to using public transport whenever we like.

Remember…

Those who can should still work from home…

Those who can should still avoid all public transport.

Even a fully restored service will only be capable of carrying – at best – one fifth of normal capacity, once social distancing is taken into account.

So only if you need to travel, and you can’t cycle, or walk or drive, should you take a bus, tram or train.

But please; avoid the rush hour.

Marshals

We’re managing the transport network to make it as safe as possible.

This week saw the deployment of nearly 3,500 British Transport Police, Network Rail and Transport for London employees.

These marshals worked with the public to prevent services from becoming overcrowded.

From 1 June at the earliest – as we move to Phase 2 of the unlock – we will start to deploy twice as many marshals with the assistance of groups like the charity – Volunteering Matters.

These Journey Makers will help provide reassurance, advice and friendly assistance to commuters.

The last time we did this, at the 2012 Olympics, it was a great success.

While these are altogether more serious times – if we show the same public-spirited concern for one another, it will go a long way towards helping transport and passengers cope.

ZipAbout

As I have said, it’s essential we stagger journeys and avoid the rush-hour.

That’s why, at a recent roundtable, we asked the tech sector to come up with innovative proposals to help passengers avoid congestion.

One good example is ‘Passenger Connect’ from Birmingham start-up ZipAbout.

A personalised information service which tells rail users how disruption and crowding may affect their journey, while providing alternatives and helping people to maintain social distancing.

The service has been successfully piloted over the past 12 months and it will be rolled out soon.

Building for the future

We’re not just dealing with the immense challenges of the present.

We’re building for the future too.

Transport is not just about how we get from place to place.

It also shapes the places; for good or bad…

Towns. Cities. Whole nations.

We now have an opportunity to use the power of transport to improve long-standing national weaknesses, and create something better.

Rebalancing the economy

The UKs unbalanced economy is one such weakness.

Our mission is to level-up Britain.

The COVID-19 outbreak must be the catalyst to get it done.

Levelling up. And speeding up.

So, while roads and railways are less busy, we’re accelerating vital projects.

Take the North, for example.

This bank holiday weekend, we’re carrying out vital work to fix Leeds station.

Continuing to build a new platform…

… Installing new points and switches…

… And improving the track to Wakefield.

Just part of 490 separate engineering projects happening around the country this bank holiday weekend.

Work that would normally take months of weekend closures are much quicker on these quieter railways.

Beeching cuts

And we’re getting on with plans to reverse some of the so-called Beeching rail cuts too.

Dr Beeching wrote a report back in the 1960s which led to the closure of one-third of our railway network.

2,363 stations, 5,000 miles of track identified for closure.

Many of the places removed from the map never recovered.

That report was perhaps the origin of the ‘left-behind town’.

But we’re working to reverse Beeching.

The process has already started in Blyth in the North East and Fleetwood in the North West….

I visited in January, and also took the opportunity to visit Horden Peter Lee to see the building work.

There used to be a train station 200 yards away, but it was closed, and the town cut off by the Beeching axe.

This new station will connect a community of over 50,000 people, improving their quality of life.

And today, the next 10 schemes to benefit are announced.

It’s development funding…

… But if they stack up, then we’re going to build them fast.

Amongst the many schemes is the reinstatement of the Ivanhoe line in the East Midlands, from Leicester to Burton, via Coalville and Ashby.

And branch lines on the Isle of Wight, and a new station at Wellington in Somerset.

Roads

But no matter how great we make the railway of the future, millions will still rely on the car.

That’s why today I’m publishing the preferred route to complete the dual carriageway on the A66 from Scotch Corner to Penrith.

The first new all dual-carriageway across the Pennines in 50 years.

This is a £1 billion programme that will transform capacity by upgrading junctions and widening the road.

These road and rail schemes will be the first of many…

Binding our country together, and connecting people with jobs.

Towns and cities

But it isn’t just the balance between regions that we need to reshape.

It’s hard to see millions who - until a few weeks ago - commuted by train into Manchester, London, Birmingham every day - immediately going back to the same old ways.

So we have to reshape our towns and cities too…

The Prime Minister once said:


  Cities are where inspiration and innovation happens … because people can bump into each other, spark off one another, compete, collaborate, invent and innovate. That’s when we get the explosion, or flash of creativity and innovation.


And yet –  with social distancing  –  it makes all that rather more difficult…

So we have to find new ways of making it happen.

Therefore - as conditions allow and not until July – we will be looking to support creative ways for businesses to reopen, whilst maintaining social distancing.

We know restaurants and bars will want to start trading again, and we will work with them so we can enjoy an outdoor summer in a safe and responsible environment.

Car parking

For those who live too far to cycle and walk, and must drive to major conurbations, we will repurpose parking in places just outside town centres…

… so people can park on the outskirts and finish their journeys on foot or bike or even e-scooter.

Our aim with many of these measures is not merely to get through the lifting of restrictions, and then return to how things were…

… But to come out of this recovery stronger, by permanently changing the way we use transport.

Cycling

Take the bike for example, previously we announced the introduction of a scheme to help bring bicycles back to a roadworthy condition…

… relieving the pressure on public transport, and improving the nation’s health.

Today I can provide the detail of the new £50 bicycle maintenance voucher.

Available from next month, the scheme will help up to half-a-million people drag bikes out of retirement.…

… Speeding up the cycling revolution…

… Helping individuals become fitter and healthier…

… And reducing air pollution, which remains a hidden killer.

Clean air should be as big a priority for us in the 21st century as clean water was to the Victorians in the 19th.

Closing remarks

The measures discussed today will help…

… more passengers use trains, buses and trams safely….

… More commuters to take up active travel….

… And more people to benefit from infrastructure improvements in the Northern Powerhouse, and across the country.

They give us all an opportunity to harness the power of transport…

Not just to help us return to the lives in the post-COVID-19 world…

… But to make our economy more resilient.

Our population healthier.

And to change our nation for the better.

Good afternoon and welcome to the Downing Street coronavirus daily briefing. I’m joined by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Professor Van Tam, and by Professor John Newton.

At the heart of our plan is ensuring that NHS capacity is always ahead of need. This means that if you or someone you love needs hospital care with COVID-19 then you will get that care.

And if, God forbid, you needed to go into an intensive care unit, then you will have the bed and the life-saving equipment and team you need.

The latest figures show another record high of 2,963 spare critical care beds available across the NHS.

We said at the start of this that our primary goal in our battle plan was to slow the spread and protect the NHS, by flattening the curve and by increasing capacity.

That plan is working.

At no point in this crisis has anyone who could benefit from critical care been denied that care because there weren’t enough staff or beds or ventilators to treat them.

But there is much further to go.

On the most recent figures, 535,342 tests have now been carried out in the UK, excluding Northern Ireland. Of these, 129,044 people have tested positive. The number of patients in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms is now down to 17,681. 17,366 people have now, sadly, died in hospital, which is an increase of 852. This number is another salutary lesson and it tells us of the deadly nature of this virus.

We owe it to them – and to ourselves – not to throw away the progress we’ve made so far.

We have been clear that we will not risk lives by relaxing the social distancing rules before our 5 tests have been met:

first, that the NHS can continue to cope
  second, that the operational challenges have been met
  third, that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently
  fourth, that the rate of infection is decreasing
  and, most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peak
I want to update you on 2 specific areas of huge importance.

First, PPE.

PPE delivery is an operation of unprecedented scale and complexity.

Since the start of this crisis, we have now delivered over a billion items of PPE.

We are constantly working to improve that delivery system, buying PPE from around the world, and working to make more at home.

We have a diverse range of suppliers and are working day and night to expand that supply base.

We are in direct talks with the factories that produce PPE and the fabric that it’s made of. This has proved one of the most fruitful avenues and I want to especially thank my Foreign Office and DIT colleagues, especially in China, for their incredible work making these connections.

I also want to thank the enormous response we’ve had from our appeal for companies to come forward to help replenish the stocks.

As of yesterday, we have had 8,331 offers of PPE equipment and we are investigating each and every one of those many leads.

Of course, some of these leads have led to very large-scale purchases of many millions of items. But, the reality is that not everyone who approaches us can deliver on their offers in scale.

I’m very grateful to all those who have come forward.

We are actively engaged with over 1,000 companies, and I can announce that we are working with 159 potential UK manufacturers, which are starting to come on stream.

I have said many times how determined I am to get people the PPE they need. This is a 24/7 operation. It’s one of the biggest cross-government operations I’ve ever seen.

I’m grateful to colleagues from the NHS, from Public Health England, the Crown Commercial Service, Cabinet Office, the Communities Department, the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces, the devolved administrations and territorial offices, the Business Department, the Treasury, the Foreign Office and the Department for International Trade for their enormous hard work on this.

And I’m very grateful to Lord Deighton, who delivered the Olympics, for stepping forward to lead this national effort, and deliver once again for his country.

The second area is vaccines.

In the long run, the best way to defeat coronavirus is through a vaccine. After all, this is a new disease, this is uncertain science, but I am certain that we will throw everything we’ve got at developing a vaccine.

The UK is at the forefront of the global effort. We have put more money than any other country into the global search.

For all the efforts around the world, 2 of the leading vaccine developments are taking place here at home at Oxford and Imperial. Both these promising projects are making rapid progress, and I’ve told the scientists leading them that we will do everything in our power to support.

First, I am today making £22.5 million available to the Imperial team project to support their phase 2 clinical trials, which will assess a sample of several thousand, and for them to begin the work on a subsequently very large-scale phase 3 trial.

Second, I am today making available £20 million to the Oxford team to fund their clinical trials.

The team have accelerated the trials process, working with the regulator the MHRA, who have been absolutely brilliant, and as a result I can announce that the vaccine from the Oxford trial will be trialled in people from this Thursday.

In normal times, reaching this stage would take years and I’m very proud of the work taken so far.

At the same time, we will invest in manufacturing capability so that, if either of these vaccines safely work, then we can make it available for the British people as soon as humanly possible.

Nothing about this process is certain.

Vaccine development is a process of trial and error and trial again. That’s the nature of how vaccines are developed.

But I’ve told Sarah Gilbert and Robin Shattock, 2 of our most inspiring scientists, that we are going to back them to the hilt and give them every resource they need to get the best possible chance of success, as soon as possible.

After all, the upside benefit of being the first country to develop a successful vaccine is so huge that I am throwing everything at it.

Coronavirus is a powerful enemy, but I believe the power of human ingenuity is stronger. Every day the science gets better and we gather more information, we understand more about how to defeat this virus.

But, in the meantime, the most important thing everyone watching this can do is to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-04-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-21-april-2020"
"95","Speech","Business Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 1 April 2020","Business Secretary Alok Sharma gave the 1 April 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Coronavirus press conference 1 April

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for the daily briefing on our fight against coronavirus.

I am joined today by Dr Yvonne Doyle who is the medical director of Public Health England.

Before Yvonne provides an update on the latest data from our COBR coronavirus fact file, I would like to update you on the steps that we are taking to defeat this pandemic.

Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the ability of the NHS to cope.

Throughout our response to coronavirus, we have been following the scientific and medical advice. We have been deliberate in our actions, taking the right steps at the right time.

We are also taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the number of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment on the front-line to provide the care when people need it most.

The daily figures show that a total of 152,979 people in the UK have now been tested for coronavirus.

Of those, 29,474 have tested positive.

The number of people admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus symptoms is now 10,767, with 3,915 of those in London and 1,918 in the Midlands.

Of those hospitalised in the UK, sadly 2,352 have died. This is an increase of 563 fatalities since yesterday. 
The youngest of them was just 13 years old.

All our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.

This is more tragic evidence that this virus does not discriminate.

The coronavirus pandemic is the biggest threat our country has faced in decades, and we are not alone. All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer.

We recognise the extreme disruption the necessary actions we are asking people to take are having on their lives, businesses, jobs and the nation’s economy.

And I want to thank everyone across our whole country for the huge effort that is being made, collectively, in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.

To the frontline workers treating and caring for patients, the people delivering supplies to their neighbours, and the millions staying at home: thank you. You are protecting the NHS and saving lives.

And I want to thank businesses too.

Through your support for your workers and your communities, and through your willingness to support our health service, you are making a real difference.

Whether it’s INEOS building a new hand sanitiser plant near Middlesbrough in just ten days;

Or UCL engineers working with Mercedes Formula One to build new Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machines, which help patients to breathe more easily;

Or broadband providers giving their customers unlimited data to stay connected;

Or indeed London’s ExCel Centre being converted into the NHS Nightingale Hospital with space for 4,000 patients.

These are just a few of the examples of businesses from across our great nation supporting lifesaving work.

There are also thousands of businesses, large and small, which have worked with staff to ensure they are supported in the days and weeks ahead.

Whether that is through ensuring PHE guidelines are followed on site, implementing furlough schemes, carrying over annual leave, or providing the means to work from home.

I want to convey my heartfelt thanks to all of those businesses, up and down the country, which are working to keep our economy going.

So that when this crisis passes, and it will, we are ready to bounce back.

Our businesses are doing all they can to support our people, and I want to make it clear that government, in turn, will do all it can to support our businesses.

We have taken unprecedented action to support firms, safeguard jobs and protect the economy.

From today businesses will start benefiting from £22 billion in the form of business rates relief. And grants of up to £25,000 which are being paid into the bank accounts of the smallest high street firms.

On Saturday, I said that we had provided funds to councils in England for grants to small businesses.

As of today, these local authorities have received more than £12 billion.

This afternoon I held a call with hundreds of local authorities across England and made clear that this money must reach businesses as quickly as possible. And I know that businesses across England have already started to receive these grants.

We know high street banks are working really hard to support the UK through this period, including through mortgage holidays and increased credit facilities.

Loans for businesses are also being issued through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme since it came into operation last week.

The Chancellor, together with the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority, wrote to the chief executives of the UK banks to urge them to make sure that the benefits of the Loan Scheme are passed through to businesses and consumers.

And it would be completely unacceptable if any banks were unfairly refusing funds to good businesses in financial difficulty.

Just as the taxpayer stepped in to help the banks back in 2008, we will work with the banks to do everything they can to repay that favour and support the businesses and people of the United Kingdom in their time of need.

Of course, this is a brand new scheme and, as with all new schemes, it will not be perfect from the outset.

We are listening all the time. And in response to concerns that we’ve heard from businesses, we are looking at ways in which we can ensure they get the support they need. The Chancellor will be saying more on this in the coming days.

It is crucial that when we overcome this crisis, as in time we will, that businesses are in a good position to move forward.

Times are tough, and we have harder times ahead of us.

But I know that together, we will pull through.","Department of Health and Social Care, HM Treasury, Public Health England, Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP",2020-04-01,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-1-april-2020"
"96","Speech","“Events, Dear Boy”:  managing incidents before they become crises","Speech by Sir James Bevan, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, to the Whitehall and Industry Group, 7 July 2020","Introduction

You will probably recognise the quote. When Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was asked what was the greatest challenge for a statesman, he replied: ‘Events, dear boy, events’. The same is true for most leaders and organisations.

Events Happen. When they do a lot of things are at stake: lives, livelihoods, reputation.  So knowing how to respond is a key survival skill for leaders and organisations of all kinds.  In my own career I have learnt many of my most important lessons – including how to manage incidents - the hard way: by making mistakes.  As President Kennedy liked to say: “Good judgement is usually the result of experience. And experience is frequently the result of bad judgement”.

I hope you will find the lessons I have learnt useful in your own world. And whatever world that is, whether it’s government, business, the NGO sector or something else, and whatever your own organisation does, I submit that knowing how to manage incidents is something that will come in handy. That’s because, to quote a third and slightly less successful political figure, Leon Trotsky,  you may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.  Incidents, like events, have a habit of happening whether you like it or not.

So my aim today is to give you News You Can Use.  I will outline how the Environment Agency handles incidents; give you my Top Tips for good incident management; and tell you how we in the EA are managing the unique challenges of Coronavirus.

The EA’s role in incidents

The Environment Agency is a Category One emergency responder under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.  We work with the emergency services, the local authorities and other partners to plan for, respond to and aid recovery from emergencies affecting people and the environment across the country.  Often we are the sole or lead responder, but on many occasions we are part of a coalition working with our professional partners in the 38 Local Resilience Forums across England.

We handle a wide variety of incidents. They include:


    Pollution - fires, oil spills, radiation, nuclear, waste dumping, odours,  noise, pollution of water courses. Examples: the Buncefield explosion at an oil storage facility in 2005, the serious pollution of the Thames by Thames Water in 2013 and 2014 for which they were eventually fined £20m, the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, the Salisbury Novichok attack in 2018.
  
  
    Wildlife – threats to animals and habitat. Examples: Foot & Mouth Disease 2001, drought in 2018.
  
  
    Water – too little and too much. Examples: managing the risk of environmental damage from drought, which we did in summer 2018 and are doing again right now; the risk to people from the Toddbrook Dam damaged in the 2019 downpours; and protecting and supporting communities affected by the February 2020 floods.
  
We handle a lot of incidents. Last year 76,777 were reported to us, which is one every 7 minutes. And we deploy our people to many of those: on average, an incident requires our attendance once every 40 minutes and about 5 incidents every week require significant deployment of our resources.

Our response depends on the incident. But we will always focus on the protection of lives, livelihoods and the environment. In big incidents we deploy a lot of people and a lot of hardware, including Incident Control Vehicles, pumps, temporary flood defences and drones.

Because we do a lot of incident response we are set up as an organisation to do that. We have daily reporting of significant events, so that all the key players can see what is happening and how we are responding. We have standard incident management procedures, with agreed command and control, so everyone knows who is responsible for what. We have over 6,000 of our staff trained and ready to join the response on whom we can draw. We have dedicated facilities at national and local level that we use to manage each incident. We have pre-agreed plans for how we will respond to particular types of incident. We practice, including with the military. And we measure how well we are doing: our capacity to respond well to incidents is one of our Key Performance Indicators.

Since I became Chief Executive in 2015 we have put a lot more emphasis on incident response, and more resources into it. We now respond to more incidents, more quickly and in greater numbers than ever before, and we have made incident response a core part of our business as usual. That is not accidental. Handling incidents well can save lives and livelihoods. Handling them badly can get people killed and ruin your organisation’s reputation.

Top Tips for Incident Management

As I said, much of what I have learnt about incident management during my career has come as much from making mistakes as it has from getting it right. So I offer the following

Top Tips with a large degree of humility

Lead:
if you are your organisation’s leader, you need to lead the response to a big incident. Don’t try and do the day job as well. The incident is the day job till it’s over. This is the moment when your organisation’s reputation will be won or lost, possibly for ever. So it’s worth your time. Be decisive: be prepared to take big decisions. In an incident the biggest risk is not taking a decision that later proves to be wrong (some always will): the biggest risk is not taking a decision at all, or taking it too late. You will not have all the facts: decide anyway.

Move fast:
Flick the switch early to put your organisation into incident mode. If you don’t get ahead of the curve you will never catch up. So over-resource at the start: people, kit, whatever. You can always scale back later. Establish your battle rhythm immediately – which meetings when with whom to do what - and clear roles and responsibilities.

Get on the ground:
The absent are always wrong. Being present and visible at the scene of an incident is as important as what you do when you get there. So get yourself and your team to the scene as soon as possible.

Have a strategy:
Be clear what your goals are and ensure everyone in your team knows. Be ready to adjust your strategy as the situation changes, because it will.

Win the air war:
The media battle (the air war) is as much a part of the incident as your operational response (the ground war).  You need to win both. So use the media: don’t shy away from it. Have a simple message and keep on saying it.  Get the tone right: calm, authoritative, empathetic, commitment to do what’s needed. Accept the inevitability of critical reporting: it’s not personal. It will go away.

Manage upwards:
We all have bosses. Tell them what you are doing and listen to what they want.

Stay well:
Look after your staff’s wellbeing and your own. Ensure everyone is fed and watered and gets a break, including you. Tired people make bad decisions.

Be ready beforehand:
Have an incident plan and practice beforehand. No plan will survive contact with reality, but it’s better than not having one. Time spent in preparation is never wasted: what you do in peacetime is reflected in how you perform during the incident.

Learn the lessons afterwards:
It will never be perfect. But each time you do something right or wrong, you will learn valuable lessons for next time. Do a wash up afterwards, write down the main lessons and keep them handy. You will need them again.

I can sum all this up in six words we use in the EA to guide our incident response: Think Big, Act Early, Be Visible.

Coronavirus: a test case happening now

Lastly, a word about how the Environment Agency is managing one of the biggest incidents ever in peacetime: the Coronavirus epidemic.

We are running our response to this as an incident, using the tried and tested incident machinery I have described.

We set ourselves three clear strategic goals at the start. They are to sustain our critical operations which protect lives and livelihoods; to protect the health, safety and well-being of all our staff and the public; and to remain agile, adjusting our response as necessary in the light of developments.

There are three main challenges with Coronavirus, which I expect all of you are encountering in your own organisations.

The first is strategic: managing in ambiguous circumstances. There is still a lot we don’t know: about the virus, about how long social distancing will be necessary, about the longer term government response, about how the economy will cope, and how the businesses and partners we work with will react. Which is why we need to stay agile.

The second challenge is operational. Most of the EA’s work didn’t stop during the three months of lockdown. But how we did much of that work did change, as we moved most of our staff into working from home. Getting our people back to the workplace – both to the outside workplaces we operate in and our offices - has proven to be a lot harder than withdrawing them. For good reason: we need to do it right, including ensuring that all the necessary social distancing and hygiene measures are in place. That is why we are moving with deliberate pace.

And the third challenge is the humans: maintaining staff well-being, purpose and morale. Most Environment Agency people are pretty resilient. But they are also very committed to doing their jobs and most are keen to get back to the workplace, which for many may still be some months away. Many have caring responsibilities. Some have welfare needs which cannot be met at home. So as lockdown goes on it’s got harder for everyone. Our strategy for managing that is maximum empathy (our key message to staff is to Be Kind – to themselves as much as others), relentless over-communication, and practical steps to improve the experience of all staff, whether they are working from home or back in the workplace.

Conclusion

I started with three quotes from the world of politics. Let me finish with one from the world of sport – American football in fact. This is from Bear Bryant, often considered the greatest college football coach of all time: “In a crisis, don’t hide behind anything or anybody. They’re going to find you anyway.”","Environment Agency and Sir James Bevan",2020-07-07,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/events-dear-boy-managing-incidents-before-they-become-crises"
"97","Speech","The sustainable recovery, investor collaboration on COVID-19 recovery and the climate emergency","Keynote address by Alok Sharma, Business Secretary and COP26 President, at a London Stock Exchange webinar.","Good afternoon everyone and thank you to the London Stock Exchange for organising this event.

Many people across the world are looking to governments during this global emergency to provide leadership and clarity to overcome the unprecedented challenges that we are facing.

Countries across the globe have taken the extraordinary measures to shut down large swathes of their economies in order to combat the coronavirus public health emergency.

In the UK, we did this on 23 March (2020) and we also launched a series of major policy initiatives to support businesses and individuals through the pandemic. Our aim has been to protect businesses, workers and consumers through these measures.

And while we will sadly not be able to save every business and every job, we hope that our measures have provided some certainty and consistency of support.

So as we emerge from the public health pandemic, we not only want to support businesses to bounce back as quickly as possible, but also to do so in a way that meets the UK’s big, structural challenges.

This is why we want to deliver a green recovery. And we want to do that in partnership with business and finance.

I am here today, as the Business Secretary in the UK government, and as President for COP26, to underline the role you, the business community, can play in that joint endeavour.

Because finance and investment are the lifeblood of net zero projects – and we can only meet this challenge together.

I know the role finance can play in delivering this change, having worked in corporate finance myself for over 15 years before I came into politics.

I know the drive to deliver a return on investment and the search for growth areas in the economy.

When I worked in the banking sector, certainly at the start of it, green finance was a nascent initiative.

But things have changed and they do change.

So much so that today we have a former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, whose warning that if some companies fail to adjust to a net zero world, they will fail to exist.

The risks are clear, but actually the opportunities are clearer yet.

And actually it is worth pointing out that since 1990, the UK economy has grown by 75% but at the same time we have cut emissions by 43%.

In the UK we have shown that green growth is possible.

The International Energy Agency has estimated that $13.5 trillion of public and private investment in the global energy sector alone will be required between 2015 and 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement targets.

And the International Renewable Energy Agency recently found that renewable energy would bring returns of between 3-8 dollars on every dollar invested.

BlackRock found that in the first quarter of 2020, during the pandemic, 94% of a set of sustainable funds outperformed their non-sustainable counterparts.

So my message is simple, and I say this as a former financier to the current cohort: the UK is the place for you to invest in green assets.

And you will be welcomed and right to do so.

My department, the business department, is leading work to support a green recovery.

Helping our world-leading offshore wind industry reach 40GW by 2030.

Building the first fully-deployed carbon capture storage cluster by the mid-2020s.

Supporting energy intensive industries as they move to low-carbon techniques.

Helping to improve the energy-efficiency of homes, schools and hospitals.

And delivering 2 million new high-quality jobs in clean growth over the next decade.

Today, nearly half a million people across our country are employed in the low carbon economy and its supply chains.

And recovering from this pandemic makes these projects more necessary and more important than ever. And many of them require private finance to deliver.

Which is why I am currently engaging with businesses across the country on the opportunities that arise from our net zero commitment and how they can support a green recovery.

And we will continue to do so, so I invite all of you to contribute to our thinking by submitting written responses to the questions that we have set out on GOV.UK, and if you’d like to know how to do it then please get in touch with us.

But of course this is alongside our Green Finance Strategy, which aims to accelerate investment in green infrastructure.

And my department will continue to work at pace to deliver these policy commitments over the course of this Parliament.

And now, as we look forward to COP26 next November (2021), our aim is to ramp up ambition towards a climate-resilient, zero-carbon economy.

We want all countries to submit more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions, committing to further cuts in carbon emissions by 2030.

With all nations committing to reaching net zero emissions as soon as possible.

And ahead of COP26, we have defined 5 areas which need particular attention:

clean energy
  clean transport
  nature based solutions
  adaptation and resilience
  and, of course, making all of this possible, finance
Whenever I mention the 5 campaigns, I always make a point of mentioning finance last.

Because, from preserving ecosystems, to manufacturing electric cars and solar panels, it all needs to be paid for.

Again and again, I have seen first-hand how finance turns good ideas into action.

In January this year, I helped launch East Africa’s first ‘green bond’ on the Nairobi securities exchange, followed by its dual listing on the London Stock Exchange. Helping to fund environmentally friendly housing in Nairobi.

And, through the Powering Past Coal Alliance, the UK has worked with Climate Action 100+, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, UN Principles for Responsible Investment and Ceres, all of whom are here today, to help align coal finance and investments with the aims of the Paris Agreement.

So your contribution will be absolutely central to a successful COP26 summit next year.

And ahead of COP, we want to see investors take crucial actions, such as setting a target for net zero and publishing a clear transition plan on how to achieve this.

And this will be underpinned by scenario analyses and of course, methodology reviews.

And while we have seen progress on the Task-Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, this must accelerate.

And I urge you all to continue signing up to the recommendations of the TCFD to build a greener and more resilient financial system.

In February, I joined Mark Carney to launch the COP26 Finance Action Plan to help private finance support the global economy transition to net zero.

Last year at the UN, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a doubling of the UK’s international climate finance commitment to £11.6 billion over 2021 to 2025.

This, in turn, will mobilise further finance from public and private sources. Helping us meet and indeed move beyond the 100-billion-dollar goal, as we begin discussions in the UNFCCC on the goal that will replace it from 2025.

Since 2011, the UK’s international climate finance has already supported over 100 countries and helped to reduce or avoid a total of 16 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, which is equivalent of taking 3.3 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year.

Our UK Pact programme has been part of this.

Since last year, it has helped financial institutions around the world drive down emissions.

Projects in Mexico and China, for example, helped harmonise national definitions of green bonds with global ones. Giving global investors the confidence to invest.

And I can announce today that, from August we will be launching the first round of our UK PACT Green Recovery Challenge Fund.

This is a £12 million challenge fund, that British and international organisations can bid into, to support countries in Africa, Asia and South America to develop their green industries. This will major on green finance and ways that companies can increase transparency and the disclosure of financial risks.

The UK government will fund the best projects and approaches to be deployed globally, and share UK expertise to support others with their own green recovery.

So in conclusion I hope you take away from today the clear message that you and your organisations are absolutely vital in supporting the green recovery and transition to net zero.

Not only because it’s the right policy, but because it is the right business and investment decision.

Because government will stand behind you every step of the way when you make these decisions.

So we can build a better world, through our economic recovery together.

Thank you.","Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP",2020-06-17,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-sustainable-recovery-investor-collaboration-on-covid-19-recovery-and-the-climate-emergency"

For months now, our lives have been on hold.

When the call came in March, we pressed pause on many of the things that brighten our lives.

Meals with friends.

Trips to the cinema or theatre.

We had to close our gyms and swimming pools.

Cancel our holidays.

And postpone some of our favourite events.

But as we’ve made huge progress against this disease, we’ve gradually seen the things we love return.

Today, I’m very pleased to announce we can go a little bit further. As of this weekend, our artists, musicians and dancers can start performing live outside to audiences. We’ll also have the resumption of recreational sport, followed later by the reopening of our gyms, swimming pools and leisure centres.

Normal life is slowly returning.

This is an important milestone for our performing artists, who have been waiting patiently in the wings since March. Of course we won’t see crowds flooding into their venues. But from 11 July, our theatres, operas, dance and music shows can start putting on outdoor performances to socially distanced audiences.

That means theatregoers can experience a live play for the first time in months at places like the stunning Minack Theatre in Cornwall. And music lovers can attend Glyndebourne this summer.

We are taking various measures to make these places safe as they reopen. Venue capacity will be reduced, and organisations encouraged to move to electronic ticketing, to help test and trace.

But our performing artists deserve an audience. And now they will be getting one.

And while those outdoor performances get underway, we will be working with the public health experts to carefully pilot a number of indoor performances - from the London Symphony Orchestra at St Luke’s, to Butlins - to work out how we can confidently usher socially-distanced audiences indoors as soon as possible.

At the same time, we’re funding scientific studies to help us understand and mitigate some specific public health risks, like the impact of singing, wind and brass instruments on transmission.

The more we know about coronavirus in every setting, the safer we will be.

We’re also taking steps through the planning system to protect theatres and venues from demolition or change of use, and of course all of this comms on top of the unprecedented £1.57 billion package of emergency support to help arts, heritage and cultural institutions weather the COVID storm.

But, of course, we want to see all of our venues open as soon as it’s safe to do so.

Today’s announcement brings us a further step closer towards that reality.

Having allowed hairdressers to reopen, beauticians, tattooists, spas, tanning salons and other close-contact services can now do the same I’m pleased to say from Monday. Of course that will be subject to some restrictions on particularly high risk services.

As I’ve seen myself at the Royal Academy this morning, the National Gallery, and as we’ll see shortly from National Museums Liverpool, our cultural institutions are  beginning also to welcome back visitors.

As these places begin to reopen their doors, I’m really urging people to get out there and to play their part. Buy the tickets for outdoor plays and music recitals, get to your local gallery and support your  local businesses.

We have seen in recent weeks how our landlords, waiters and shop assistants have welcomed customers back with open arms, while doing so much to keep their communities safe. It’s time to give other businesses those same opportunities.

The Chancellor this week set out a bumper package of tourism and hospitality tax breaks, to get these industries firing on all cylinders once more and protect the millions of people who work for them.

That means a VAT cut on everything from tickets to shows, theatres, amusement parks, museums and zoos.

Lower costs for hotels, inns, caravan and campsites.

Vouchers for food and non-alcoholic drinks.

I’m urging the British people to make the most of this summer safely. We need them to support the places that we all love.

And today there is good news for our nation’s fitness.

As we all know, exercise is incredibly important for both physical and mental health. Even at the height of lockdown it was considered an essential activity - with countless people hitting their parks for their daily run or transforming their living rooms into temporary gyms.

From this weekend onwards, millions of people will be able to rejoin their local sports teams as soon as their organisations publish approved guidance. Recreational cricket is back on this weekend. Five-a-side football, basketball, hockey and countless other sports will follow shortly after.

From this Saturday, they’ll also be able to enjoy outdoor pools and waterparks.

And from Saturday 25th, people will no longer have to work out in the park or on their living room floor. They’ll be able to get back into their gyms, their indoor swimming pools, their leisure centres, and jump on the spin bike or treadmill for the first time in months.

Now we’ve made a number of positive visits to gyms in recent weeks, and of course had hoped to do this sooner. But we really do have to phase this properly. We will be giving gyms the certainty, clarity and time they need to reopen safely, so that the maximum number can open their doors in just two weeks’ time.

Again, we’ve worked intensively with both professional bodies and the experts to get us to this point, and facilities will have to take a number of measures to protect their communities. That includes for example using timed booking systems to limit the number of people using the facility at any one time, and reduced class sizes. Equipment will be spaced out, and there will be enhanced cleaning throughout.

As always, the public will need to do their bit and follow the guidance sensibly and safely. All of the measures we are taking are conditional and reversible. And we will not hesitate to impose lockdowns where there are local spikes - as we saw in Leicester, where things remain closed and of course in any other place when that is necessary.

But the return of gyms and recreational sport is a vital part of our battle against coronavirus.

We need to get the nation to get match-fit to defeat this disease.

And our fight began with a collective effort, and I really hope it will end with one. At the beginning, we all stayed home to protect the NHS and save lives.

Now the British public has a new part to play.

It’s time to eat out to help out.

Good afternoon and welcome to today’s coronavirus briefing. I am here with Sarah Albon, Chief Executive of the Health and Safety Executive.

Today I want to update you on our continuing work to re-open our country’s economy.

And I know this matters greatly to everyone.

Before I do so, I want to take you through the latest daily coronavirus data slides.

The first slide shows cases confirmed with a test. 5,870,506 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK.  This includes 102,930 tests carried out or posted out yesterday. 289,140 people have tested positive, an increase of 1,387 cases since yesterday. The graph shows a steadily falling number of identified cases on a 7-day rolling average, despite the increase in testing.

The second slide shows the latest data from hospitals. 446 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 6 June, down from 624 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,431 on 1 April. 513 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 653 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.

The third slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country. There are now 6,348 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 17% from 7,622 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,698 on 12 April. As the graphs show, while there is some variation, most nations and regions of the UK are broadly following a similar pattern.

The fourth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus. Across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 40,883. That’s an increase of 286 fatalities since yesterday. When measured by a 7-day rolling average, the daily number of deaths currently stands at 216, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.

The fifth slide shows the deaths where coronavirus was confirmed or suspected reported by the Office for National Statistics. These figures take slightly longer to compile than the daily figures as they are drawn from death certificates. They include not just deaths confirmed with a positive test for COVID-19, but also those confirmed by a doctor without a test, and those where COVID-19 was suspected but not confirmed.

The first chart shows that up to 29 May, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported a total of 50,107 deaths in the UK where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. This compares to the figure of 38,593 deaths confirmed with a positive test previously reported by the Department of Health and Social Care over the same period.

The second chart shows deaths by place of occurrence. Since the start of the outbreak, 62% of registered COVID-19 deaths have occurred in hospitals and 31% have occurred in care homes.

At the start of this crisis, we took the necessary step of closing vast numbers of shops – all but those we regarded as essential - to try and stop the spread of coronavirus and protect the public.

That was the right decision, even though there is no escaping the hardships it will have caused for businesses and their staff.

To support those workers, and businesses, we put in place an unprecedented package of support including, small business grants, loans, the job retention scheme, and the self-employed scheme.

Now, thanks to the efforts of the British public in following social distancing rules, we have succeeded in reducing the number of infections and getting the R rate under control.

That is why we can carefully begin to open parts of the economy which were required to be closed, in a phased and careful manner.

On 1 June we allowed car showrooms and outdoor markets to open.

Thanks to the on-going enormous efforts of people across the country, we continue to meet the Five Tests set out in the Prime Minister’s roadmap.

And the R-rate continues to stay below 1.

So I can confirm today that retail outlets which have been required to be closed, will be able to open their doors again from Monday 15 June so long as they comply with the COVID-secure guidelines we published on 25 May.

This is the latest step in the careful restarting of our economy and will enable high streets up and down the country to spring back to life.

Of course, many shops have remained open throughout the pandemic ensuring that we are able to buy the essentials we need.

And I would like to thank those workers at supermarkets, pharmacies, post offices and other essential retailers for their dedication during this period.

Many of these businesses rapidly adapted to introduce social distancing early on.

Including special opening hours for vulnerable people, perspex screens at checkouts, floor markings to guide shoppers and limiting the number of customers allowed inside a store at one time.

In the new normal, we have all got used to shopping with social distancing.

Now is the right time to apply these principles more widely, to more shops, as we continue our cautious re-opening of the economy.

To support this, on 25 May, my department published updated COVID-secure Safer Working guidance for people who work in or run shops or branches in the retail sector.

This has given retail businesses enough time to make sure their premises are COVID-secure, and this will allow workers to return safely back to stores, and welcome back shoppers on Monday.

This guidance was developed in close consultation with both national and independent retailers, business representative groups, trades unions, Public Health England and the Health and Safety Executive.

Shops should re-open once they are able to follow the COVID-secure guidelines, giving confidence to both their staff and customers that they are opening safely.

This means any business that is open must complete a COVID-19 specific risk assessment and take the necessary steps to manage those risks, as is their legal obligation.

As part of the guidance, we have provided a notice that businesses should visibly display in their shop window or outside their door to show their customers they have read and taken steps to follow the guidance.

If a shop reopens without putting in place responsible steps to reduce the transmission of the virus, we can take a range of actions, including issuing enforcement notices. Local authorities and the Health and Safety Executive regularly carry out checks and respond to concerns from the public regarding risks in the workplace.

But of course, there are businesses which still remain closed.

As soon as we can, we will publish further safer working guidance for restaurants, pubs and bars, as well as hairdressers, barbers, nail bars and related services.

These documents will provide practical steps to allow those businesses to re-open in a manner that is as safe as possible for workers and their customers.

I know there has been a lot of speculation about when we might be able to reopen these parts of the economy and I completely understand why we are all so keen to get them back up and running – I absolutely share your enthusiasm.

But we continue to follow the roadmap, which sets out our ambition to reopen these sectors from 4 July at the earliest.

In the meantime, we will continue to protect livelihoods and support businesses, so that they are ready to bounce back, and play their part, in the economic recovery.

And as we consider measures needed to support our economic bounce-back we will be redoubling our efforts to listen to and work with the business community.

We want to build an economy which is fairer, greener, more dynamic, more innovative and which attracts investment from all over the world.

So, starting this week, I am leading 5 new ‘recovery roundtables’ bringing together businesses, business representative groups and leading academics.

They will consider measures to support economic recovery and ensure we have the right skills and opportunities in place for our workforce.

These sessions will feed directly into the government’s work on economic recovery and will help deliver the commitments we made to the British people only last December. These now take on an even greater sense of urgency and importance.

Because while we have a laser-like focus on the immediate public health challenge in front of us, we recognise our debt to businesses which have played such a vital role in combating coronavirus and keeping our economy moving.

And we will work, shoulder to shoulder, with our businesses as we get ready for our economic fight back.

Coronavirus press conference 18 April 2020.

Good afternoon,

Welcome to the coronavirus press conference from Downing Street.

I’m joined by Steve Powis, national medical director of NHS England.

Steve will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus shortly.

But, first, let me update you on the steps we are taking to defeat it, and the decisions we have taken today.

Our fight against this virus is happening all across the country, in every home, in every community.

Today’s data shows that:

460,437 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out across Great Britain, including 21,389 tests carried out yesterday

114,217 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 5,526 cases since yesterday

17,759 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in Great Britain, down from 18,711 yesterday

And sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 15,464 have now died. That’s an increase of 888 fatalities since yesterday.

These are heart-breaking losses for every family affected.

Every part of our government, from Whitehall to your local town hall is working together in this national effort.

And nowhere is that clearer than on the front lines in our communities.

And today as Community Secretary I want to provide an update.

Councils are delivering essential supplies to clinically vulnerable people - those we have asked to shield themselves, paying out financial relief to businesses to enable their local economies to weather the storm as much as is possible, ensuring our bins continue to be collected, ensuring that schools remain open for the children of key workers and vulnerable families are kept in regular contact, and they are helping rough sleepers off the streets to protect them from the virus.

This effort, alongside the endeavours of all our public servants, is making a difference in this fight.

But I know it is our responsibility in government to make sure that those front-line workers have the resources they need to keep up this essential work.

At the beginning of this emergency I told local councils that we would give them the resources they need to do the job. And I meant it.

And that is why today I am providing an additional £1.6 billion of new funding to support councils with the pressures they face as they respond to COVID-19.

This funding takes the total amount given to councils to help them through the pandemic to over £3.2 billion.

We are backing councils to ensure vital services such as adult social care, children’s services, support for vulnerable people and waste collection continue despite the increased pressures.

We are also helping councils with inevitable cashflow challenges by deferring £2.6 billion in business rates payments to central government and paying them £850 million in social care grants up front this month.

Working with councils and charities, we’ve made huge progress in protecting the vulnerable during this national emergency.

Our plans to shield the most clinically vulnerable people have progressed well.

Three weeks ago I reported at this press conference that the first government organised boxes of supplies had been delivered by wholesalers to those at highest risk across the country. Today 250,000 have been delivered. The packages include cereal, fruit, tinned goods, teabags, biscuits, toiletries and other essentials.

And this coming week we expect to be delivering 300,000 boxes – all from a standing start just a few weeks ago.

And our call centre is making up to 130,000 calls a day to those who are shielded, to see if they need this service, to see if they still need it or want to move to a priority delivery slot at their local supermarket.

In addition to this, councils are organising their own calls, often led by volunteers, including our 750,000 NHS volunteers, to check in and chat with the shielded.

And they have organised their own efforts to support those who may not have one of the clinical conditions to be shielded but are nonetheless vulnerable or isolated. And there are truly extraordinary efforts underway in this regard, in every village, parish, town, ward, estate and city, the length and breadth of the country.

We have all been humbled by the gestures, large and small, by people across the country to show support for those working so hard to protect the NHS and to save lives. None more so than Captain Tom Moore, who has raised an astonishing £23 million this week for NHS charities.

I can’t think of a more worthy person to be the guest of honour at the opening of the new Nightingale hospital in Harrogate next week – also, fittingly, the county of his birth, Yorkshire.

I am sure everyone will join me in thanking Captain Tom for his truly heroic effort.

I have also been proud of the effort of councils to help vulnerable people in their areas, including securing safe accommodation for rough sleepers.

And our plan to protect rough sleepers has resulted in over 90% being offered safe accommodation.

I want to thank all those who have made this possible, including local councils, charities and other organisations and those continuing to help the small number of people still regrettably on our streets today.

Of course, this is not the end of rough sleeping. And there is a great deal of work to be done and my departments and I will be at the heart of that.

I want to also say something about support for our high streets and local businesses by local councils.

I’m delighted that so many cafes, restaurants and other businesses have taken up the opportunity to switch to offering delivery, takeaway and click and collect services. This expands the supply of food available to people alongside the supermarkets, as well as allowing businesses that would otherwise have closed to remain open and keep paying staff.

This simple freedom has been taken up by enterprising people the length across the UK. The same enterprising people whose enguinity, sometimes assisted by government in modest ways like this, will help us to rebuild our economy.

Councils have worked hard to pay out over £1 billion worth of business grants from government.

But it’s vital that we all ensure that all eligible businesses get the support that it needs, and I urge councils who have been slower in making progress to their accelerate efforts in the days to come.

Let me address two other topics that I know are of concern to people.

Firstly, there have been examples of some parks around the country closing.

This cannot be right.

While the virus does not discriminate, we know that the lockdown is much harder for people who don’t have a lot of living space, who don’t have a garden, and who don’t have anywhere for their children to run around.

People need parks.

That’s why I have made it clear to councils that all parks must remain open.

For the health of the nation, people should be able to safely enjoy fresh air and green space.

And, for the health of the nation, people must abide by social distancing rules and not congregate in groups in parks.

Secondly, there have been some reports of mourners being turned away at funerals.

The tragedy of the death of Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, a 13 year old boy from Brixton, was compounded by the fact that his family were unable to attend his funeral.

That is not right and it shouldn’t have happened.

For clarity – funerals can go ahead with close family present.

Social distancing measures must be respected, but families must have the opportunity to say a respectful goodbye to those that they love.

We will be publishing more guidance on this shortly. And I’m also asking councils to keep open or indeed reopen cemeteries and graveyards. Not for people to congregate in. That must not happen. But for people to make that private visit. To seek solace in a word at the grave of someone you have loved. Or to privately lay flowers. There have been times in my life when I have needed to do that. I’m certain there are people who need to do it today.

These are small steps. But small mercies can make a big difference.

And local councils, at their best, can help to make life, even in times like this, more liveable and more humane.

They represent and can harness the networks of familiarity and loyalty upon which a society is based.

The sense that we belong together. And that we will stand by each other in a real emergency.

Those relationships can only be built from below, by people, to people, in communities.

To all the unsung heroes of local councils. For all you are doing for us all.

Thank you.","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government and The Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP",2020-04-18,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/communities-secretary-robert-jenrick-on-covid-19-response-18-april-2020"

Coronavirus press conference 20 April 2020.

Good evening from Downing Street, where I’m joined by Professor Angela McLean, Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser, and Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England.

Before I provide an update on the economic situation, let me start by addressing the issue uppermost on people’s minds – personal protective equipment, or PPE.

This is an international challenge that many other countries are experiencing.

Alongside the efforts of British businesses and our embassies around the world, we are working hard to get the PPE our frontline NHS and social care staff need.

We have appointed Paul Deighton, formerly Chief Executive of London 2012 Olympics, to lead on our domestic efforts to make an increase the supply of PPE.

And we are receiving shipments of PPE regularly from suppliers in the UK and abroad.

We’re working to resolve the Turkish shipment of PPE as soon as possible, following some unexpected delays at the weekend.

Today, we have unloaded a shipment of 140,000 gowns from Myanmar.

And we are, of course, continuing to pursue every possible option for PPE procurement.

Let me turn now to the economic situation.

Exactly a month ago today I stood at this lectern and said we would step in and help pay to people’s wages.

We promised this support would be available by the end of April – today, we deliver our promise.

HMRC opened the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme at 8 o’clock this morning.

As of 4 o’clock this afternoon, over 140,000 firms have applied…

and the grants they’ll receive will help pay the wages of more than a million people…

…a million people who, if they hadn’t been furloughed, would have been at risk of losing their job.

Firms applying today should receive their cash in six working days. HMRC will continue to provide updates on the number of people furloughed.

And let me put on record my thanks to the thousands of staff at HMT and HMRC who have made this happen.

People have come out of retirement, put aside their normal duties, and worked around the clock, from their kitchen tables and spare rooms, to get this new system up and running.

This remarkable story of public service reminds us how many different people are playing a role in this crisis – and I’m very grateful to all of them, for everything they’ve done.

It’s important to be clear why we have introduced the CJRS, and the other schemes we’ve put in place to support the self-employed and businesses.

We’ve never seen an economic crisis like this one.

Times like this demand that we put aside ideology and orthodoxy.

Times like this demand that the state turns to its most immediate purpose: the protection and support of its people.

The goal of the new schemes we’ve developed is to maintain as many people as possible in their existing jobs;

to support viable businesses to stay afloat;

and to protect the incomes of the self-employed to allow them to trade again.

To maintain, in other words, our economy’s productive capacity so that we can bridge through this crisis.

That is what we have done – and the Office for Budget Responsibility said last week that the situation would have been much worse if it hadn’t been for our actions.

But in everything we have done, even in our defence against the immediate crisis, we have also been sowing the seeds of our ultimate recovery.

As we look ahead and start to plan for our recovery, it is critical we don’t just maintain companies and jobs that already exist…

…but that we also encourage the businesses, jobs and technologies of the future.

Innovation and entrepreneurship have powered growth in our country for centuries; and it is what will drive our growth as we recover from this crisis.

To that end, earlier today, I launched two initiatives to support the most innovative firms in the county, worth £1.25 billion.

First, we are launching a new Future Fund worth £500 million, to make sure that high growth companies across the UK can continue to access the investment they need during the crisis.

Launching in May, the Future Fund will provide UK-based early stage companies with convertible loans between £125,000 and £5 million.

Our Future Fund will match investments made by private investors in early stage businesses, on terms that protect the UK taxpayer.

Second, alongside the new Future Fund, the Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, has worked closely with Innovate UK – our national innovation agency…

…to provide £750 million of grant and loan funding for tens of thousands of highly innovative firms…

…in every sector, and every region and nation of the UK.

He, like I, believes strongly in the role of innovation and enterprise in recovering our economy.

As I said last week, right now, the most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people.

We must continue to slow the spread of the virus;

to make sure fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time;

and protect the NHS’s ability to cope.

Today, the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme reports:

501,379 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out, including 19,316 tests carried out yesterday
  124,743 people have tested positive, an increase of 4,676 cases since yesterday
  17,971 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK
  and sadly, of those who have been hospitalised, 16,509 have now died - an increase of 449 fatalities since yesterday
Our thoughts are with the families and friends of all those who have lost their lives.

As we look forward, towards the next stage in our battle against this disease, there are encouraging signs we have been making progress.

But before we consider it safe to adjust any of the current social distancing measures, we must be satisfied that we have met the five tests set out last week by the First Secretary.

Those tests mean that the NHS can continue to cope;

that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently;

that the rate of infection is decreasing; that the operational challenges have been met;

and, most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peak.

So I want to thank each and every person across the UK who is following the government’s advice to stay at home, protect our NHS and, ultimately, save lives.

Thank you.

Coronavirus press conference 7 April 2020.

Good afternoon, welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m joined by Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and our Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty.

Before we get on to the detail, can I first give an update on the condition of the Prime Minister. I know a lot of people will be concerned about that.

I can tell you he is receiving the very best care from the excellent medical team at St Thomas’ hospital. He remained stable overnight, he’s receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any assistance. He has not required mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support. He remains in good spirits and, in keeping with usual clinical practice, his progress continues to be monitored closely in critical care.

We will give further updates on the Prime Minister’s condition, when there are any material developments.

And I know that there’s been a groundswell of messages of support from people here at home, from leaders around the world and I know that everyone will want to join with me in wishing the Prime Minister a very swift recovery.

As you will know, the Prime Minister asked me to deputise for him whilst he recovers. In line with the Prime Minister’s instructions, this morning I chaired the meeting of senior ministers tackling coronavirus and this afternoon I chaired an update for members of the Cabinet.

And I think it’s probably worth just worth remembering that, as will be the case for so many people up and down the country, who knows someone at work at work who has fallen ill with coronavirus, it comes as a shock to all of us. He’s not just the Prime Minister, and for all of us in Cabinet he’s not just our boss, he’s also a colleague and he’s also our friend.

So, all of our thoughts and prayers are with the Prime Minister at this time, with Carrie and with his whole family.

And I’m confident he’ll pull through because if there’s one thing I know about this Prime Minister, he’s a fighter and he’ll be back at the helm leading us through this crisis in short order. And for us in the Cabinet, we know exactly what he wants from us and what he expects from us right now.

And following the Cabinet discussion today,  I can reassure the Prime Minister, and we can reassure the public, that his team will not blink, and we will not flinch from the task at hand at this crucial moment. We will keep all of our focus and all of our resolve, with calm determination on delivering the government’s plan to defeat the coronavirus.

And it’s with that objective and that unity of purpose, that Cabinet turned to business today.

We had reports from the 4 Ministerial Groups on the action we’re taking across all of the strategic priority areas: including NHS capacity, procurement of ventilators and personal protective equipment, then delivery of public services including social care, on the economy and our support for both businesses and workers, and of course on the international action we’re taking to reinforce our efforts on all of the home front.

As we’ve explained before, our action plan aims to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, and that will help us protect the NHS’s ability to cope. At every step, we have been following the scientific advice, the medical advice, and we’ve been very deliberate in our actions that we’ve taken, so that we take the right steps at the right moment in time.

We are increasing our NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the number of beds, key staff, life-saving equipment on the front-line, so people have the care they need when they need it most. As we’ve consistently said, we are instructing people to stay at home, so we can protect the NHS and so that we can save lives.

So today I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme that, as of today:


    213,181 people have now been tested for the coronavirus
  
  
    55,242 people have tested positive
  
  
    the number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms now stands at 18,589
  
  
    of those who have contracted the virus, 6,159 have, I am very sorry to say, died
  
Every death in this pandemic is a tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones grieving at what must be an incredibly difficult time.

I think these figures reinforce that the single most important thing we can all do right now, in this national effort to defeat the virus, is to keep on following the government’s advice to:

stay at home
  protect our NHS
  and save lives

Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing. I’m joined by the Chief Nursing Officer, Ruth May, and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Jonathan Van Tam.

Our plan is to protect life and to protect the NHS, both by slowing the spread of this virus so we flatten the curve, and by ensuring that the NHS always has more capacity to provide critical care for those in need.

Now, this is a national effort and every single person in this country can play their part in this plan. This Easter will be another test of the nation’s resolve. It’s a time of year when people normally come together. But, however warm the weather, however tempting your local beach or park, we need everyone to stay at home because, in hospitals across the country, NHS staff are battling day and night to keep desperately sick people breathing.

And they need you to stay at home. I’m very happy to report that the Prime Minister’s condition continues to improve. He wants to personally thank the whole clinical team at St Thomas’s for the incredible care that he has received. His thoughts are with all of those who have been affected by this terrible disease. The NHS is there for all of us in this country and I know our amazing NHS staff have given the Prime Minister the very best care possible, in the same way that they would give every single person in this country the very best care possible.

One of the things that makes me proud of this country is that it doesn’t matter who you are, the NHS is always there to care for you.

Before updating you on our plan, I want to share the latest data from the ongoing monitoring and testing programme.

Yesterday, I am glad to report that 19,116 tests were carried out across Great Britain. 5,706 tested positive. The number of people currently in hospital with coronavirus symptoms is 19,304. Of those who’ve contracted the virus, 8,958 have sadly died, an increase of 980 since yesterday.

We never forget that behind this number, behind each one, is a name, a loss and a family that will never be the same again, and we all share a responsibility to tackle this virus first and foremost by staying at home.

Now, earlier this month, I outlined our 5-pillar testing strategy and I’m glad to report a very positive response to setting out the goal of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month. I can announce today that we have capacity for all key social care staff and NHS staff who need to be tested to get those tests.

To deliver this, in addition to the testing being done in NHS hospitals, we’ve now opened 15 drive-through testing centres, including in Glasgow, Cardiff, Belfast, Nottingham, Plymouth, Leeds and London, and other places.

The UK life sciences industry is also answering our call to arms. Yesterday, I opened our first of our 3 ‘Lighthouse’ mega-labs in Milton Keynes. 2 more are on track, in Cheshire and in Glasgow, and AstraZeneca and GSK, 2 of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, are opening another in Cambridge. And I want to thank the team and all the volunteers who are working day and night to make this happen.

Today, I want to address what we are doing to make sure that we have enough PPE, protective equipment, and to make sure that it gets to the right people. The goal I’ve set is that everyone working in a critical role must get the PPE that they need.

NHS and care staff protect us – every day, while we are safe at home, they go off to work to care for us. We owe it to them to get them the kit they need to protect themselves.

I want to be frank about the challenges our plan is designed to overcome. First, there is a huge international demand for PPE and a global squeeze on supply. Compounding this, some countries have placed export bans and other restrictions on PPE as they look to secure their domestic needs.

Next, there’s high demand for PPE from within the UK. So, everyone should use this equipment, use the equipment they clinically need, in line with the guidelines, no more and no less.

Then, of course, there’s the challenge of distribution. The sheer quantity and type of PPE needed has radically changed because of coronavirus. Many parts of the NHS and social care have never had to rely on weekly PPE deliveries before. In normal times, the NHS supply chain for protective equipment supplies 233 hospital trusts. Right now, 58,000 separate health and care providers need PPE.

So, we’ve had to create a whole new logistics network essentially from scratch. All of these challenges around supply, around usage and distribution are being overcome, and I want to take a moment to set out in detail how.

Today, we’re publishing our PPE plan. It has 3 strands.

Strand 1 is about guidance: being clear who needs PPE, when they need it and who does not. There is enough PPE to go around, but only if it’s used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is. That means only using it when there is a clinical need, and not using more than is needed.

Last week, following extensive consultation with the medical royal colleges, all 4 UK governments published updated guidance for what PPE to use in what circumstances. The new guidance included the clinical advice that many items of PPE can be used for a whole session, not be changed after treating each individual patient. Everyone is still protected but there’s enough PPE to go around.

The guidance is also clear where PPE is not needed. Because, outside of health and social care, in most circumstances, the best way to protect yourself and to protect others is to regularly wash your hands, and wherever possible to keep at least 2 metres between you and other people when you leave your house.

And of course the most important way to protect yourself is to stay at home. Because a front door is better than any face mask.

The second strand of our PPE plan is about distribution: making sure that anyone who needs PPE can get it, and at the right time. This is a herculean logistical effort. We’ve brought together the NHS, private industry and the armed forces to create a giant PPE distribution network on an unprecedented scale. That network is now delivering daily to our frontline heroes. Quite literally.

Since the start of the outbreak, we’ve now delivered over 742 million pieces of PPE to the frontline. This includes 161 million masks, 127 million aprons, 1 million gowns and 345 million pairs of gloves. These have reached hospitals, ambulance trusts, GP settings, social care, hospices and community pharmacies. We’ve also set up a 24/7 hotline for any providers experiencing supply problems.

And crucially, every NHS hospital has received a delivery of critical PPE once every 72 hours, and over the next week we’re making that daily. This week we’ve arranged a priority drop of 30 million items of PPE to the Local Resilience Forums. The LRFs are in turn delivering to social care and others according to local need.

And, in the coming weeks, we’ll be scaling up our PPE delivery systems still further. I can announce that over the next 3 weeks, we’re rolling out an online portal, allowing primary care and social care a system so that they can request PPE from a central inventory, and this will mean we can track demand in real time and deliver according to need.

This herculean effort of enormous operational complexity to get the right piece of equipment to the right person at the right moment, I pay tribute to the enormous efforts of all of those making it happen. We will do everything we possibly can to keep improving this, but I also want to take a moment to say thank you to all those involved.

The third strand is about future supply, which is making sure we have enough PPE to see us through the crisis. We are using up PPE on an unprecedented scale, so we are constantly buying more from abroad and now making it at home.

Our PPE sourcing unit is securing new supply lines from across the world, ensuring that what we buy meets rigorous standards. This includes teams from the Foreign Office and the Department of International Trade, out in the Far East especially, buying directly from manufacturers, and teams in Whitehall focused on rapid freight operations to get it here. We’ve published the standards that we’ll buy against, along with our global shopping list.

And it’s also about ramping up domestic production as well. Going into the crisis, we did not have a major domestic PPE manufacturing industry. So, like with ventilators and testing, we’re creating one.

Many businesses have generously come forward with offers to turn over their production lines as part of this national effort. In particular, I want to thank Burberry, with their offers of gowns; Rolls-Royce and McLaren, who are creating visors; Ineos and Diageo, who are producing hand sanitiser. We’re talking to many others and we want more to step up to the plate.

So, if you’ve got production facilities and you can meet our published technical specifications, we want to hear from you so we can make this kit here in Britain that will keep people safe. This is our comprehensive PPE plan to protect the people who protect us to make sure they have the kit they need to do their jobs safely and with confidence.

But, I want to finish by saying this. Even if you’re not directly involved in the NHS, in the PPE supply chain, in testing or as a key worker, there is something that everyone of us can do to play your part in the national effort.

Stay at home.

Because spreading the virus today risks lives tomorrow. And it increases pressure on those who work in the NHS.

Do it for them. Do it for the people who you love.

The more we follow the rules, the faster we can lift these restrictions and get back towards normal life. Thank you to all those of you who are already doing your bit as part of our national effort.

Stay well, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-04-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-10-april-2020"
"104","Speech","Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 28 April 2020","Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock gave the 28 April 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Coronavirus press conference: 28 April 2020

Welcome once again to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.

I’m joined today by Professor John Newton, our testing coordinator, and Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor Angela McLean.

This morning, at 11 o’clock, we paused to remember the 85 NHS colleagues and 19 social care colleagues who have lost their lives with coronavirus.

It was a moment of solemn reflection for so many of us and of unbearable sadness for some.

They are the nation’s fallen heroes. And we will remember them.

Every day we are working through our plan to protect life and protect the NHS, slowing the spread and building capacity, so that the NHS at all times can offer the very best care to everyone, because we’ve got the beds, the ventilators and the staff available.

So far, thanks to the incredible work of NHS colleagues and the shared sacrifice of everyone watching at home, that plan is working.

The latest figures show 3,260 spare critical care beds available across the NHS.

On the most recent figures:

there have been 763,387 tests for coronavirus so far in the UK, including 43,453 yesterday
  161,145 people have tested positive: an increase of 3,996 cases since yesterday
  15,796 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus
  21,678 people have now sadly died in hospital, an increase of 586 since yesterday
This morning, the Office for National Statistics and the CQC published more information on the overall impact, including that there have been 4,343 notified deaths in care homes since Easter.

The proportion of coronavirus deaths in care homes is a sixth of the total, which is just below what we see in normal times.

I want to make sure that we bring as much transparency as possible to important information like this, and so, from tomorrow, we will be publishing not just the number of deaths in hospitals each day but the number of deaths in care homes and the community too, something that was not previously possible.

This will supplement the ONS and CQC weekly publications and all add to our understanding of how this virus is spreading day by day. And it will help the judgements that we will make as we work to keep people safe.

Behind every single death is a family’s heartbreak, and we must do everything humanly possible to save as many lives as we can.

We will not be changing the social distancing rules until our 5 tests have been met:

the NHS protected
  infection rates falling
  the number of deaths falling substantially
  the operational challenges around testing and PPE addressed
  and with no risk of a second spike
I want to update you on 2 other issues of major importance.

First, testing.

At the start of this month, I set the goal of 100,000 tests a day.

Every day, we’re ramping up this testing capacity, on track to meet that goal.

We are continuously opening new drive-through centres. There are now 41, with 48 going live this week.

For people who can’t get to the tests, we’re expanding home testing to bring the test to them. We are increasing the dispatch of home test kits from 5,000 a day last Friday to 25,000 a day by the end of this week.

At the weekend, 17 mobile testing units, manned by the army, were operational. By the end of the week, we plan to have over 70 deployed, with trained crews across the country.

All of this has led to an increase in daily testing capacity, which now stands at 73,400.

And this has allowed us progressively to expand access to testing.

We started with hospital patients, who have always had access to a test right the way through, ramping up to include symptomatic NHS and social care colleagues and their households, and then all essential workers.

Today, because we’ve been able to expand capacity, I can expand access further.

Building on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England and of patients and staff in the NHS.

This means anyone who is working or living in a care home will be able to get access to a test, whether they have symptoms or not.

I’m determined to do everything I can to protect the most vulnerable.

And we now have capacity to go further.

So, from now, we are making testing available to all over-65s and their households with symptoms, and to all workers who would have to leave home in order to go to work and members of their households who have symptoms, from construction workers to emergency plumbers, research scientists to those in manufacturing.

This expansion of access to testing will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe. And it’s possible because we have expanded capacity for testing thus far.

Next, I want to update you on our COVID-19 therapeutics work.

This is research to understand whether existing drugs could be used to treat people more effectively once they’ve developed the disease.

Currently no drugs in the world have been clinically proven to treat COVID-19.

But our Therapeutics Taskforce has identified a number of promising candidates.

Currently 6 different treatments have been entered into national clinical trials and the first is ready to enter the next stage: a new early phase clinical trial platform that we are launching today.

This is a national effort made possible by government, academia and industry working together.

In addition, we need to make the best possible use of all the medicines we have.

We’re updating the guidelines for the use of medicines in care homes, removing a barrier so that, for the period of the pandemic, where it’s clinically appropriate, medicines that have been labelled for use by one patient can be used by another who needs them, instead of being destroyed. Clinicians and colleagues in social care have called for this change, which is already standard procedure in hospitals.

Right across government, we are working day and night to defeat this virus:

ramping up testing capacity
  investigating new drugs and treatments
  backing vaccine development
  securing and distributing billions of items of PPE

  getting the NHS whatever resources it needs to make sure that it is always there to treat everybody who needs it
The risk of a second peak is real, but as a nation we are holding it at bay, so please stick with it: stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-04-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-28-april-2020"
"105","Speech","High-level event on financing for development: UK statement on sustainable recovery after COVID-19","Dominic Raab spoke at the UN General Assembly during UNGA 2020, setting out the UK's 3 priorities for recovering better for sustainability after coronavirus.","Thank you to the UN Secretary-General and the Prime Ministers of Canada and Jamaica for hosting this event.

It’s an honour to join you today for this event, and as my Prime Minister said in May, we owe it to future generations to build back better. We must use our recovery from COVID-19 to accelerate, not slow down our delivery of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.

The UK is proud to co-lead on Recovering Better For Sustainability alongside the European Union, Fiji and Rwanda.

So today I want to focus on 3 particular priorities, but I urge you to consider our full set of proposals as you plan your recoveries in each of your respective countries.

First, we must build strong and resilient health systems to achieve universal health coverage that protects us all from health threats, whether they’re COVID or non-COVID. The UK has already committed over 1 billion US dollars of aid to tackle COVID-19.

Second, we must deliver a green recovery that lives up to the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. We need governments to submit more ambitious, Nationally Determined Contributions, develop long-term strategies and put these at the heart of their national economic recovery plans.

The UK has announced over £5 billion to implement a domestic green recovery, we’re providing international support through our ambitious climate finance commitment.

And third, our global recovery must be inclusive and support the most vulnerable who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and climate change. We must commit to leaving no one behind. And that includes standing up for gender equality and in particular, every girl’s right to 12 years of quality education.

Next up, we know that COVID-19 has exacerbated longstanding debt vulnerabilities. The G20 debt service suspension initiative was valuable, but we’ve got to extend and fully implement it to provide the liquidity countries need to build back better.

As COP26 and G7 presidents next year, we’re asking for a global effort. Now more than ever, we must come together to drive forward these changes so that we can get back on our feet and look to the future with ambition, with confidence and with greater unity forged in the global challenges that we’ve overcome together.

Thank you.","Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP",2020-09-29,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-statement-to-the-high-level-event-on-financing-for-development"
"106","Speech","Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 27 March 2020","Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove made a statement on coronavirus.","Welcome everybody to the government’s daily briefing.

I am joined today by the Chief Executive Officer of the NHS, Simon Stevens, and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Jenny Harries.

I would like to update you all on the facts on the spread of COVID-19 and the steps we are taking in the battle against the coronavirus.

113,777 people have now been tested for the virus. Of those, 14,543 have tested positive. An increase in the last day of 2,885.

The best scientific analysis now is that the rate of infection has been doubling every 3-4 days.

And of those who have contracted the virus, 759 have, sadly, died. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who have passed away.

These figures are a powerful reminder of the need for all of us to act.

We need to slow the spread of the virus and strengthen the NHS’s ability to protect us all.

Strict social distancing measures have been put in place to restrict the spread of COVID-19 so fewer people should need hospital treatment at any one time.

The measures we have put in place follow scientific and medical advice and are designed to reduce the rate of infection.

And as well as acting to slow the spread of the virus, we are also acting to strengthen the NHS.

We are expanding the number of beds available for new patients, we are increasing the number of staff in our hospitals and we are also investing in life-saving equipment for those with severe symptoms to give people the care they need when they need it most.

I would like to thank all those involved in this effort to reinforce the frontline in the battle against the virus:

The military personnel who are helping to fit out a new hospital in east London and who are helping to distribute personal protective equipment. The amazing doctors, nurses and support staff in our NHS. Those in manufacturing who have risen to the challenge of producing new ventilators and the hundreds of thousands who have volunteered to help in innumerable ways.

This is a united national effort and the spirit of selflessness shown by so many is truly inspiring.

And this virus, of course, affects us all.

As you are no doubt already aware, the Prime Minister has coronavirus and is self-isolating at home in Downing Street.

He began experiencing mild symptoms yesterday afternoon and was tested on the advice of England’s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty.

The Prime Minister is continuing to lead the government’s response to coronavirus – chairing meetings and communicating with key members of his team through video conferencing.

And earlier today the Prime Minister led the effort in launching our latest front in the fight against COVID-19.

Today I can announce that the Prime Minister has brought together businesses, research institutes and universities in a new alliance to boost testing capacity for frontline workers.

Increasing our testing capacity is absolutely crucial in our response to and our fight against coronavirus. This is a particular priority for those who work in the health and social care sector and are working so hard to keep us all safe.

This will be antigen testing - testing whether people currently have the disease - so that our health and social care workers can have security in the knowledge that they are safe to return to work if their test is negative.

These tests will be trialled for people on the front line starting immediately - with hundreds to take place by the end of the weekend, dramatically scaling up next week.

And of course protecting our frontline workers is at the forefront of everyone’s minds at the moment.

Last night, millions of people paid a fantastic tribute to the heroes and heroines of the NHS when they stepped outside their front doors and clapped our carers.

And alongside those in health and social care, I also want to thank those who work in food production and retail, those who work for the Royal Mail and public transport, our teachers and our social workers. They all deserve our gratitude.

Having talked to trade union and business leaders, civil servants and public spirited volunteers and of course ministers in the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in recent days, I want to record my admiration for the national solidarity being shown in the fight against this disease.

All of us can support our NHS by continuing to follow the guidance to:

To stay at home.

To protect our NHS.

And to save lives.

I’ll now turn to the Chief Executive Officer of the NHS, Simon Stevens.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP",2020-04-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-duchy-of-lancaster-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-27-march-2020"
"107","Speech","Communities Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 31 May 2020","The Communities Secretary on the government’s response to COVID-19.","video

As Communities Secretary, I will be updating you on our support for the most vulnerable people in society, I’ll be updating you on how we’re shielding people from coronavirus in England, and the next steps in our programme of support for rough sleepers during this pandemic.

But first, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.

4,285,738 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 115,725 tests carried out yesterday
  274,762 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,936 cases since yesterday
  7,639 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down 15 % from 8,945 this time last week
  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 38,489 have now died. That’s an increase of 113 fatalities since yesterday.
Behind each of those deaths is a mourning family, and heartbroken friends and loved ones. Our thoughts and prayers, as ever, are with all of them.

At the start of this pandemic, we advised Clinically Extremely Vulnerable people to shield until the 30 June. These are individuals who are most at risk of severe illness if they contract the virus – so protecting them has been especially important during the pandemic.

I think it’s important to explain who is shielding.

They are not exclusively older people. Over half are under 70. Over 90,000 of them are actually children and they sadly will not be able to return to school tomorrow if their year group is. And hundreds of thousands of those shielding are – or were – at work before the pandemic. Many of these people are working from home, but where this is not possible, they are unable to do the jobs I am sure they would wish to be doing.

The one thing they all have in common is that they have made a huge sacrifice. I would like to echo the Prime Minister in recognising the resilience of people shielding across the country and express our admiration for their ongoing efforts.

We know that they often live with other people, so this has had profound impact on their lives as well – and family members have often had to sacrifice a lot to protect the people they love the most. And I know that a significant number of those shielding haven’t left the house at all for 9 or 10 weeks – that is quite an extraordinary restriction on their lives.

For those who were advised to shield, we set up the National Shielding Service, a huge logistical exercise, unprecedented since the Second World War.

This has included delivering over two and half million free food boxes, securing priority supermarket delivery services, ensuring people could get medicines delivered to their doorstep, and working closely in partnership with local government and our fantastic NHS volunteer responders helping people in a myriad of other ways, be that delivering shopping, calling people for a ‘check in and chat’ or providing essential care.

Over 350,000 who are shielding have registered for some support from government, like food, like medicine deliveries. But more than half of those shielding have also said to us they want someone to talk to over the phone – so none of us should forget the emotional burden isolation places upon people, and the effects on mental health and general wellbeing.

For anyone, shielding or not, it’s important you seek the help you need. And it is available despite the restrictions. So please, if this is you go to GOV.UK or the Every Mind Matters website for advice and practical steps as to what you can do and the support that’s available for your wellbeing during this time.

I am immensely grateful to all of those in the NHS who have and continue to go above and beyond to support those most at risk during the virus.

We also recognise the role of local councils and parish councils, who have supported their residents with great effect.

When we announced a gradual relaxation of restrictions in the last week, I know that many people who are shielding will have been asking: what about me?

Today we are setting out the next steps for the shielded.

Now that we’ve passed the peak and the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community has reduced significantly, we believe that the risk to those shielding is lower, as it is proportionately for the general population.

As with the guidance for shielded people more generally, we want to give people the information and advice they need to make the best decisions for them. This is, as always advisory, for the shielded.

So, as a first step, I can announce today that we have updated the shielding guidance so that from tomorrow, Monday the 1st  of June, people will be advised that they can take initial steps to safely spend time outdoors. This guidance is for England only but we are working very closely with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who will issue their own guidance in due course.

Those shielding will be able to spend time outdoors with members of their own household or, if they live alone, with one person from another household.

This reflects a lower risk of transmission outdoors, as well as the significantly reduced prevalence of COVID-19 in the community. The full guidance will be uploaded to GOV.UK later today.

You must still follow social distancing guidelines and remain at a 2 metre distance from others.

This will enable those shielding to see loved ones, like children and grandchildren.

Something many I know, are aching to do.

Having spent many weeks indoors, some will understandably be very cautious and concerned about going outdoors. You should only do what you are comfortable with.

In our road map we set out, while the shielding guidance is currently in place until the end of June, it may need to be extended beyond that point. Our guidance to those who are shielding will always be advisory, but it is also critical that it is based on the most up to date evidence and data.

So today, I can say that as part of each review for the social distancing measures for the wider population, we will also review the risks for the clinically extremely vulnerable and assess whether, as we currently believe, the shielding period needs to be extended, and whether it is possible for the shielding guidance to be eased further.

We will base each assessment on clinical advice from our medical experts, and the best data available about the prevalence of COVID-19 within the community.

The next review of shielding measures will take place the week commencing 15 June and will consider the next steps for the programme more generally beyond 30 June.

Following that review, the NHS will also write to all individuals on the shielding patient list with information about next steps on shielding advice and the support that will be available to them.

If the conditions become less favourable, our advice to those being asked to shield will unfortunately need to be tightened.

The Government will continue to ensure that support is available to those who need it for as long as possible and for as long as people are advised to follow shielding guidance.

Once again, can I thank all those shielding for your patience and fortitude thus far. Everyone in the country appreciates the unique challenges you face, and we want to continue to do all we can to ensure that whilst you may be at home, shielding, you are not alone.

Secondly, I wanted to provide an update on our work on rough sleeping. And I’m joined by the Prime Minister’s advisor on rough sleeping, Dame Louise Casey.

From the start of this pandemic, we believed we had a special duty to protect the most vulnerable people in our society. And this was especially necessary for those people sleeping rough on our streets.

Working hand-in-hand with charities and local councils, we have offered accommodation to over 90% of rough sleepers known to us at the start in order to help them stay to safe during the pandemic.

I want to thank everyone who has been involved in this huge national effort. Thousands of lives have been protected as a result of your work.

We’ve ensured councils in England have the funding to help continue housing rough sleepers in emergency accommodation as part of the £3.8 billion we’ve provided them in the last 2 months. And we will continue to fund this essential work to get the job done.

But, as we enter the next phase in our fight against coronavirus, it is right that we start to look ahead.

Our goal has always been that as few people as possible return to the streets. But words and promises are not enough.

Because of the action we have already taken, for the first time, in my lifetime, we know who the vast majority of rough sleepers are and where they are living.

That means we can assess each individual’s needs and tailor the support we provide next. Some people will need help to return to the private rental sector, but others will need accommodation to be provided so they can start to rebuild their lives.

That is why 6,000 new supported homes will be made available for rough sleepers, providing safe accommodation for people we have helped off the streets during the pandemic.

The government is backing this effort with £433 million to fast-track the safe accommodation desperately needed to ensure as few rough sleepers as possible return to the streets.

3,300 of these new homes will become available in the next 12 months, and £160 million will be spent this year to deliver that.

But rough sleeping is as much a health issue as it is a housing issue – it is a crisis of addiction and mental health as well.

So we will provide specialist support staff for rough sleepers in this new accommodation to ensure they can continue to receive the health support they will need to transform their lives and fulfil their potential.

These homes will be a springboard to better things. And they will serve as a new national asset and be a symbol of hope and our belief that no one’s path is predetermined.

I’m now going to pass over to Dame Louise Casey.","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government and The Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP",2020-05-31,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/communities-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-31-may-2020"
"108","Speech","Dame Glenys Stacey: speech to AOC's FE Summit, 18 November 2020","Dame Glenys Stacey's speech to the Association of Colleges' Further Education Summit, 18 November 2020.","Good morning and thank you for inviting me to join you today. Thank you for inviting me to speak today, I do appreciate it.

And thank you as well for all the exceptional work you are doing, to mitigate for your students the truly baleful and ongoing impact of the pandemic on education. I appreciate and applaud everyone’s efforts here and your resolve to best educate your students and protect their futures. It is outstanding in so many respects, but it is also what I have long known and respected, in the FE sector. A heartfelt thank you from me

Much of the talk in recent months has been of GCSEs and A levels but today I’d like to focus on vocational and technical qualifications. These are particularly important to many of your students, and they are increasing in prominence generally with the government’s Post-16 qualification review and the anticipated FE White Paper.

But first, I do want to make clear that we at Ofqual are sorry for what happened this summer: the distress and anxiety it caused for many students and their parents; the problem it created for teachers; and the impact it had on higher and further education providers. For our part, we are truly sorry for that.

The government has since renewed its commitment to examinations. I welcome that: we know this is generally the best way of testing knowledge and understanding, and the feedback we are getting from recent focus groups at Ofqual shows that parents and students, they are  welcoming it too. 
In this year, because of the pandemic, there are new challenges, in assessing the right things in the right ways, so that even under exceptional assessment and examination arrangements, we still want to get sufficiently valid and reliable results for your students.

Now, awarding organisations with high levels of subject knowledge and expertise have the ability to consider how the right things should be assessed, and how to adapt assessment in this exceptional year. But they must also have a deep understanding of how centres and your colleges operate and their student cohort, as well as the needs of future employers or higher education providers.

So, from my perspective, knowing the challenges on the ground, understanding the impact of change and appreciating how these qualifications are used is critical to developing appropriate assessment – not just this year, but for the longer-term future actually, as well as for this year.

With these things in mind, we are regulating awarding organisations in novel ways, in these extraordinary times. We have got something called the Extraordinary Regulatory Framework – bit of a mouthful, but it allows awarding organisations to use their judgement to adapt assessments and qualifications where necessary and appropriate.

Just thinking that through, particular skills and levels of practical competence are important for a student to be able to demonstrate their mastery and move into employment. Missed learning in key areas can make the difference between a student understanding safe and unsafe practices in some subject areas – and that is another key issue for us. Any changes proposed by awarding bodies do need to protect these key attributes of particular qualifications

And as AoC are telling us on your behalf, there have been difficulties in students accessing mandatory work placements as a result of the pandemic, so we have that to look at as well.

For those students intending to progress to higher education, often taking VTQs alongside A levels, there are other challenges. We know how important it is that there is coherence with GCSEs, AS and A levels. And so awarding organisations must try, as far as possible, to ensure that adaptations made to assessments do not advantage or disadvantage students against those taking GCSEs, AS and A levels. There needs to be a level playing field there.

Taking into account public health advice such as social distancing constraints, awarding organisations are putting in place a wide range of adaptations for vocational and technical qualifications to free up time for teaching and learning; and make these assessments as manageable and flexible as possible. And we’ve been encouraging professional bodies and employers to work closely with their awarding organisations so that students are not unreasonably penalised for loss of learning during this difficult time

So some examples then, assessment tasks or briefs may be available earlier or assessment windows extended. Assessments may be streamlined to free up for time for teaching and learning – without reducing the content that is taught. And, of course, there is the introduction of remote assessment and remote invigilation – allowing assessments to take place in different settings.

Now there are risks involved with these adaptations. We are monitoring how awarding organisations make use of these new freedoms, with a keen eye on validity, but also an awareness of the practicalities of assessment for many of these qualifications. For example we hear from you that the January RQF exams are likely to be logistically challenging – we’re actively looking at what we can do and we do recognise the need for early certainty.

And we are working closely with the awarding organisations and sector bodies, including AoC, to set in place consistent approaches wherever possible and appropriate. This is not only in relation to qualifications with much in common, such as functional skills qualifications, but also in relation to how and when awarding organisations communicate with you to help you receive the information you keenly need.

So just to finish off, and to look further ahead, we welcome the upcoming White Paper, of course, and government’s ambitions for a high quality, coherent qualification market which offers the right level of choice for all types of learners at all levels. We want to see the detail of that. In the meantime, we are strengthening our capacity and redoubling our efforts in anticipation – so for example, we are gathering and publishing more data than ever before about VTQs, and I will mention here our VTQ landscape explorer analytics tool, it’s a nice useful piece of kit that we’re updating on our website this week.

To finish, as you balance the necessary changes and adaptations during this pandemic with caring for your students’, and your own health and wellbeing, we, together with AoC, the awarding organisations, DfE and many other stakeholders across the whole sector, are working hard to safeguard sufficient validity in assessments but also keeping at heart the student perspective. Above all, we want students to have the reassurance and confidence that they have been treated fairly, and future employers to have confidence in the skills of their new employees.","Ofqual and Dame Glenys Stacey",2020-11-18,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/dame-glenys-stacey-speech-to-aocs-fe-summit-18-november-2020"
"109","Speech","Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 April 2020","Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock gave the 15 April 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Coronavirus press conference: 15 April 2020

Good afternoon and welcome to the daily coronavirus briefing.

I am joined by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and the Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser, Angela McLean.

I want to start by thanking everyone who is staying at home, even in this sunshine. Together, we are slowing the spread of this virus. And I want to pay a special tribute today to Captain Tom Moore who, at the age of 99, has raised over £7 million so far for NHS charities by completing 100 laps of his garden. Captain Tom, you’re an inspiration to us all and we thank you.

At the core of our plan is to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed, so its ability to care for everybody that needs that care is always there and is never outmatched by the ability of the virus to do us harm. That is central to our plan and I’m glad to say that the spare capacity in critical care in the NHS today has reached a new record high of 2,657 beds.

Expanding the NHS faster than the growth in demand has been a critical objective throughout this crisis. And it means that every single person who’s accessed NHS care has been able to get the very best available. At no point has the NHS been unable to offer care to people suffering from coronavirus. Now I know at the start of this crisis, some people said that would be impossible. But, so far, we’ve met this objective throughout and I want to thank all those involved for their part in this national effort.

On the most recent figures, 313,769 people have now been tested for coronavirus. Of these, 98,476 people have tested positive. The number of patients in hospital with symptoms is now 19,529. 12,868 people have sadly died, an increase of 761.

This all just goes to show why we cannot let up in our efforts. We cannot let go of the hard work that’s been done so far. This shared sacrifice, and I know it’s a sacrifice, is starting to work. But, we will not lift these measures until it is safe to do so. Everyone who stays at home is doing their bit, protecting the NHS and saving lives.

But, while everyone else stays at home to save lives, our health and care workers go out to work to save lives. And, today, I want to focus on social care. I want to set out the next steps in our action plan for social care that we’re publishing today.

From the moment of the emergence of coronavirus, we’ve known that some of the most vulnerable to this disease are in social care and we’ve been taking action right from the start.

We first set out guidance back in February and today I can tell you what further steps we’re now able to make. Our goal throughout has been to protect residents and to support our 1.5 million colleagues who work in social care. We’ve injected an extra £1.6 billion and, as the Chancellor said, we will do whatever it takes.

This is our plan.

First and foremost, from the start, we’ve focused on the need to control the spread of infection in social care settings. Today, we’ve strengthened the rules, so that all care home residents who are discharged from hospital will be tested before being admitted into their care home. We’ll test all symptomatic care home residents. And, as I announced last Friday, we’ve introduced testing for all social care colleagues and members of their households who need a test.

At the same time, we’re increasing again PPE supplies for social care. We’re creating a supply logistics and distribution network of unprecedented scale. Building on the PPE plan I set out on Friday, over the next 3 weeks we’ll continue priority drops to the Local Resilience Forums who distribute to the social care system according to local need, while we roll out our new online delivery system for social care settings. This will be integrated with the NHS supply chain central PPE logistical operations, with kit shipped directly to social care providers via the Royal Mail.

All of this will contribute to slowing the spread of coronavirus within care homes.

I want also to enhance support for our social care workforce. One of the things that I’m most proud of during this terrible crisis is that people have held health and social care workers in such high esteem. It’s not ‘clap for the NHS’, it’s ‘clap for our carers’. And to take this further, we’re today introducing a single brand for social care to symbolise the entire care profession. This is something I know so many people in the profession have called for.

This badge will be a badge of honour in a very real sense, allowing social care staff proudly and publicly to identify themselves, just like NHS staff do with that famous blue and white logo.

I know that many businesses will want to offer the same recognition and benefits as they do wonderfully to the NHS. We’ve asked the supermarkets to confirm that social care workers can have the same priority access and I know that the public value your work in care as much as I do. I also know that we need more people to return to social care or choose to serve for the first time.

To make that happen, we’re strengthening our national recruitment campaign with the aim of recruiting tens of thousands more people into social care. And we will pay for the initial induction training. This is a job where you have the chance to make a difference to people’s lives every single day that you go to work.

And I’ve seen, as I’m sure we’ve all seen, the amazing efforts of good social care. I’ve seen it with elderly members of my own family. I’ve seen the tenderness and the dedication with which people in social care support our loved ones at their time of greatest need.

Everyone knows the job isn’t easy. Whether supporting people of working age, who are some of the most vulnerable in society, or supporting people and their families with dignity at the end of their lives. But I know what a fulfilling profession it is and I know that many will answer our call.

There’s one other thing, and one other change, I want to make, which is giving people the right to say goodbye. One of the important things that care homes do is support people at the end of their life. Sadly, even in normal times, each month, about 10,000 people die in care homes. And our social care colleagues work incredibly hard to ensure support for people and dignity to people at the end of their lives.

Wanting to be with someone you love at the end of their life is one of the deepest human instincts. And it’s a moment that will be with you forever. Done right, it can help those left behind to cope and it brings comfort to those who are dying. Coronavirus of course has made this much more difficult. and I’ve been really moved and upset at some of the heart-breaking stories of people dying without a loved one nearby.

As a father of a 13-year-old myself, the reports of Ismail, dying aged 13 without a parent at his bedside, made me weep. And the sight of his coffin being lowered into a grave without a member of his family present was too awful. So, I’m pleased to say that, working with Public Health England, the care sector and many others, we’re introducing new procedures so we can limit the risk of infection, while, wherever possible, giving people’s loved ones the chance to say goodbye.

And we’re making crystal clear that it is unacceptable for advanced care plans, including ‘do not attempt to resuscitate’ orders, to be applied in a blanket fashion to any group of people. This must always be a personalised process, as it always has been.

I want to end by addressing carers directly. As much as the doctors, the nurses, the paramedics – you are on the frontline in this battle. I want to thank you for your courage and your commitment. For doing paid or unpaid, formal or informal, the work that you do, difficult, demanding, vitally necessary, and you do it with such love and care and attention.

Taking on the extra shifts that might be needed to fill the gaps left by self-isolating colleagues, juggling your own caring responsibilities very often, providing dignity and comfort to people in some of the most difficult circumstances. We, as a nation, stand with you.

And I say to everyone watching, you can stand with our carers too. By staying at home, to protect the NHS and protect social care, and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-04-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-15-april-2020"

Welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.

Before we start, I wanted to let you know that today’s briefing will follow a bit of a new format.

Following significant demand, as well as questions from the media, we will take our first question from a member of the public.

This is going to become a regular feature of these briefings. The questions are selected by an independent polling organisation and, just like the journalist’s questions, we don’t see the questions in advance.

But we’ll give them the very best answers we can.

In the past few hours, since we announced this new approach, we’ve had over 15,000 questions submitted. And you can ask a question yourself, by going to gov.uk/ask.

Today, I’m joined by Professor Chris Whitty and Professor Stephen Powis, the NHS Medical Director.

The government is working through our action plan, and at its core the objective is to protect life and to protect the NHS. Both by slowing the spread of the virus so we flatten the curve and by ensuring that the NHS always has more than enough capacity to provide critical care for all those who need it.

According to the most recent figures, there have been 719,910 tests for coronavirus so far in the UK, including 37,024 yesterday. 157,149 people have tested positive. That’s an increase of 4,310 cases since yesterday. 15,051 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 15,239 yesterday. And, sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 21,092 have now died. That’s an increase of 360 fatalities.

We must never lose sight of the human cost of coronavirus and the pain and the grief that it causes.

And each death serves as a reminder that we must stand firm in our resolve.

Sadly, these death figures include 82 NHS colleagues and 16 colleagues who work in social care.

They dedicated their lives to caring for others. And I feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones.

Today, I am able to announce that the government is setting up a Life Assurance Scheme for NHS and social care frontline colleagues.

Families of staff who die from coronavirus in the course of their essential frontline work will receive a £60,000 payment.

Of course, nothing replaces the loss of a loved one. But we want to do everything we can to support families who are dealing with this grief.

And, as a government, we are looking closely at other professions that work on the frontline against coronavirus, who also do not have access to such schemes, to see where this may be required.

This crisis has shown that this country values our health and care workers so much.

And I want to pay tribute to the perseverance of the British public who, even this warm Spring weekend, in their vast majority, did the right thing and stayed home to protect the NHS.

Thus far, in this crisis, at every single hour of every single day, the NHS has always had the capacity to treat the people who need that treatment.

I’m glad to be able to report that there are now 3,190 spare critical care beds.

Indeed, 42% of oxygen-supported beds in the NHS now lie empty.

And, in most parts of the country, the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is beginning to fall.

One of reasons NHS capacity has always exceeded need is because of our amazing programme of NHS Nightingale hospitals.

Today, I was proud to attend, virtually, the opening of the 8th of our 10 Nightingale hospitals across the UK, again, built in a matter of weeks.

This Nightingale Hospital project stands as a monument to this nation’s ability to get things done when it matters.

This is one of the most ambitious projects this country has ever seen in peacetime and I’d like to thank the NHS, the armed forces and all the companies that have worked side by side to make these plans a reality.

The Nightingale project is just one of the measures that’s boosted capacity all across the NHS.

By re-enlisting thousands of former staff, former clinicians and enrolling early thousands of students, we’ve boosted the workforce of the NHS.

And we have changed forever the digital capability of the NHS.

I think many people who have now used online GP consultations and online outpatient visits won’t ever go back. And I pay tribute to the staff who have worked in different ways to how they would ever have imagined and who have been more flexible and open to change when it was really needed.

So, where there have been advances amongst these huge challenges of this crisis, we must not lose them.

However, we also know that fewer people are coming to the NHS when they need to.

A&E attendances have dropped to 221,000 emergency department attendances in the last week, compared to 477,000 for the same week last year. That’s more than 50%.

Now, some of this drop is due to lower road traffic and people following the social distancing rules.

Some of it will be due to people accessing the NHS in ways that work better for them, like online or through pharmacies. And that’s a good thing.

But, in some cases, we know that the drop is due to people not coming forward and using the NHS for critical things that matter.

Our message is that the NHS is open. Help us to help you. So, if you’re worried about chest pains for instance, maybe you might be having a heart attack or a stroke, or you feel a lump and you’re worried about cancer, or you’re a parent concerned about your child, please come forward and seek help as you always would.

It is so important that everybody uses the NHS responsibly.

And the NHS will always be there for you when you need it. Just as it has been there for us all throughout this crisis, and throughout our lives.

And, as the number of hospitalisations from coronavirus begins to fall, I can announce now that starting tomorrow we will begin the restoration of other NHS services, starting with the most urgent, like cancer care and mental health support.

The exact pace of the restoration will be determined by local circumstances on the ground, according to local need and according to the amount of the coronavirus cases that the hospital is having to deal with.

Having written off £13.4 billion worth of historic NHS debt during the coronavirus crisis, I want to ensure that the NHS is always there. In a way that doesn’t just help us to recover from coronavirus as a country, but also puts us in a stronger position for the future.

We are coming through the peak.

We will honour those who have dedicated their lives to caring for others. But, it will count for nothing if we let things slip now and risk a second peak.

I know that the lockdown is hard for so many people. But, let us all have the resolve to see this through.

So please stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-04-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-27-april-2020"
"111","Speech","Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 April 2020","Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock gave the 3 April 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Coronavirus press conference: 3 April 2020

Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press briefing. I’m joined by our Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Professor Jonathan Van Tam, and by the Chief Nurse, Ruth May.

Our plan is to save as many lives as possible by protecting the NHS and preventing it from being overwhelmed. And we’re doing this in 2 ways.

One, by slowing the spread of the virus, and that’s why it is so important that people stay at home. And that’s true for everyone who’s watching – how important it is that we stay at home.

And two, by boosting the capacity of the NHS to care for those who fall sick. That means more beds, more staff, more life-saving equipment and more effective treatments – we’ll come on to that.

Coronavirus continues its grim march. I can report that, through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, according to the latest figures as of this morning:

a total of 173,784 people have been tested, of whom 38,168 have tested positive
  3,605 people have sadly died
We are reminded again today that, for the NHS, this is truly the frontline. In the last 24 hours, 2 nurses and 2 healthcare assistants have tragically died fighting coronavirus. Every life lost to this dreadful disease makes me more determined than ever to push for victory.

Today, I want to update you with the latest on what we’re doing to boost NHS capacity, so the capacity we have to care is always above the need for that care.

First, we’re delivering more critical care beds. This morning, I attended the opening of the new Nightingale Hospital in East London, with Ruth and many others. It was planned, constructed and fully staffed in just 9 days. That is an outstanding achievement and I pay tribute to Ruth and all who have been involved in its construction.

It shows what’s possible when we come together as one team, in one national effort. I pay tribute to the extraordinary work of everyone. The NHS, the military, the construction industry who both donated supplies and of course their expertise, the engineers, the electricians, the plumbers, the caterers and others, all playing their part to build a place of hope and a place of healing. It was really inspiring to go and see the sheer scale of it and the teamwork going on there.

And lastly, I want to thank you. I want to thank everyone who is at home, because you are giving the NHS the time to expand so that it can save lives. By staying at home, you are saving lives.

We have more Nightingale hospitals planned on the way in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. And today we’ve announced that we will begin the work on 2 further Nightingale hospitals in Bristol and Harrogate. The Bristol Nightingale will have a capacity of up to 1,000 beds, and in Harrogate a capacity of up to 500.

The Nightingale hospitals are not the only expansion we’ve seen across the NHS. Since the start of this crisis, we’ve boosted the number of critical care beds to care for coronavirus by over 2,500 – that’s before the addition we’ll get from the Nightingale hospitals.

And the result of this extraordinary work is that, in every hospital in the country, we have managed to expand capacity and, as we stand today, over 2,000 critical care beds are free and available and are ready should they be needed, and that’s before the Nightingale hospitals come on stream.

And of course we are working round the clock to deliver essential deliveries of PPE across the whole NHS, social care, key public services, and in all 4 nations of the UK. Yesterday, more than 26 million PPE products were delivered to 281 different organisations, and I have agreed with the Northern Ireland Executive that we will immediately be providing more PPE to Northern Ireland to meet their needs. Over 5 million items, including goggles, aprons and masks.

Over 7,000 NHS staff have now been tested. And next, alongside testing, we’re intensively researching drugs and treatments. Right since the start of this crisis, we’ve been clear that all our plans are based on the best possible science. And that science gets better every day, but there is still a lot that we don’t know about how to treat and potentially prevent COVID-19.

So, research about treatments is absolutely central to our plan. The UK of course has a long tradition that we are very proud of, of being the best in the world in this sort of science and we are a world leader in clinical trials. We are putting this to use right now, bringing together some of the finest research minds in the country to design new trials and we are delivering them at record pace.

We’ve established 3 national clinical trials covering each major stage of the disease: primary care, hospital care and critical care for the most seriously ill. And, just like the Nightingale, one of these trials was in fact put together in just 9 days, which is breath-taking speed. These trials are looking at the effect of existing drugs and steroids, repurposed for treatment of COVID-19.

One of the trials – called ‘Recovery’, which deals in hospital care – is the largest of its kind in the world, with 926 patients enrolled. We’ve also set up an expert Therapeutics Task Force to search for and shortlist other candidate medicines for trials. And I’m advised on that work by my brilliant colleague Jonathan Van Tam the Deputy Chief Medical Officer – who is one of the finest research scientists of his generation, and Jonathan will say a bit more about this in a few minutes.

We need more patients to volunteer to be part of these trials, because the bigger the trials, the better the data, and the faster we can roll out the treatments if – and only if – it’s proven to work.

These treatments will help us as the science develops, but, for now, the only way to protect yourself and your family from this disease is to stay at home.

And of course, while this is a national effort to find these treatments, it’s also an international effort. In the same way that we have donated more money to the global search for a vaccine than any other country, so too we will lead the world in this science of treatments and whatever we learn, we will share, because we are all on the same side in this war.

Earlier today, I spoke to my counterparts in the G7 to co-ordinate our research efforts over this and other things. And whether it’s treatments, or equipment, or NHS capacity, we will strain every sinew. We will move whatever mountains need to be moved. We need everyone to keep playing their part, and that includes you. The only way to protect yourselves and others now is to stay at home.

And the one final thing I want to say is this. We are set for a warm weekend in some parts of the country, but the disease is still spreading, and we absolutely cannot afford to relax the social distancing measures that we have in place. We cannot relax our discipline now. If we do, people will die.

So, I end with the advice we all know. This advice is not a request. It is an instruction. Stay at home, protect lives, and then you will be doing your part.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-04-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-3-april-2020"

Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.

I’m joined by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Professor Jonathan Van Tam, and our national testing coordinator, Professor John Newton.

Today, I want to update you with the latest plans for our programme of test, track and trace and how we are going to use this massive testing capability that we’ve built to get R down and keep R down.

Before I do, I just want to remind you of what we are trying to achieve.

Our plan is to slow the spread and protect the NHS, so the NHS is always there for you and your family whenever you need it, whether for coronavirus or anything else as we lead the nation through this crisis.

Our goal is working.

The number of spare critical care beds in the NHS is 3,413.

On the latest figures:

there have been 1,291,000 tests for coronavirus, including 85,186 tests on Sunday, yesterday
  190,584 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 3,985
  13,258 people are in hospital with coronavirus
  and 28,734 people have died, an increase of 288
That figure is lower than at any point since the end of March. But, as with testing, these reported figures tend to be lower over the weekend so we do expect that number to rise.

And remember, this is not just a number but it is a constant, insistent reminder that we must go further and faster in our national effort in dealing with this virus.

Over the last month we have built a national testing infrastructure capable of over 100,000 tests a day. Today, the capacity stands at 108,000.

This means we are now in a position to start implementing the next part of our plan: track and trace.

The aim of test, track and trace is to hunt down and isolate the virus so it’s unable to reproduce. And, crucially, test, track and trace allows us to take a more targeted approach to lockdown while still safely containing the disease.

Creating this system is a huge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity. We’ve already taken Britain’s small but brilliant diagnostics industry and taken it to global scale. We’re building an army of human contact tracers who can man the phones, and find the contacts and support people. And, of course, we’re developing the contact tracing app, which can help us deliver test, track and trace on the mass scale that we need across the country.

The app, which takes full consideration of privacy and security, has already been tested in closed conditions at an RAF base. And, today, I can announce the next steps.

From tomorrow, we will begin to pilot test, track and trace on the Isle of Wight, starting with health professionals and rolling out this week to all citizens. I am grateful to the huge enthusiasm shown by islanders, who know that by participating in this pilot they are at the forefront of helping get Britain back on her feet.

Where the Isle of Wight goes, Britain follows.

The island has a single NHS Trust, one local authority with the responsibility for public health, a relatively low number of COVID cases and, because it’s an island, we can run this trial in proper scientifically controlled conditions, comparing the effect with what’s going on in the mainland before we roll it out to the rest of the country.

So here’s how it will work.

Last week, we put in place the testing capability on the island. From tonight, the contact tracing capability will go live. And then, tomorrow, NHS staff on the island will be able to download the app.

And, from Thursday, each one of the 80,000 households on the island will get a letter from the Chief Nurse with comprehensive information about the trial. Islanders will then be asked to install the app. Once you’ve installed the app, it will start logging the distance between your phone and other phones with an app nearby.

It’s been designed with a form of Bluetooth that conserves power so the app won’t drain your battery.

This log of proximity information will then be securely stored on your phone.

If you become unwell with COVID symptoms, you inform the NHS via the app. Other app users who you’ve had significant contact with in the last few days will then be sent an alert by the NHS, along with advice about what to do.

A test-ordering function will then be built in.

If you’re watching this and you live on the Isle of Wight, I have a simple message: please, download the app to protect the NHS and save lives. By downloading the app, you’re protecting your own health, the health of your loved ones and the health of your community.

I know the people of the Isle of Wight will embrace this with enthusiasm, because, by embracing test, track and trace, you will be saving lives.

The pilot is important to help make sure this app works as well as it possibly can alongside the contact tracing system. And with your help we will learn a lot, we will use it to make things better and we want to hear from you.

I want to stress – and this is really important – that this trial does not mean the end of social distancing on the Isle of Wight, or anywhere else for that matter. We will only change the social distancing rules once our 5 tests are met.

So, I’ll end with the instruction that we all know: please, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.

Or, if you live on the Isle of Wight: stay at home, install the app, protect the NHS and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-05-05,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-4-may-2020"
"113","Speech","UN Human Rights Council 44: UK's closing statement","Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon welcomes conclusions of the 44th Session of the UN Human Rights Council.","The 44th session of the Human Rights Council concluded on Friday 17 June, adopting important resolutions on Syria, Belarus, Eritrea, Discrimination against Women and Girls and other pressing issues.  I would like to extend my gratitude to the HRC President and Secretariat for their efforts and creativity that allowed the session to take place smoothly in a hybrid format.

As the international community works together to face the challenges presented by coronavirus (COVID-19), it is crucial that states continue to meet their human rights obligations and take steps to mitigate the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on women and girls, and the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of society, including refugees and members of ethnic, religious and belief minorities, and ensure that they are actively included in response and recovery efforts.

I welcome the Council’s adoption of the latest Syria resolution, which focuses on the regime’s continued practice of enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention.  Given the additional risks posed by coronavirus, the regime must release all those arbitrarily detained.

The resolution also highlights the latest report by the Commission of Inquiry, which found reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed during the military offensive in Idlib.  Russia and China’s reprehensible use of their vetoes at the Security Council to reduce cross-border aid access into Northern Syria will lead to further loss of life.  The resolution rightly demands that the regime and its allies allow urgent, unimpeded, humanitarian access to alleviate the continued suffering of millions of vulnerable Syrians.

The UK delivered a cross-regional joint statement on Hong Kong and Xinjiang on behalf of 28 countries.  It is important to bring these issues to the Human Rights Council, given China’s ongoing human rights violations in Xinjiang, and the unprecedented nature of China’s actions in Hong Kong.  As the Prime Minister has said, the imposition of legislation related to national security in Hong Kong is a clear and serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.  The statement also reiterated our shared concerns about Xinjiang, and encouraged the High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide regular information on both situations.  I am encouraged that the statement brought together a broad group of states to call on China to uphold its international commitments and human rights obligations.

I also welcome the adoption of the resolution on Eritrea. The UK supports the work of the Special Rapporteur, and I was pleased to see her mandate renewed for another year. I welcome Eritrea’s engagement over the past year, but encourage further efforts to make tangible progress on key areas, such as reform of national service, and the implementation of UPR recommendations.

The adoption of the resolution on Belarus ensures that the Belarusian government continues to be held to account for its failure to meet its human rights obligations.  I call for the release of those arbitrarily arrested and detained for exercising their right to freedom of expression and assembly as the country prepares for the Presidential election.  I also urge Belarus to allow the Special Rapporteur access as a concrete step towards increased international cooperation.

I am pleased that the UK co-sponsored the resolution on the elimination of Female Genital Mutilation. FGM is an extremely harmful practice, causing severe and lifelong physical, psychological and emotional harm to women and girls.  The UK is proud to be a leading donor in the effort to support and accelerate the Africa-led movement to end FGM. There is still much more to do and we will continue our work to support the global ambition to end FGM by 2030.

I am also pleased that the UK co-sponsored the resolution on Elimination of Discrimination against Women and Girls.  I welcome its recognition of the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on women and girls.  We must work together to eliminate discrimination and gender-based violence, and ensure that women’s rights, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights, are central to the global recovery.

I am pleased that all the amendments that sought to weaken the text failed;  it is encouraging to see the international community defend language on women’s rights.  The UK firmly supports the sexual and reproductive health and rights of all women and girls.  Women and girls’ control over their own lives and bodies is fundamental to gender equality, and we will continue to work with others to protect this.

I welcome the adoption of the resolution on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, which the UK was pleased to cosponsor.  Freedom of opinion and expression are essential in any functioning democracy;  people must be allowed to discuss and debate issues freely, and to challenge their governments.  During the session we highlighted our concern about the recent ruling in the case of the journalist Maria Ressa in the Philippines.

The Human Rights Council continues to play an essential role in holding to account those who violate or abuse human rights, particularly now, as the coronavirus pandemic brings unprecedented humanitarian challenges and disruption to economies and societies, and has a negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights around the world.  As we seek election to the Council later this year, the UK remains strongly committed to supporting the Council and the wider international community in championing human rights.","Foreign & Commonwealth Office and Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon",2020-07-23,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/un-human-rights-council-44-uks-closing-statement"

Good afternoon and welcome to this No10 press conference on our progress in the fight against COVID 19.

I am joined today by Professor Steve Powis, the National Medical Director at NHS England.

In a moment or two I will hand over to Steve to take us through the slide updates from the Cabinet Office briefing room.

But first I want to set out the latest coronavirus data.

1,206,405 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 76,496 yesterday.

Overall, 186,599 people have tested positive. That’s an increase of 4,339 cases since yesterday.

14,248 people are currently being treated in hospital for coronavirus, compared to 14,695 yesterday.

Sadly, of those who have tested positive for coronavirus across all settings, 28,446 have died.

Behind the numbers there has been an increase of 315 deaths since yesterday across all settings.

This pandemic has claimed more than 28,000 lives, and each one of them is precious, each one valued, each one irreplaceable.

The pain of bereavement and heartbreak is deeply personal.

But as a society, we are showing care and compassion across boundaries, offering support and a chance to talk through grief together.

For those experiencing the first Ramadan without a loved one, this will be a particularly painful time. I send my sincere condolences to all families who are grieving.

As with Christians who could not celebrate Easter together in church, and the Jewish community whose Passover rituals were affected by social distancing, our thoughts are with Muslim neighbours who cannot break their fast together and must adapt their religious and cultural practices because of the crisis.

We have all learned to adapt, and we must carry on doing so after the Prime Minister sets out how we will get back to work later this week. His comprehensive plan will explain how we can get our economy moving, how we can get our children back to school, how we can travel to work more safely and how we can make life in the workplace safer.

But before we can ease the existing restrictions we must ensure the government’s five tests are met – that the number of cases are falling, that death rates are declining, that the NHS has what it needs and that measures are in place to stop a second peak overwhelming the NHS.

I am particularly conscious that those in the frontline of our public services will need clear guidance on safe working, they’ll need the right personal protective equipment and appropriate access to testing if we are to make all the progress that we want in the weeks ahead.

We are consulting with employers and unions, professionals and public health experts, to establish how we can ensure that we have the safest possible working environments and the Prime Minister will be saying more later next week.

On personal protective equipment for key workers, we are increasing the spread of distribution and supply.

From February 25 to May 2 we have delivered over 1.08 billion items of PPE across the health and social care system within England – and tens of millions more have been distributed by our colleagues in the Devolved Administrations.

This overall figure includes:

149 million masks
  173 million aprons
  2 million gowns
  614 million gloves
On 2 May alone, we delivered an additional 20 million items of PPE within England.

But there is much more to do and the work led by Lord Deighton to improve domestic production of PPE is vital to our efforts.

And on testing, thanks to the hard work of so many across the NHS, Public Health England, our pharmaceutical sector and our universities, we have tested over 200,000 key workers and their families, allowing those who don’t have the virus to go back to work, and protecting those who do.

We have now, of course, extended the criteria for testing beyond key workers to anyone over 65 displaying symptoms, and anyone who has to travel to get to work.

And this week we will be piloting new test, track and trace procedures on the Isle of Wight with a view to having them in place more widely later this month.

All of these steps will help us to get more people back to work and help to support the delivery of our public services.

And I want to thank those who have done so much to maintain the provision of critical public services during this crisis.

Our teachers have worked incredibly hard to provide educational support to millions.

And the government has committed £100m to boost remote learning for those who need it most. Our newly-launched Oak National Academy is supplementing all the work going on by schools and teachers by providing 180 video lessons each week.

We are particularly keen to help vulnerable and disadvantaged children carry on with their education during the pandemic. Schools continue to receive additional funding in the form of the pupil premium, for those pupils who most deserve it – worth around £2.4 billion annually.

We have ordered laptops to help disadvantaged young people who will be sitting key exams next year. We are also providing laptops and tablets for those children with social workers and care leavers, to help them stay in touch with the services they need, keeping them safe and supporting home learning.

And if disadvantaged secondary school pupils and care leavers who are preparing for exams do not have internet access, we will provide free routers to get them connected while schools are closed.

Over the Easter holidays, we were able to ensure that more than 60 percent of schools were open every day, with places for both vulnerable children and those of critical workers.

And the Free School Meal Voucher Scheme ensured that children who needed it can continue to access food despite school closures. So far, 15,500 schools have placed orders for vouchers, of which over £35 million has been redeemed.

The latest available data shows that around 49,000 of the children in attendance on April 24 were classed by schools as vulnerable – more than double the figure from a week earlier.

While this is going in the right direction, we estimate this still represents only around one in ten of all children and young people classified as vulnerable. We want to see this figure go up further, and we’re working with local authorities, schools and colleges to provide improved support to vulnerable young people.

Support for local authorities/military

All this additional support of course takes time, puts pressure on existing staff and costs money.

That is why we have pledged an additional £1.6bn to councils across England to support their essential frontline services including adult social care. This sum takes the funding given to councils to over £3.2billion, to help communities through the crisis.

We have also deployed military support to assist the public sector. The Covid Support Force mobilised by the MoD is now 20,000-strong.

Today, over 3,600 personnel are deployed in support of 86 separate projects in which military aid is being given to civil authorities.

On a national level, they are helping the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the Department of Health and Social Care and also the NHS, with planning and logistics in England, Scotland and Wales.

On the ground, they are helping to build and to staff temporary Nightingale hospitals, and to operate both Regional Testing Centres for coronavirus, of which there are now 49 around the country. And also the Mobile Testing Units that we are rolling out: to date there are 77 of them.

Across the country, 156 military planners are embedded at grass-roots level with our existing Local Resilience Forums – partnerships of emergency services, local authorities, the NHS, the Environment Agency and others. They are helping to coordinate and protect our vital local services and supplies, with the additional support of senior Whitehall officials.

In addition, we have to thank local government for their energetic work, because since the end of March, 90 percent of rough sleepers known to councils have been made an offer of accommodation, reassuring them about their safety.

The government, more widely, is also working hard to support those who have not been identified as ‘shielded’ but are still vulnerable. In the coming days, we will be delivering our one millionth parcel of essential food to those at highest risk across the country.

Up to 200,000 telephone calls a day are being made to the shielded, and councils are helping to support them in other ways - including organising regular calls from volunteers to those who are isolated.

In our communities, the support put in place by many local organisations has been inspirational as people step up to help friends and neighbours.

The government has helped to mobilise another important lifeline through the NHS Volunteers Responders programme.

Over 600,000 people have had their ID verified and are helping with the daily errands that make such a significant difference - collecting shopping, making contact as a human voice on the end of a telephone, transporting patients and supplies for the NHS.

And, of course, we are all working with supermarkets to ensure that a greater number of online delivery slots are made available to those most in need.

Importance of working as a team across the UK

In every one of these areas, the government in Westminster has been working with ministers from the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Executive. This has helped us to monitor and react to the path of the virus across the nations, enabling us to intervene wherever people are in need.

At each of these daily press conferences, we have paid tribute to the compassion and dedication of our key public-sector workers.

I recognise how much we all owe to their stoicism and steadfastness. Nurses, doctors, porters, cleaners, paramedics, pharmacists, care home staff, prison and police officers, teachers, social workers, those preparing and delivering food, collecting our refuse and administering our welfare system. They deserve our gratitude, they deserve our support, they are in all our minds. They are the very best of us.

We owe them so much – and we in government will do everything we can to support them during the next phases of our pandemic response.

I will now hand over to Professor Steve Powis to take us through the latest developments on the pandemic.","Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP",2020-05-14,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-duchy-of-lancasters-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-3-may"
"115","Speech","Mapping recovery through environmental sustainability","Statement by Lord Goldsmith at WWF Side Event at the 2020 High-Level Political Forum on the Sustainable Development Goals","Thank you very much. It’s an honour to be joining you all today, and it’s a particular honour to follow Honourable Pamela Castillo from Costa Rica, which is one of the great environmental examples of the world, doing extraordinary work on many levels. I hope everyone is safe and well in these difficult times.

First thing I wanted to say is an obvious thing to say, and that is that COVID-19 and the effects of this pandemic are going to be felt for many, many years to come. It has brutally exposed our vulnerabilities and it is – or it should be, at least – a wake up call.

In the narrow sense, we have already known for a very long time that the majority of new infections and diseases, many of them household name diseases, are zoonotic. So we know that link exists, and yet we’ve done very little to either reduce or mitigate that risk over the years. But the wake up call goes much, much wider than that. It goes wider than pandemics or zoonosis. The crisis is itself a symptom of our dysfunctional relationship with the natural world. And terrible though the experience has been for many, many families around the world, the truth is that the effects will be dwarfed by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation unless we act very quickly and decisively.

And the news is relentless and stark; around a million species now face extinction, many of them within decades. Every minute we’re told the world loses approximately 30 football pitches with the forests and our oceans no better - warmer, more acidic, increasingly polluted, choked up with plastic. Only this month, the IUCN warned that species from North Atlantic Right Whales to African Primates are fading under the pressure that they’re under.

And it is an ecological tragedy, but it is also a human disaster as well: locusts, drought, lethal temperatures, cyclones, dwindling fish stocks, disease and so on.

For the first time in its 15 year history, environmental risks filled the top five places of the World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report. And the IPCC, the IPBES, the Global Commission on Adaptation, Professor Desgupta’s review, they all tell the same somber story. We are undermining our very foundations and it makes as little sense ecologically as it does economically because it really shouldn’t need saying but it sometimes does: we depend, all of us, completely on the world around us. Over a billion people, for example, depend on forests for their livelihoods directly. Ultimately, of course, we all depend on it. And yet their value barely registers. The Amazon, for instance, today is worth more dead than it is alive. And the financial incentives that destroy forests outstripped those in favour of their conservation and protection by around 40 to one - possibly much more.

COVID-19 therefore gives us an opportunity, I think, to begin to correct that imbalance. As co-host of the next Climate COP, the UK is going to encourage countries to move beyond treating climate change and environmental degradation as just one of many tasks facing government – or even worse, putting that task to one side as we frantically tried to crank up our economies postcode. We instead need to inextricably combine, tackling this existential crisis with the need to rebuild following coronavirus. Because if we get this right, our recovery from the crisis could transform our cities. It could reconcile our economies with nature. It could bring us closer to living within nature’s means. The transition to net zero, I think, could be one of the great stories of the 21st century. Countries are already designing their economic recovery packages. So far governments around the world have committed around $9 trillion to COVID recovery. And how they choose to spend those funds will have ramifications for decades. We can stick with the status quo of bailing out high carbon, environmentally damaging industries and locking in decades of environmental destruction, carbon emissions, or we can choose to make environmental sustainability and resilience the lens through which we map out our recovery. And I’m delighted, you won’t be surprised to hear that our own Prime Minister is committed to build back better, build back greener.

The second point that I wanted to make is that it makes no sense for us to treat climate change and environmental degradation as separate issues. You cannot tackle one without also tackling the other. And an obvious example is forests. In addition to providing livelihoods for over a billion people and a home to some 80 percent of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity, deforestation is the second biggest source of emissions. Now we’re told that nature-based solutions could provide up to a third of the cost effective climate change mitigation that we need over the next decade, while also helping communities adapt to become more resilient. In truth, it’s probably a lot more than a third. But despite that huge contribution, nature-based solutions currently attract a measly three percent, just marginally less than three percent of global climate funding. And that makes no sense whatsoever. So as COP hosts, our focus, of course, will be on clean energy, zero emissions vehicles, finance, adaptation and resilience but at its core will be a major emphasis on nature.

At home, we are already switching our agricultural subsidies away from rewarding destruction towards a system of public money in return for public goods like environmental stewardship. We’ve established a new £640 million Nature for Climate Fund to help protect and restore our forests and peatlands. We’ve doubled our international climate finance to £11.6 billion and we’re going to be spending a significant part of the uplift on nature. And we’re going to be asking other countries to do the same. 

But the cost of renewing and protecting nature is vastly more than public money can provide and we know that. Just as for carbon, we need to attach a value to nature recovery and a cost to its destruction. I know the Seychelles have led the way on Blue Bonds, for example. 
We need to tackle those perverse incentives. Consider, for example, that agriculture causes around 80 percent of natural ecosystem conversion, including deforestation and yet the top 50 fruit producing countries in the world spend around $700 billion a year in support for often destructive land use. Imagine the impact if global support shifted in favour of sustainability, as we are doing here in the UK. That’s over four times the budget of all the world’s aid agencies combined. It would be huge.

Equally, we’re determined to address the fact that our ecological footprint here in the UK extends vastly beyond our shores. The commodities we import alone come with devastating levels of deforestation. So we will clean up our own supply chains and work directly with other countries, consumer and producer countries, to deliver change internationally. I note that China is committed to taking steps to exclude illegal forest products from its own gigantic supply chains. So I encourage them to really pursue that course of action. If we get it right we can protect forests and livelihoods and consumer and producer countries around the world. I’m convinced that the UK can make a meaningful difference, perhaps even turn the tide as hosts of COP26 in 2021. With nature as a core priority, clearly we’re going to be working very closely with the Chinese as hosts the CBD. 

We’re using this extended run-up that we now have as a consequence of coronavirus to build a critical mass of countries willing to go much further on setting ambitious targets to protect land and sea, to clean our supply chains, to tackle marine plastic, to transform land use subsidies to reach net zero emissions, and to dramatically increase support for nature-based solutions. It’s wonderful, incidentally, to have Belize, the Seychelles and Costa Rica in our Global Ocean Alliance to protect at least 30 percent of the ocean by 2030. Please do encourage your colleagues and friends from other countries to sign up as well.

This is the moment, I think, for a seismic shift. As every nation renews and rebuilds, as we all must, we can turn this experience to the good by making environmental sustainability and resilience the lens through which we map out our recovery. We can and we must now reset our relationship with this, the only planet that can sustain us. We have all the tools we need. We need to start using them.

Opening remarks

Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.

I’m pleased to be joined today by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam.

Latest data

Let me start by updating you on the latest information from the COBR data file.

I can report that through the government’s monitoring and testing programme, as of today…..

1, 728,443 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 96, 878 tests yesterday
  215,260 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,896 cases since yesterday
  11,809 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down from 12,284 yesterday
And tragically, of those hospitalised with the virus, 31,587 have now died. That’s an increase of 346 fatalities since yesterday.

These deaths are devastating for the families and friends of victims, who are in our thoughts and prayers are with all of them every day.

But they also strengthen our resolve to fight this pandemic with all the resources we can muster in the weeks ahead….

Planning for restart/opportunity for lasting change

Tomorrow, the Prime Minister will set out a roadmap for the next phase in our strategy to tackle coronavirus.

In support of this, I am setting out today an ambitious programme to help prepare our transport network for the critical role it will play as we emerge from this crisis.

Importantly, it is true to say that moving beyond COVID will be a gradual process… not a single-leap to freedom.

When we do emerge, the world will seem quite different, at least for a while.

The need to maintain social distancing means that our public transport system cannot go back to where it left off.

Here is a very stark fact…

Even with public transport reverting to full service - once you take into account the 2 metre social distancing rule – there would only be effective capacity for one in ten passengers on many parts of the network.

Just a tenth of the old capacity.

So, getting Britain moving again, while not overcrowding our transport network, is going to require many of us to think carefully about how and when we travel.

Everyone involved

We have accomplished so much over the past 7 weeks of lockdown.

The whole country has been responsible for reducing the COVID reproduction or ‘R’ rate…

Millions of households across the UK have changed their behaviour for the greater good.

Getting Britain moving again, whilst not overcrowding our transport network, represents another enormous logistical challenge.

Yet this is a problem which presents a health opportunity too…. an opportunity to make lasting changes that could not only make us fitter, but also better-off – both mentally and physically – in the long run.

Active travel

During the crisis, millions of people have discovered the benefits of active travel.

By cycling or walking, we’ve been able to enjoy this remarkably warm spring whilst sticking to the guidelines.

In some places, there’s been a 70% rise in the number of people on bikes whether it’s for exercise, or necessary journeys, such as stocking up on food.

So, while it’s still crucial that we stay at home,  when the country does get back to work, we need those people to carry on cycling and walking, and to be joined by many more.

Otherwise, with public transport capacity severely restricted, more cars could be drawn to the road and our towns and cities could become gridlocked.

We also know that in this new world, pedestrians will need more space.

So today (9 May 2020) I am announcing a £2 billion package to put cycling and walking at the heart of our transport policy.

To set out how we will deliver this, I will bring forward a national cycling plan for publication in early June, in line with the statutory Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy to help double cycling and increase walking by 2025.

The first stage, worth £250 million, is a series of swift, emergency interventions to make cycling and walking safer.

Pop-up bike lanes. Wider pavements. Cycle and bus-only streets. All examples of what people will start to see more of.

Accompanying the new money, we are today publishing fast-tracked statutory guidance, effective immediately, requiring councils in England to cater for significantly-increased numbers of cyclists and pedestrians, and making it easier for them to create safer streets.

For employees who want to start cycling to their place of work, but who don’t have a bike right now, the popular Cycle to Work Scheme already allows employees to save between 25% and 39% on the cost of a new bike or an electric bike.

There has been a huge increase in people using the scheme,  and we will work with employers to increase uptake further.

And for those who may have an old bike in the shed, and want to get it back into a roadworthy condition, there will be a voucher scheme for bike repairs and maintenance.

Plans are also being developed to boost bike fixing facilities.

What’s more, over the next few months, we will set out further measures to make a ‘once in a generation’ change to the way people travel in Britain.

These will include tough new standards for cycling infrastructure;

a new national cycling champion to inspire us
  much closer links with the NHS, with GPs prescribing cycling to help us get fitter
  legal changes to protect vulnerable road users
  at least one “zero-emission city,” with its centre restricted to bikes and electric vehicles
  and the creation of a long-term cycling programme and budget, just like we have for our roads
There’s clear evidence, including from the Prime Minister’s time as mayor of London, that making streets safe for walking and cycling is good for retailers, business and the economy.

Green travel / E-scooters / E-vehicles

And in making these changes, our national recovery can also become a green recovery.

One of the few positive benefits about the crisis is drastically better air quality and the health benefits that that brings.

More than 20,000 extra deaths a year in the UK are attributed to nitrogen dioxide emissions, which are highest in areas with most road traffic.

We want to try to preserve this as much as possible.

So today I’m also fast-tracking trials of e-scooters, bringing this programme, already underway, forward from next year, to next month….

And extending those trials from four local authorities to every region in the country that wants them….

… in a bid to get e-scooter rental schemes up-and-running in our cities as fast as possible….

Helping reduce car use on shorter journeys, and taking some pressure off buses, at this vital time.

These trials will help us assess their safety and benefits, together with their impact on public spaces.

The car industry has of course been very badly hit during this crisis, but April’s new sales figures showed – for the first time – that the two biggest selling models were both electric vehicles.

So, to help keep this quiet, clean car revolution going, I can also announce today, £10 million of additional support for car-charging points on our streets.

The car will remain the mainstay for many families and, as well as backing electric infrastructure, we’re going to accelerate the filling of pot-holes that plague so many road users.

Data

And just as new technology is changing the vehicles we use, so new digital technologies will help us make more informed transport choices in our battle against Covid.

At a time when transport demand could quickly overwhelm capacity if users have no access to real-time travel information…

… It is crucial that we take advantage of the UK’s digital tech expertise.

With the right mobile apps, people can find out which parts of the transport network are overcrowded. And avoid them!

They can choose alternative travel options, to help maintain safe social distancing…

… or they can get information to help stagger their journeys - and lift the burden on public transport at peak times.

This week I chaired a roundtable with key players like Google, Microsoft, and British firm, Citymapper, to develop both data and apps to help the public view crowding across the transport network, in real-time.

Overall package

This £2 billion announcement represents the most significant package of cycling, walking and green travel by any British government.

Clearly, it will never be possible to cycle, walk or e-scooter everywhere. Cars will remain an absolutely vital form of transport for many….

And so in the coming days…

as we look to the future…

… there will be further announcements about the huge investment we’re making in road and rail networks – taking advantage of their low usership during this COVID crisis.

Closing remarks

Finally, as we begin the process of preparing public transport to get Britain moving again, no-one should underestimate the sheer scale of the challenge ahead.

Even with every train, bus and tram fully restored to service – this will not be enough.

Social distancing measures mean that everyone who travels will need to contribute to meeting this capacity challenge.

Changing our behaviour is the single biggest thing that’s beaten back this virus.

The welcome fall we’ve seen in deaths is not only the achievement of our doctors and nurses and careworkers - but of everyone in the country for following the stay at home guidance.

To re-iterate, nothing I have said today changes these basic rules.

But as we contemplate the future, we will have to carry on making changes, particularly after we leave our homes.

Preventing overcrowding – which could lead to a second spike and more deaths – will be the responsibility of each and every one of us.

So please, only travel when you need to.

Be considerate to others, and help us prioritise essential workers.

And let’s all play our part in Britain moving safely again when that time comes.","Department for Transport and The Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP",2020-05-09,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/transport-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-9-may-2020"
"117","Speech","UK Statement to the WTO Council for Trade in Goods – Item 9","The UK's Ambassador to the WTO and UN in Geneva, Julian Braithwaite, delivered this statement at a meeting of the WTO’s Council for Trade in Goods on 10 June 2020.","UNITED KINGDOM – DRAFT GOODS SCHEDULE AND PROPOSED UK TRQ COMMITMENTS: SYSTEMIC CONCERNS – REQUEST FROM AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, NEW ZEALAND, THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, SWITZERLAND, THE UNITED STATES, AND URUGUAY

Thank you, Chair.

I want to thank Members for their statements under this item.

As Members will be aware, on 1 February 2020 the United Kingdom circulated document WT/GC/206, which sets out the main implications arising from the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union in the WTO.

The United Kingdom has undertaken its transition in the WTO with the aim of maintaining the existing balance of rights and obligations between the United Kingdom and its trading partners. The United Kingdom has set out its Goods Schedule, circulated in document G/MA/TAR/RS/570, on that basis.

The United Kingdom has engaged extensively with Members on that Schedule, and we remain open to discussions to ensure that conditions remain no less favourable to trade after the end of the Transition Period agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which will end on 31 December 2020.

Recognising that, the United Kingdom is currently undergoing a process under Article XXVIII to seek agreement with relevant WTO Members on how to extract the United Kingdom’s TRQ commitments from those of the EU28.

The United Kingdom’s last round of Article XXVIII negotiations took place in February 2020 in Geneva, and we hope to have the next round of negotiations in July.

On AMS, we note some Members asked about whether the European Union’s AMS will reduce proportionally in line with the commitment set out in the UK’s Schedule XIX. The United Kingdom cannot comment on the European Union’s ongoing processes. However, we would recall that it was clear in the joint UK-EU letter of 11 October 2017 that the final bound commitment level for domestic agricultural support would be apportioned between the EU and the UK. This was also restated in the explanatory note to the United Kingdom’s Goods Schedule in document G/MA/TAR/RS/570, and is a clear commitment. We would also remind members that this explanatory note contains details on how the AMS apportionment was calculated.

Turning to other points raised: As some Members will be aware, the United Kingdom announced the ‘UK Global Tariff’ on 19 May 2020. This is the applied Most Favoured Nation tariff regime that the United Kingdom will apply from 1 January 2021, following the end of the Transition Period, and it will be expressed in the United Kingdom’s national currency.

As a consequence of this change, and to ensure stability and transparency between the UK’s bound and applied Schedules, the United Kingdom has circulated document G/MA/TAR/RS/570/Add.1, rectifying its bound goods Schedule to redenominate all currency components in Part I and Part IV – Section I of the Schedule from Euros to pound Sterling. This brings the United Kingdom into line with most other WTO Members, who denominate their schedules in their own currency. In order to provide Members with complete transparency on the steps we are taking to effect this currency conversion, the UK introduced this matter as a standalone technical rectification of Schedule XIX with no additional changes being made at this time. This currency rectification process has been submitted without prejudice to already ongoing discussions on the broader certification of Schedule XIX.

The United Kingdom looks forward to continuing engagement with members on these important issues

Thank you.","Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Department for International Trade, and Julian Braithwaite",2020-06-11,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-statement-to-the-wto-council-for-trade-in-goods-item-9"
"118","Speech","UN Human Rights Council 45: Interactive Dialogue with the Fact Finding mission on Venezuela","UK's International Ambassador for Human Rights, Rita French's statement during the Interactive Dialogue with the Fact Finding mission on Venezuela.","Thank you, Madam President.

We welcome the High Commissioner’s recent update on the human rights situation in Venezuela and thank her for her work.  We commend the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission (IFFM) for its report and support a renewal of its mandate.

The IFFM’s report concerns us greatly.  It describes extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture.  The IFFM reports that it has reasonable grounds to believe that senior figures in the Venezuelan regime ordered or contributed to the commission of crimes it documents.  Such gross human rights violations are completely unacceptable.

The political, human rights and humanitarian situation has continued to deteriorate and the rule of law has been further weakened. At a time when the COVID pandemic and its consequences demand urgent attention, the regime in Venezuela is continuing its attacks on the political opposition; stifling media freedom; and threatening and intimidating journalists, human rights defenders and many others. We welcome the recent release of some political prisoners and urge that all those still held be released immediately and unconditionally.

We urge and expect Venezuela to promote and protect human rights, to prevent further serious abuses, and to comply fully with its obligations as an HRC  member.

We welcome the High Commissioner’s update on the impact of the pandemic on human rights.  As this Council stressed in its Presidential statement, States must ensure that human rights are respected in their response to the pandemic.

We are concerned by the reports of clampdowns on freedom of expression, by allegations of people being arrested for criticising the government’s response, accused of disinformation or even terrorism; of doctors being silenced; of access to information denied; of human rights defenders and journalists arbitrarily detained; of online civic space – more crucial than ever – being unduly restricted; and by some countries using the pandemic as an excuse to roll back women’s rights and discriminate against LGBT citizens.

We are concerned too by the disproportionate impact the crisis is having on the most disadvantaged and vulnerable - leaving them even further behind; by its impact on women and girls; and by the increase in domestic violence.

All actors have a role to play so that we can build back better. Global collaboration and resourcing is essential for the necessary vaccines, treatments and tests. The UK, through our newly merged Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, has pledged £774 million to support the global effort. We are proud that, with the UN Secretary-General, the WHO and Republic of South Africa, we will co-host a high level event at UNGA on 30 September to accelerate multilateral activity, particularly the COVAX Vaccines Facility.

High Commissioner, how can we fully involve all actors and stakeholders in the response and recovery, to build back better?","Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and Rita French",2020-09-15,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/un-human-rights-council-45-statement-for-the-interactive-dialogue-on-covid-19"

Good afternoon.

I am joined today by Professor Steve Powis who is National Medical Director of NHS England.

I will shortly be setting out our progress on vaccines but first, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.

2,580,769 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 91,206 tests carried out yesterday.

243,303 people have tested positive. That’s an increase of 3,142 cases since yesterday.

Unfortunately, due to technical issues, Northern Ireland have been unable to process any testing data for Pillar 1 today. Today’s daily totals therefore reflect Pillar 1 data for Great Britain only, excluding Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland are looking to resolve this issue as soon as possible and we will update the data when we can.

10,035 people are in hospital with COVID-19, down (15%) from 11,817 this time last week.

And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 34,636 have now died. That’s an increase of 170 fatalities since yesterday.

Our thoughts are very much with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.

Before talking about the work on vaccines and taking questions, I just want to remind everyone of the details of the next phase of our fight against coronavirus.

First, in order to monitor our progress, we have established a new COVID Alert Level System, with 5 levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus.

The alert level is based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.

And in turn, that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place.

The lower the level, the fewer the measures.

The higher the level, the stricter the measures.

Throughout the period of lockdown, which started on March 23, we have been at Level 4.

Thanks to you, people across the country, we have collectively helped to bring the R level down.

And we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in careful steps.

We have set out the first of 3 steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life.

But crucially, whilst avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS.

After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data.

And we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.

As the Prime Minister announced this week, as part of the first step:


    those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work
  
  
    you can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like
  
  
    you can meet 1 person outside of your household in an outdoor public place, provided you stay 2 metres apart
  
Having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated what we are asking people to do.

Which is to: Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives.

Staying Alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible.

But there are a range of other actions we are advising people to take.

People should Stay Alert, by:


    working from home if you can
  
  
    limiting contact with other people
  
  
    keeping distance if you go out - 2 metres apart where possible
  
  
    washing your hands regularly
  
  
    wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant, for example in some shops and on public transport
  
  
    and, if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate
  
Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections.

This is how we can continue to save lives as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.

But in order to definitively conquer this disease, we need to find a safe, workable vaccine.

Last month I announced a new Vaccine Taskforce to coordinate the efforts of government, academia and industry in the critical mission to find a vaccine.

I am very proud of how quickly our scientists and researchers have come together in their efforts to develop a vaccine that will combat coronavirus.

Their work has meant that 2 of the world’s front-runners to develop a vaccine are right here in the UK – at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.

The first clinical trial of the Oxford vaccine is progressing well, with all Phase 1 participants having received their vaccine dose on schedule earlier this week.

They are now being monitored closely by the clinical trial team.

The speed at which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented.

Imperial College are also making good progress, and will be looking to move into clinical trials by mid-June, with larger scale trials planned to begin in October.

So far the government has invested £47 million in the Oxford and Imperial vaccine programmes.

But today I can announce an additional £84 million of new government funding to help accelerate their work.

This new money will help mass produce the Oxford vaccine, so that if current clinical trials are successful, we have dosages to start vaccinating the UK population straight away.

The funding will also allow Imperial to launch phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine later this year.

I can also confirm that with government support, Oxford University has finalised a global licensing agreement with AstraZeneca for the commercialisation and manufacturing of the Oxford vaccine.

This means that, if the vaccine is successful, Astra Zeneca will work to make up to 30 million doses available by September for the UK, as part of an agreement to deliver 100 million doses in total.

The UK will be the first to get access.

And we can also ensure that, in addition to supporting people here in the UK, we are able to make the vaccine available to developing countries at the lowest possible cost.

To further support our domestic manufacturing capability, last month I announced that the government will accelerate building the UK’s first Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre, which is based at Harwell in Oxfordshire.

And today I can announce that we will invest up to a further £93 million in the Centre, ensuring that it opens in summer 2021 - a full 12 months ahead of schedule.

The Centre – which is already under construction - will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as 6 months.

But if, and it is a big “if”, a successful vaccine is available later this year, we will need to be in a position to manufacture it at scale – and quickly.

So while the Centre is being built, the government will establish a rapid deployment facility thanks to a further investment of £38 million to begin coronavirus vaccine manufacturing at scale from this summer.

This facility will support efforts to ensure a vaccine is widely available to the UK public as soon as possible.

In total, the government has now committed over a quarter of a billion pounds towards developing a vaccine in the UK.

But there are no certainties.

In spite of the tireless effort of our scientists, it is possible that we may never find a successful coronavirus vaccine.

So we also need to look at other drug treatments and therapeutics for those who get the virus.

Treatments that could prevent people progressing to severe illness, or help save lives of those with serious symptoms.

While there are currently no drugs in the world have been clinically proven to treat coronavirus, the government is working with our scientists and medical experts to identify promising candidates.

This collaborative UK programme, known as the ACCORD (Accelerating COVID-19 Research & Development platform), aims to get an early indication of drug treatments’ effectiveness in treating coronavirus.

And today I can report that 6 drugs have now entered initial live clinical trials.

If positive results are seen, they will advance into larger scale trials.

Our scientists are working tirelessly to develop vaccines and drug treatments.

Condensing work which would usually take years, into months and even weeks.

Their drive and dedication inspires us all.

And with their help, we will overcome coronavirus.

Thank you very much for that kind introduction.

It’s a pleasure to be addressing you virtually today at the Housing 2020 Festival.

…And I’d like to thank the Chartered Institute of Housing for bringing together such a diverse group of leaders from across local government and the housing industry during these truly unprecedented times.

COVID-19 has challenged our society, our economy and our country in so many different ways.

But the British people have also shown incredible resilience and bravery….

…From the doctors, nurses and NHS staff who have worked selflessly since the start of this pandemic to our carers, teachers, and frontline workers in local government protecting the most vulnerable in our communities.

I also want to recognise everything that housing associations and social landlords have done to continue to meet their residents’ needs in the challenging circumstances of the past few months – not least in delivering vital support to vulnerable people.

Businesses from across the country, supported by a £160 billion fiscal response from government, have also risen to the enormous challenges before them.

That includes the construction sector who answered the government’s call in March to manufacture more ventilators as well as the wider house-building industry who have played a critical role in helping the country embrace the ‘new normal’ as we shift from response to recovery together.

The local lockdowns we’ve seen in Leicester, Preston and Manchester underscore our collective need to stay alert and remain vigilant over the coming weeks and months, especially as winter approaches.

And as a government, we will continue to stand by the vulnerable and those who have been hard-hit financially and personally by this pandemic.

Homelessness and evictions ban

Nearly 15,000 vulnerable people, including rough sleepers and the homeless, were housed in emergency accommodation at the start of this pandemic.

And we are building on these achievements through funding longer-term accommodation – 3,300 homes this year alone – along with tailored support so as few people as possible return to life on the streets.

Last month, we also announced additional protections for renters with a further stay on all housing possession proceedings in court.

That means that no action to progress new or existing claims for possession can be progressed for several weeks. 

Thanks to new legislation we brought forward in August, landlords are also required to give 6 months’ notice to evict any tenant (private or social) – up from the 3 months required by the original provisions in the Coronavirus Act – except in the most serious of cases.

We also recognise that there are some occasions in which it is right that landlords should be able to start progressing cases quicker.

Through working with the Master of the Rolls’ working group, we’ve identified these types of cases which present the most strain for landlords.

Notice periods for the most serious circumstances, including notices in relation to anti-social behaviour and where over 6 months of rent is due, have therefore been reduced.

We are also working closely with the judiciary, legal representatives and the advisory sector to help courts offer appropriate protection for all parties once the stay on possession proceedings ends.

And we remain committed, once the urgencies of responding to this pandemic have passed, to bring forward legislation which would abolish Section 21 evictions altogether.

Our measures will ensure that struggling households in both the private and social rented sector are not forced from their homes as we head into winter, keeping them safe and preventing extra burden falling on the NHS….

Because we cannot be complacent about the scale of the challenge ahead of us in this national recovery.

And it’s right that we help families, communities and businesses to continue adapting to the ‘new normal’ and the realities of COVID-19…

But I also believe that we should fully utilise the coming weeks and months as a window of opportunity to lay the foundations for long-term economic growth while also building the homes this country needs.

Planning for the future white paper

For our part, we are fulfilling our promise to ‘build, build, build’ through a complete overhaul of our outdated and antiquated planning system.

As many of you know, last month my department announced radical new proposals for the country’s planning system, so that building homes is quicker, easier and more affordable than ever before.

Our Planning for the future white paper will reduce the burdens on small builders through simplifying the planning process and reducing its associated risks, delays and costs.

We are also rapidly accelerating the planning process by going digital and introducing a new system for local plans based on maps and data – not the 500-page, inaccessible planning documents of old.

I am keen to continue working closely with local authorities and the wider housing sector to make sure our proposed reforms work for everyone and that we get this right.

However, today, I want to directly address 3 myths that have surfaced in response to our planning reforms.

The first is the ill-founded criticism that our changes will diminish local decision-making.

Actually, our reforms will ensure consultation with local communities from the very beginning of the planning process.

Land will be designated into 1 of 3 categories – for growth, for renewal or for protection.

I want to be clear – local communities will play a central role in deciding the future of their areas, helping plan where development should go, what standard it should be and what it should look and feel like.

Far from removing communities from the planning process, these reforms inject greater democratic involvement into the system.

We want communities to have their say on setting the plan, rather than reacting to individual applications too late in the process.

This clarity at the plan stage will also provide certainty for developers who will know what is likely to be agreed before making an application.

It also encourages all parties to engage in more strategic, proactive planning rather than the tactical, reactive, rear-guard responses that we’ve seen too often in the past.

The second baseless charge levelled at our reforms is that they sweep away environmental protections for the countryside and undermine the green belt.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

Our local plan policies require developers to commit themselves to providing – and funding – a vast array of green infrastructure including whole new parks, green roofs, bee bricks and even the planting of community orchards.

Our reforms will ensure that all new streets will be tree-lined – allowing future development to mirror some of the world’s most iconic and beautiful examples of integrating nature into urban design – from the Heerstrasse of Bonn in Germany to the Champs-Elysees of Paris.

And on environmental assessments, we want to find a better way of assessing the impact of development on the environment, but we are categorically not weakening any of the existing protections, including our policies on the green belt.

The final myth that’s surfaced around our proposed planning reform is the unfounded charge that we risk ‘levelling down’ our urban areas with too much focus on the South East and too little in the North of England.

Our longer-term proposals prevent the amount of available land being a barrier to building the homes communities need through prioritising brownfield first and directing development to existing urban areas.

They will result in an overall increase in the number of homes being built across the whole country while delivering more houses in the least affordable areas.

When assessing housing need, we are taking bold action which will see enough homes built in the places where people and communities need them.  

That’s why we are proposing revising the number of homes authorities should plan for.

The proposals in our housing need consultation will increase the supply of land available for new homes to address affordability pressures, support economic growth and foster a more competitive housing market.

They place a much greater emphasis on affordability because, as a general rule, the least affordable places are those where supply has simply not kept up with demand.

And this has also resulted in people being prevented from living where they most want to.

Our proposals fix this problem by equipping councils with the tools they need to build homes where the economy says they are needed the most – where prices are higher and, in many cases, becoming worse.

Our standard method also identifies the minimum number of homes that a council should plan for without setting a target.

This means that decisions about where homes go will not be made by central government, but by local people who know their areas best. 

In Planning for the future, we are also consulting on proposals for a binding local housing requirement, but we are clear that this would take account of local constraints and needs, including protecting the green belt and maximising existing opportunities in towns and cities.

Lord Agnew and Land Release Fund

However, we also have to accept that if we are to build the homes this country needs, we need to make sure that enough land is released in the right places.  

At least 6% of all freehold land in England and Wales is owned by public sector organisations.

And around two-thirds of that land is owned by local government. 

The release of surplus local government land for housing can, and should, play a more significant role in delivering new homes whilst generating receipts that local authorities can then use to reinvest in public services. 

Our Land Release Fund is supporting 36 local authorities to do exactly that and it’s already taking forward 73 housing projects to release land for more than 6,000 new homes.

The One Public Estate Programme – a collaboration between MHCLG, the Cabinet Office and the Local Government Association – is another example of how we are supporting councils to deliver ambitious property-focused projects.

Since 2013, One Public Estate has contributed to the release of land for more than 14,000 homes but we know that we can go much further and much faster which is why we’ll be working on strengthening these programmes in the coming weeks and months.

Conclusion

Through the reforms I’ve outlined today, we will dramatically ramp up housing supply while delivering on our manifesto commitment to build a million new houses within the term of this Parliament.

…Because boosting supply locally is certainly not a matter of chance.

Council leaders and chief executives don’t just put a coin in a policy slot machine, pull the lever and wish for a local plan that delivers the right homes in the right places.

It takes hard work and strategic thought.

We want to help councils make full use of the tools they have at their disposal to unlock development at a local level - whether that be regenerating brownfield land, repurposing empty commercial property or releasing their own public land to the market.

And we won’t shy away from strengthening national initiatives such as our Affordable Homes Programme to help councils meet their housing demands while also creating new homes of all tenures; I know the Secretary of State will speak in more depth about this when he addresses this Festival.

Through a concerted effort from national and local government, we will ‘build, build, build’ while alleviating some of the worst affordability challenges that have held back our housing market for far too long.

In doing so, we will create the right economic conditions for our nation’s builders and developers to ‘build back’ stronger and more resilient than ever before.

"122","Speech","Home Secretary's statement on domestic abuse and coronavirus (COVID-19): 11 April 2020","Home Secretary Priti Patel announces support for domestic abuse victims at daily Government press conference.","This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 11 April 2020:
Coronavirus press conference 11 April 2020.

Good afternoon, welcome to Downing Street for the Government’s daily press conference on coronavirus.

I am joined today by Martin Hewitt, Chair of the National Police Chiefs Council, and by Professor Stephen Powis.

I would like to update you on the Government’s plan to fight this pandemic.

Our priority is to slow the spread of coronavirus, so that fewer people are sick at any one time, and our brilliant NHS continues to remain able to cope.

To do this we are following expert scientific and medical advice and taking the right steps at the right moment in time.

And that is why we are instructing people to stay home, to protect the NHS and save lives.

I can report that, through the Government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of 9am today:


    There have been 334,974 tests carried out across the UK, excluding Northern Ireland.
  
  
    Of these, 78,991 have tested positive.
  
  
    20,101 patients are currently in hospital who have already tested positive.
  
  
    Sadly, 9,875 people have now died – an increase of 917 of yesterday.
  
As this virus continues to devastate families across our nation, my thoughts, prayers and heartfelt condolences are with their friends, their families and loved ones.

To everyone suffering from this horrific virus, whether you are at home or receiving care from our brilliant NHS in hospital – you are in all of our thoughts at this devastating time.

And I am very pleased to say that the Prime Minister continues to make good progress.

But these stark figures highlight the gravity of this national emergency.

The devastating impact of this virus, and the unprecedented but necessary action we are taking to tackle it, is affecting every aspect of our daily lives.

This virus is also changing the nature of the threat we face from crime.

Martin and myself will today update you on the emerging crime picture and the extra work the Government – along with law enforcement partners – is undertaking to better protect victims.

As Martin will set out, total crime has dropped as people follow the necessary advice to stay at home.

But, while the guidelines are helping to keep the majority of us safe – we think they could also amplify danger for others – leaving people feeling isolated, vulnerable and exposed.

Because criminality continues to adapt.

Fraudsters are exploiting coronavirus as a hook for new acquisitive crimes – with losses to victims already exceeding £1.8million.

Perpetrators of sickening online child sexual abuse are seeking to exploit the fact that more young people and children are at home and are online.

And in the last week alone, the National Domestic Abuse Helpline reported a 120% rise in the number of calls it received in one 24-hour period.

Now while we have not yet seen a sustained rise in reports of domestic abuse to the police, the increase in those seeking help for this hidden crime is extremely concerning. And be in no doubt, there will be absolutely no let-up in our operational response.

For the victims of these crimes, home is not the safe-haven it should be.

That is why I have been working with law enforcement, charities, schools, businesses and local councils to address this changing threat picture.

Our incredible police officers and firefighters are out in their communities - yes fighting crime, but also protecting victims.

I want to emphasise that anyone who is a victim of these crimes can still get help.

Anyone in immediate danger should call 999 - and press 55 on a mobile if you are unable to talk.

Our outstanding police will, absolutely, still be there for you.

The National Crime Agency are also bearing down on offenders and raising awareness to protect victims of fraud, cyber-crime and online child abuse.

But, we must all do more to protect our neighbours, friends and family members by sharing information about the support that is available.

The Chancellor this week announced a £750million boost for charities, including those providing services for victims of domestic abuse and their families.

And today, I can announce that we will go even further to provide support for those in danger of domestic abuse.

And I am launching a new national communications campaign to reach out to those who are at risk from abuse, highlighting that they can still leave home – to get the support that they need.

It will signpost to victims how they can access help and but also to reassure them that they can access support services and the police are still on hand.

And, importantly, it will tell them that they are not alone.

Coronavirus has opened Britain’s enormous heart and shown our love and compassion for one another as we come together to help those most in need.

And I am now asking this nation to use that amazing compassion and community spirit to embrace those trapped in the horrific cycle of abuse.

And to help us all look out for those who need help, we have created a new campaign and we have created symbol of hope – a handprint with a heart on – so that people can easily show that we will not tolerate abuse as a society, and that we stand in solidarity with victims of domestic abuse.

I ask you and I would urge everyone to share it on social media or in the windows of your home, alongside a link to the support available, to demonstrate just how much this country cares.

And to show victims of domestic abuse, that they are not on their own.

I am also providing up to £2 million to enhance online support services and helplines for domestic abuse, so that anybody who needs that help and support can access that help and support.

These services will be boosted from new IT provided by the business, and in order to boost these services, we have secured support from Fujitsu to provide IT expertise to smaller domestic abuse charities to enable their specialist trained support workers to provide their crucial services remotely.

We also know there are concerns about the capacity of refuges to provide enough accommodation during this challenging time.

I’m clear about this – perpetrators should be the ones who have to leave the family home, not the supposed loved ones whom they torment and abuse.

Our priority is to get abusers out, but, sadly, this is not always possible.

So where a victim, and their children, do need to leave, we will ensure they have a safe place to go.

That’s why we are looking at alternative accommodation to  best support the work of refuges and ensure that there are enough places for those in need at this difficult time.

Fighting coronavirus requires an extraordinary national effort, and I would like to reiterate my personal thanks to everyone across all aspects of society playing their part.

I am immensely grateful to everyone who is heeding the instruction to stay at home.

This remains crucial over the bank holiday weekend and especially as the weather improves.

But we have given the police powers to enforce the necessary measures we have put in place, including through the enforcement of fines.

I’d like to thank them – our police officers and staff who are working tirelessly to keep us safe, for engaging with the public so constructively, to encourage everyone to do the right thing and avoid the need to use these powers.

The overwhelming majority of the people are listening, making their own sacrifices to support our amazing police officers and staff, as they protect our under-pressure hospitals, and safeguard the most vulnerable.

But my message to anyone still refusing to do the right thing is clear.

If you don’t play your part, our selfless police – who are out there risking their own lives to save others - will be unafraid to act.

Their work is helping our doctors, nurses and health professionals to fight this virus and to save lives.

If you do not follow the guidance, you will be endangering the lives of your own friends, families and loved ones.

To protect those you care about – and the capacity of our police and hospitals to protect us all – there is just one simple thing you must do.

Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives.","Home Office and The Rt Hon Priti Patel MP",2020-04-11,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/home-secretary-outlines-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims"
"123","Speech","Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)","The Secretary of State delivered a speech to the OECD Roundtable on the UK’s innovative response to the Coronavirus crisis and our approach to recovery.","Thank you colleagues, Minister, Secretary-General for the opportunity to contribute to this important discussion. 
As others have said, COVID-19 is the biggest challenge the world has faced in decades, and the OECD has played a crucial part in providing in-depth analysis on the impact of this disease, and it will be important for the OECD to continue this work as we recover.

Now in the UK going from a situation in which we had enjoyed record employment rates, we took steps straight away to ensure that no one was going to be penalised for doing the right thing to protect themselves, their families and their communities.

That involved modifying access to sick pay, streamlining our main social security system (Universal Credit), which had to respond to unprecedented numbers of claims during the pandemic. We did make temporary changes on access to the benefits to manage that demand and get money to people as quickly as possible. But now we’re over the peak we will be returning to our usual processes to help people back into work.

In the UK we avoided mass unemployment with the swift introduction of the Job Retention Scheme, also known as the furlough scheme in which taxpayers guaranteed 80% of employees’ pay up to £2,500 per month and the Self Employment support scheme.

Both of these schemes have been a lifeline to millions of people. Over 9 million people were supported on the Job Retention Scheme, and over two and a half [sic] self-employed people by that individual scheme. The key aim was to help employers and their employees to be connected, to stay connected, so they were ready to resume as soon as the economy properly restarted.

And so we are making changes to the scheme from next month. That extra flexibility will help get people working again as we will definitely phase out the Job Retention Scheme entirely by the end of October.
The road to full recovery will be long and many people are relying on us to create the right environment to recover the stability they need to pick up their lives and futures again. That is why we are working to deliver a package of measures that will stimulate the economy, support job growth, and get people back to work safely, while continuing to protect the most vulnerable.

As José said, data is key on this, especially as we don’t know exactly how the economy and this situation is going to unfold. We don’t quite yet know how consumer behaviour will have changed, and so we do need to be agile in the months and year ahead.

In terms of considering vulnerable groups, we must ensure that our measures continue to protect all workers in need, and we will redouble our global efforts to eradicate all forms of exploitation. Training will be crucial for those without work, so they maintain their work-readiness and gain new skills to quickly move sector and pivot back into work.

We are particularly focusing on young people, who are already disadvantaged due to their lack of skills and experience. So that’s why our new youth offer will support this group into work, with the aim of reducing the long-term scarring effect.

Colleagues, finally this is a time for the global community to stand together to ensure that this significant but temporary disruption does not inflict permanent damage to the global economy. We welcome the work the OECD is doing to support the implementation of the G20 Action Plan, and I look forward to seeing you all at a successful October meeting.","Department for Work and Pensions and The Rt Hon Thérèse Coffey MP",2020-07-09,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/therese-coffeys-speaking-notes-from-the-oecd-event"

In line with others, I want to thank you, on behalf of the United Kingdom, for calling this meeting on the multilateral trade response, to the most serious global challenge in a generation, one that is also transforming the global trading system, and as the WTO’s own analysis shows, risks seriously undermining it.

But first, I would like to recall my statement at the Heads of Delegation meeting yesterday, conveying the United Kingdom’s warmest wishes to Director General Azevedo, upon the announcement of his stepping down, and thanking him for all he has done – and will continue to do – throughout his term. The United Kingdom heeds the DG’s call for Members to move quickly to appoint a successor, and stands ready to support Ambassador David Walker with the next steps in the process.

Now, let me turn to today’s discussion on the Covid-19 crisis.

This is a global crisis.  This pandemic is already the worst international health crisis for a century.  By the time it it finished, it risks also becoming the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and a global social and political crisis into the bargain.

The multilateral system has a critical role to play in mitigating this worst case scenario, and, to coin a phrase, bending the curve of this crisis below the ability of the global political and economic system to cope.  Geneva has already responded well, and after a difficult negotiation, the World Health Assembly will adopt an important resolution on Monday, to guide us through the next phase of the pandemic, and ensure we learn and adapt as we go forward.

The WTO also has a major role to play.  While we understand the challenges for the organisation in meeting formally, it is still the world’s leading platform for discussing global trade, with senior trade representatives from around the world.  It is the place where the impact on COVID-19 on the global trading system should be discussed, where ideas and solutions should be shared, and were initiatives to mitigate the global economic crisis to come, launched.

In that spirit, the UK welcomes today’s meeting of the General Council, and looks forward to much more debate in the future.

Now, let me turn to the WTO response more specifically.

So far, the Secretariat has proactively collated information and published useful analytical pieces. In support of that effort, the United Kingdom has provided relevant information, including regularly contributing to the Covid specific surveillance platform hosted on the WTO webpage and submitting a return to the Director General for the Trade Monitoring Report.

The United Kingdom would welcome more frequent Trade Monitoring reports - for example, returning to the quarterly reports during the financial crisis.  We agree with Switzerland that there is much more that the WTO and is Members can do.  The WTO needs to be the place where the trade restricting measures that have been introduced in response to COVID-19 are reported, their consequences debated, and our collective determination to resist serious damage they could do to the global economy expressed.

The UK also welcomes the fact that Members have started to coordinate responses to Covid, informally through the WTO, as well as through other groupings like the G20.

So, together with a range of other WTO Members, the United Kingdom has cosponsored statements on key issues.

For example, we believe in the importance of keeping global agricultural supply chains open, especially given the relatively high levels of food stocks and production we see globally, so signed the statement led by our Canadian colleagues.  We welcome the idea of holding a dedicated meeting in June to discuss this.

We were also pleased to support the Swiss-led statement in support of the multilateral trading system, and the statement in support of MSMEs led by our Uruguayan, Canadian and Mexican colleagues.

As this crisis evolves, we will continue to work with Members on appropriate initiatives supporting free, fair and inclusive rules-based trade.  We will also seek to advance this agenda elsewhere, and like the DG, we welcome the the outcomes agreed at the virtual extraordinary G20 Trade Ministers’ meeting yesterday.

We are keenly aware that many developing country partners, as well as small island states and other vulnerable economies, are experiencing a serious period of trade shock, as currency depreciations combine with sharp declines in important export sectors like tourism. This potentially jeopardises decades of hard-fought, trade-led prosperity.

Today I’d like to announce that, through the UK’s Trade and Investment Advocacy Fund and our funding to the World Bank, we are providing support to eligible developing country Members to better understand the trade-related impacts of COVID-19 on their economies, notify COVID-related measures to the WTO’s monitoring exercise, and tackle the COVID crisis through better trade facilitation.

Lastly, Chair, let me turn to the importance of continuing with regular business.
   
It is important that this crisis does not set back the important work that the WTO has been tasked with. Beyond ensuring the reinstatement of a fully functioning dispute resolution system, and continuing the crucial regular monitoring and transparency work, we need to continue to work on live negotiations.

These negotiations - including on fisheries subsidies, e-commerce, MSMEs, domestic regulation in services and investment facilitation for development– are a critical part of a broader discussion on how this institution should better meet the needs of 21st century business and society.

Thank you Chair.","Department for International Development, Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Department for International Trade, and Julian Braithwaite",2020-05-15,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-statement-to-the-wto-general-council"
"125","Speech","UK Statement to the WTO General Council","The UK's Ambassador to the WTO and UN in Geneva, Julian Braithwaite, delivered this statement to the WTO General Council on 29 May 2020.","As this is the first time I’m taking the floor, I would like to say farewell to all those who are leaving us and thank them for their cooperation and friendship. I wish you all the best.

We have heard from many this morning about the scale of the COVID-19 crisis, and what it means for the global economy.

One thing we all know to be true is that, while this pandemic began as a global health crisis, it is now morphing into a global economic crisis in which no country will be spared.

In the 1930s, the crisis caused by the financial crash of 1929 led to unrestrained protectionism which enormously exacerbated the scale of global economic devastation that followed. This period is not known as the Great Depression for nothing.

Today, we are seeing an increase in protectionism in response to this pandemic, compounding an unprecedented collapse in global trade, as a consequence of the global lockdown.

It is not an exaggeration to say that we risk another Great Depression if we don’t take action, collectively, to protect the global trading system from serious long-term damage.

So what does that mean for our deliberations today?

First, we cannot afford a leadership vacuum between Roberto’s departure and his successor taking up the helm. If we want the World Trade Organization to be relevant in this crisis, we need a sense of urgency.

Second, the United Kingdom supports and open transparent and inclusive process, but we believe that this is possible if we make it a priority and accept that this will rely on virtual meetings.

Third, I urge colleagues to make the case to our capitals about why this should be a priority precisely because strong leadership by the WTO will be one of the best ways we can minimize the damage this virus is doing to the global economy, and accelerate the process of building back better.

The United Kingdom will be offering our strong support to Ambassador Walker’s efforts to run consultations in line with expedited deadlines, as necessary for this selection process; and we will be working with all other WTO Members to help facilitate the smoothest possible process to select a successor.","Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Department for International Trade, and Julian Braithwaite",2020-05-29,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-statement-to-the-wto-general-council--2"
"126","Speech","Baroness Dido Harding’s speech to the CBI Annual Conference","Baroness Dido Harding talks about the achievements of NHS Test and Trace, and the focus to improve the service so that we're better able to live with COVID through the winter and beyond.","Speech by Baroness Dido Harding, Interim Executive Chair of the National Institute for Health Protection

If it is okay, I will start as you suggested by looking back a second. Clearly, this is a very difficult point for the country, on the weekend the Prime Minister alongside Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance were really clear that this second national lockdown is not what anyone would have wished, but it is necessary to protect our NHS capacity and protect lives. And if we look back I would like to talk briefly about what has been achieved in the last 6 months.

I know that it is hard to see it, but the picture of the country coming into this activity, coming into this second set of national measures, is very different to the last one. Our schools and universities are open, the NHS is not yet overwhelmed, and we have the data and insight to see what is coming so that we are able to act earlier.

As a country we are trying to balance the health of the population with the health of the economy, and society’s and individual’s needs, as Mathew just said, in terms of educating our children and our own mental wellbeing. These are clearly incredibly difficult decisions, and I have quite a large job, but those decisions are not for me, those are decisions outside of NHS Test and Trace. Those are ones for our elected leaders both nationally and locally to take.

Let me step back a step. COVID-19 is the greatest public health challenge we have faced in modern times, and NHS Test and Trace has been built in an extraordinarily rapid way to address that. We have built a system the size of Asda, from scratch, in 5 months. We are working around the clock to keep expanding and improving it.

To give you a sense of the scale, we have built a network of NHS, private and not-for-profit laboratories to take testing capacity from 2,000 tests a day in March to over 500,000 test a day today. Historically, this is more per head than Germany, Italy, Spain and the US. It is the largest diagnostic network the UK has ever seen, and I suspect it is the fastest growing public service we have ever built.

Yesterday we hit our target of 500,000 tests a day, from over 600 locations. So (I’m an ex-retailer), we have opened 600 shops in 5 months. We’ve now processed close to 32 million tests. We have also built the largest outbound call centre in the UK. So our contact-testing services are dealing with 7 times the volume it was 7 weeks ago, and so far we have contacted 1.4 million people and have asked them to isolate.

And we also have a digital wing, so you know we launched the COVID-19 app which has now had 19 million downloads in its first month, so 40% of the eligible population of the UK have it on their phones and that is a better performance than any other country where downloading isn’t compulsory.

And the response from business has been extraordinary to the app: over 700,000 QR posters are up and about across the country. None of this would be possible without public, private, national and local partnership. So we are, as a nation, throwing everything at this, and this is a combination of national insight and firepower with local intelligence and experience.

We have tripled the size of our local health protection teams to trace the virus and support businesses, and public sector employers locally when there are outbreaks. And we have got increasingly integrated teams which have developed some very strong relationships with local leaders and local businesses. But – and it is a big but – there is clearly more that we need to do.

This virus is incredibly difficult to deal with. And it is deadly, with millions of people carrying the virus around the world but not displaying any symptoms. Every country is grappling with the same problem, and despite everyone’s best efforts and all of the work of our team in the NHS Test and Trace to be the second line of defence, after Hands, Face and Space, the virus is spreading far too rapidly and too widely.

So if that’s where we are now and we look ahead as we go into another a really challenging period for us as a country, it is time for the organisation that I lead to take the next big leap forward. As lockdown slows us from the virus, we will be focusing on improving NHS Test and Trace, so that when England emerges from lockdown we are better able to live with COVID through the winter and beyond. We are thinking about that.

The work we have got to do is in 4 main areas.

The first one is scale. As I said, we built this extraordinary thing in 6 months but it needs to be substantially bigger and it will keep growing. We have been innovating and investing in new technologies, so these new mass testing, rapid testing technologies will give us the potential to scale testing much further. We have pilots in hospitals, schools and universities, which are showing some positive results already. As we announced last night into this morning, we will be working with Liverpool, the first city to deploy testing as a combination of the traditional swab testing and the new rapid turn around lateral tests that are quite like pregnancy tests.

So we have got to scale up testing, and as we find more and more positive cases we’ve got to scale up contact tracing as well. We are already the largest outbound calling centre in the UK, but it’s got to get bigger as we find more people with the disease, and we’ve got to get faster. Our turnaround times for both testing and contact tracing are improving, but this is the ultimate perishable good. We need to find people who have been in close contact with people who have got the disease within 24 to 48 hours. So there is a big job of work for my team to do to keep speeding up. And we can only do this as I have said through partnership.

This is about working in partnership with the public and the private sector, with national and local organisations and with everyone in the country. And I’m sure that many people watching this have read that Stan McChrystal’s book ‘Team of Teams’, this is the ultimate team of teams – we are actually 60 million people on the team. We have all got to change our behaviour just a little bit to come forward with the testing to isolate when we are told to. That’s how you break the chains of transmission.

And the fourth area we are working on is how we get even better at using the data in the analysis to drive insight in action we can stamp on outbreaks faster and faster. We know so much more than we did 6 months ago about how the disease is spreading. We’ve got the data from Test and Trace, we’ve got the data from waste water. We’ve got data from all these surveys using the testing capacity we have built. We are all learning how to use that to stop it spreading.

And I know that it is really tough and horrible for everyone as we head towards Thursday. But I am actually quite hopeful that we have more tools in the armoury than we had before. As a society we have learnt about the first line of defence, washing our hands, keeping our distance and wearing our face mask. Test and Trace did not exist in March. It is a scale organisation the same size as Asda and it will get even bigger. And so our second line of defence is growing, and technology will help us through a combination of vaccine, mass testing and better treatment. There is a lot for us actually to be optimistic about that we will crack this.","Department of Health and Social Care",2020-11-06,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/baroness-dido-hardings-speech-to-the-cbi-annual-conference"
"127","Speech","Business Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 28 March 2020","Business Secretary Alok Sharma gave the 28 March 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Coronavirus press conference 28 March 2020

Good afternoon.

As of 9am on 28 March, a total of 120,776 people have been tested, of which 103,687 were confirmed negative and 17,089 were confirmed positive.

As of 5pm on 27 March, 1,019 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus have sadly died.

As with our population, for businesses large and small, coronavirus represents an unprecedented challenge.

Speaking with business leaders and representative organisations every day, I appreciate just how tough the situation is.

When we tell people to “stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives”, we know it has a real cost to your families and your firms.

And I want to thank the many businesses and workers, right across the UK, who are playing a vital role in keeping the British economy going.

You are delivering for our nation through this difficult time and we said we would deliver for you, doing whatever it takes.

That is why we have taken unprecedented action to support our economy, to save jobs and secure livelihoods.

To help businesses pull through at this difficult time we have set out income support schemes, for both the employed and self-employed, as well as a package of grants, loans, business rate holidays and VAT deferrals.

Businesses and trade unions have welcomed our interventions and I want to reassure them that we are working around the clock to get the funding, as quickly as possible, to where it is needed.

On Monday we launched the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme.

This scheme is designed to make it easier for businesses with a turnover of up to £45 million to access vital financial support.

So far, the scheme’s 40 accredited lenders, including all high street banks, are processing thousands of applications.

This week, I provided guidance to English councils on the grants to our smallest businesses, including those operating in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors.

The first tranche of funding arrived with English councils yesterday. I want to ensure that grant money is with businesses as soon as possible, providing direct funding support to almost a million businesses across our country.

Now whilst our companies have requested financial support, they have also asked us to look to ease the burden of regulation at this challenging time and we have responded to that request.

Yesterday, we brought forward legislation to temporarily suspend some competition rules in the supermarkets sector and in the operation of the Isle of Wight ferries.

From retailers sharing delivery vans to ferry operators coordinating staff, these measures will allow firms to work together to deliver vital services to the public more effectively at this time.

We have also introduced measures to ensure that workers who have not taken all of their statutory annual leave due to COVID-19, will now be able to carry that entitlement over into the next 2 years.

This will protect staff from losing out, whilst providing businesses with flexibility when they need it most.

Earlier this week, together with Companies House, we announced that over 4 million businesses will be granted a 3 month extension to the filing their accounts, through a fast-track online process.

Over 10,000 businesses have already successfully applied for this extension.

And we will continue to monitor companies’ ability to meet the range of other filing obligations they have under the Companies Act, and we will provide further extensions if needed.

I recognise just how how hard employees, business owners and directors, are working to keep their companies going.

It is crucial that when the crisis passes, as it will, we are ready to bounce back.

And so today I want to announce more measures, which are designed to give businesses greater flexibility as they face the current crisis, to help them emerge intact the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We will introduce measures to improve the insolvency system, which provides the legal options for companies running into major difficulties.

Our overriding objective is to help UK companies which need to undergo a financial rescue or restructuring process to keep trading. These measures will give those firms extra time and space to weather the storm and be ready when the crisis ends, whilst ensuring that creditors get the best return possible in circumstances.

The changes to the insolvency regime will include new rules to make sure companies undergoing restructuring can continue to get hold of supplies and raw materials.

And there will be a temporary suspension of wrongful trading provisions for company directors, to remove the threat of personal liability during the pandemic. This provision will have retrospective effect from 1 March. However, to be clear, all of the other checks and balances that help to ensure directors fulfil their duties properly, will remain in force.

We will bring forward legislation in these areas at the earliest opportunity.

We will also put in place measures to ensure that companies required to hold Annual General Meetings (AGM) can do so flexibly, in a manner that is compatible with the best public health guidance.

This might include postponing, or holding the AGM online or by phone using only proxy voting.

In addition, we are also introducing a range of measures to boost the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face masks, to protect frontline NHS staff.

And we’re removing administrative barriers for the production of hand sanitiser. By reducing the amount of red tape, new suppliers and businesses that produce ingredients for safe hand sanitisers, will be able to bring their products to market in a matter of days.

Companies including BrewDog and Ineos have already stepped forward to offer their services.

I am incredibly proud of how businesses and individuals across our great nation, have risen to the challenge posed by COVID-19.

Whether it’s offers from companies coming forward to support the ventilator challenge…

or more than 700,000 people signing up to volunteer for our brilliant NHS…

or those in the public and private sector working hard to keep our country safe and moving.

Britain is meeting the challenge. Working together in a joint endeavour to get through this pandemic.

And be in no doubt, the government will continue to fight tooth and nail to protect lives and livelihoods everywhere in this country as we stand shoulder to shoulder with our people and our businesses.

Firstly can I add my own condolences to the families and friends of all those who have so sadly passed away, due to COVID-19.

At the outset of this awful crisis it became clear that what we needed to do, was do all we can to make sure we were protecting some of the most vulnerable people in our society.

And we must continue to do so, the pandemic is not over.

For homeless people, the task was to bring as many people in off the streets and out of communal shelters.

The goal was to protect rough sleepers from the virus, give them the chance to self-isolate, and, ultimately therefore, to do the best we can to save their lives.

There was an absolutely extraordinary response, across the public sector, charities and businesses in response to my call to get ‘everyone in’.

Those efforts have resulted in close to 15,000 people across England now being helped.

I’d like to take this opportunity, alongside the Secretary of State, to thank everyone involved – it was an extraordinary and unusual endeavour. From the dedicated outreach workers, the hard-working council staff to hotels that have opened their doors, and faith and community groups who provided friendship and food.

It has been a heartening example of what we can do when we need to do it and the best of Britain in this time of crisis.

And, by bringing almost everyone in, we now have an another extraordinary and unusual endeavour ahead, to try and change their lives for good beyond the immediate response to COVID-19.

I stand ready to work with all partners and esteemed colleagues in Wales, in Scotland and in Northern Ireland.

So, I’m really pleased the government is investing in these 6,000 new homes along with the extra support and money for the costs of their support. Meaning that we can help the most vulnerable rough sleepers, in the long term.

This is a really good start. I am grateful to the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister for their support. But none of us should underestimate the challenge ahead in order to keep everyone in.

There is much more that we need to do, but for now, I’d just like to thank – those in local government, the health service, the civil servants and the countless charities and community groups, who have helped protect this, one of our most vulnerable groups in our society, during this pandemic.

And those, such as the Prince’s Trust, Business in the Community, Comic Relief, the Anglican and Catholic churches who have pledged wider support.

So, now that so many are inside, I hope that we can keep it that way. What has been done here, is a small but incredible silver lining – in the dark cloud, that is COVID-19.

Good afternoon and welcome once again to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.

I’m joined today by Professor John Newton, who co-ordinates our work on testing, and Professor Stephen Powis, who is the Medical Director of the NHS.

Every day we are working through our plan to protect life and protect the NHS by slowing the spread and building the capacity so that, at all times, the NHS has got the capacity to give can offer the very best care to everyone who needs it.

In today’s briefing, after setting out the daily statistics, I want to talk about testing.

But beforehand I would like to share some really good news. Earlier this week, I said that we are now able to begin the restoration of NHS services. Now that we are past the peak, I can tell you about the next step ‒ the restoration of fertility services.

Few families have been untouched by the amazing advances in fertility treatment over the past generation, and I know just how time-sensitive fertility treatment can be. And I know how important it is to the families affected. And I know that this treatment can change lives for the better, forever.

So when I say thank you to all of you everybody watching for staying at home to protect the NHS, of course I’m saying thank you on behalf of the lives you are saving. But I’m also saying thanks on behalf of the lives that the NHS can now once again, help to create.

Because, together, we have protected the NHS, and now we are now restoring the NHS, and restoring the chance for so many couples to start a family.

Daily statistics

Turning to the figures, 177,454 people have tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 6,201 since yesterday. 15,111 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus and 27,510 people have now sadly died across all settings, an increase of 739. As one, we will remember them and treasure their memories.

This is a virus that has a devastating impact on families, friends, on local communities. And right across government, we are working day and night to defeat it.

At the beginning of last month, at this podium, I set a goal that anyone who needs a test should get a test. And that as a nation, we should achieve 100,000 tests per day by the end of the month. I knew that it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal because testing is so important for getting Britain back on her feet.

I can announce that we have met our goal. The number of tests, yesterday, on the last day of April, was 122,347.
This unprecedented expansion in British testing capability is an incredible achievement. But it is not my achievement. It is a national achievement, achieved by a huge team of people working together.

And I tell you this: the testing capacity that we built, together, will help every single person in this country.
Testing is crucial to suppress the virus.

I know from personal experience, too, just how much people with symptoms want to know if they have got the disease. I know that I did. It helps remove the worry, it helps keep people safe, and it will help us to unlock the lockdown.

So many people have tragically died and the challenge that we still face is so huge, but we are making real progress.

I want to take a moment to thank and pay tribute to the incredible team who did this together and who joined together in one of the greatest national mobilisations that we’ve seen.

We brought together the best civil servants, the best minds from the private sector, the best scientists, the best lab technicians and the best of the best in the armed forces.

Setting stretching, ambitious goals in a crisis has a galvanising effect on everyone involved. It’s a mission. If we hadn’t been so bold, if we had chosen a safer, easier path, I just can’t see how we would have built the capacity that we need.

In a short few weeks, we’ve:


    created a new test for the virus
  
  
    built a network of regional testing centres
  
  
    put a fleet of mobile testing units on the road
  
  
    and created home testing kits, so if you can’t get to a test, we can get the test to you
  
We’ve more than doubled the capacity of NHS and Public Health England labs, and created 3 brand new mega-labs to analyse the results.

So many people have played a part in this work. British diagnostic companies like Randox and Oxford Nanopore and Medical Wire and DNANudge and Samba. Logistics companies like the Royal Mail and Yodel, who were brilliant and got us out of a real hole this week. Academics like Professor Derek Crook and Sir John Bell from Oxford, and Professor Ara Darzi from Imperial.

Deloitte and Boots who have delivered our drive-through centres, AstraZeneca, GSK and Novacyte, whose lab goes on stream next week, Public Health England and the NHS, of course, who pulled out all the stops. Professor Sharon Peacock, Professor John Newton And UK Biocentre and the Crick, who set up high-tech laboratories.

And also it wasn’t just a national effort. People from across the world ‒ including ThermoFisher, Hologic, Abbott and Amazon from the US, Qiagen from Germany and Roche from Switzerland.

And this is how we did it. Because everybody everyone worked together with grit and determination to reach a shared goal, and they thrived because the team contained a diversity of perspectives, backgrounds and, critically, a diversity of thought.

And when things went wrong, which they did every single day, believe me, we didn’t ask who we could blame – we asked how we could fix it.

So, to my team, I want to say: you toiled tirelessly, night and day, and I am so proud of what you have achieved. To all of you, on behalf of the government and on behalf of the whole country, thank you.

As the Prime Minister has said, a big increase in testing provides a way to unlock the puzzle of coronavirus, and testing forms the first element of our plan to test, track and trace.

By mid-May we will have an initial 18,000 contact tracers in place. That work is underway as we speak. And if it needs to be bigger, we will scale it as required.

The combination of contact tracers and new technology, through our new COVID-19 NHS app will help tell us where the virus is spreading and help everyone to control new infections.

People will be able to know if they have been in close contact with someone who is transmitting the disease, and take the action that they need to. Our full-scale test, track and trace model will drive the infection rate down and the lower the R, and the lower the number of new infections, the more effective the track and trace system will be.

Tracking and tracing will allow us to get R down, and hold R down, and so it will allow us to lift lockdown measures.

Now this disease affects us all indiscriminately, we’ve seen that. In recent weeks, we have had to impinge on historic liberties to protect our NHS and our loved ones, and yet our goal must be freedom. Freedom from the virus, yes – and we will not lift measures until it is safe to do so.

But also we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom too. Each citizen’s right to do as they please. For now, we are working together to stay home. We are impinging on the freedom of all, for the safety of all.

With this next mission, of test, track and trace, I am seeking a solution that allows us – by each of us participating – to target the measures that are needed with much more precision, and so to reassert as much as is safely possible, the liberty of us all.

That is our next mission. But for now, the most important thing for everyone to do, to keep R down and to get us all through this, is to maintain the spirit and the resolve that has had such an impact thus far.

So, please, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-05-01,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-1-may-2020"

I’m joined by Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries.

Dr Harries is going to set out our next steps for the 2.2 million people who have been shielding for the last 3 months. Just before we do, I’d like to take you through the latest data.

This slide shows the number of tests that have been carried out, now over 8 million tests in total. And it also shows that for the first time since the peak, the number of positive cases confirmed is under a thousand, at 958. Next slide.

The second slide shows the number of people in hospital, the top of the two shows the number of people admitted with COVID-19, which is 380. That’s down from 432 a week ago. The bottom chart shows the number of ventilated patients. That’s the number of patients on a mechanical ventilator, and that number is 330, down from 395 a week earlier. Clearly the number of people going into hospital and the number of people in the most serious condition in hospital in ventilated beds, both coming down. Next slide please.

The regional picture is broadly the same across the country and for the first time since the peak there are fewer than 5,000 people in hospital with coronavirus. And if we go to the final slide, thank you.

Thankfully the number of people who have died from coronavirus each day is also coming down. The latest data show that yesterday 15 more deaths were reported. This is the lowest figure since mid-March, the 15 March. Each of these deaths is someone who is loved and someone we mourn. And each death his one death too many. Nevertheless, the fact that we have a figure of reported deaths that is 15, much lower than any previous figure since the peak, is good news. However, it’s a weekend figure and we do see the number of deaths reported tend to rise after a weekend.

Nevertheless having set out all those statistics, if you take into account the number of people in hospitals, the number of people going into hospital, the number of people testing positive and the number who sadly have died, all of those figures are coming down and are pointing in the right direction.

It shows that, while there is still much to do, we are clearly making progress. We are working through our plan and our plan is working.

We protected the NHS and thanks to the patience and sacrifice of everyone watching, infections are falling, the NHS is restoring and the virus is in retreat.

A month ago, around 1 in 400 people had the virus. Now it’s around 1 in 1,700.

This means that tomorrow the Prime Minister will be able to set out the next steps in our plan for more local action, and to ease the national lockdown.

And there’s one group who have been more patient and given up more than almost any other, and that’s the 2.2 million people who have been shielding in England.

Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own shielding programmes, so what we say today is about England only.

Since the start, the clinical advice has been to protect those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to this disease.

Our shielding programme – that has delivered medicine, support and more than a million food boxes – has been integral to that plan.

I want to now speak directly to those of you who’ve been shielding.

Like so many, I have friends and I have family who’ve been shielding. I know what a burden this has been.

Shielding has involved not leaving your house for months, not seeing people you love, not being able to wander to the park for some fresh air, or even pop to the shops for something you need.

This sacrifice has been for a purpose, and I want to thank every single one of you.

We knew it was a difficult ask, but these measures have been vital in saving lives.

Right from the start we’ve been clear that we didn’t want the shielding advice to be in place any longer than was clinically necessary.

I’m very, very grateful to the clinicians who have led this work and kept the clinical advice under review.

Dr Harries will now set out the next steps in that clinical advice and then I’ll set out the practical support that we’ll be maintaining.

Dr Harries

I thought it might be helpful to say a few words on the clinical basis for the shielding programme: what we’re advising now and what we might see in the future. Particularly to the adults but also to the children who’ve been shielding.

This is a new virus, we’re continuing to learn about its transmission and that knowledge will continue to grow over the coming years.

At the start of the epidemic in the UK, using the information we had available, and our best understanding gained from other respiratory viruses, such as flu and SARS, we recognised that some people would likely be more vulnerable of severe outcomes from disease than others. This included older people and those with underlying medical conditions. Those are normally the people who would have a flu vaccination each year.

This clinically vulnerable group we advised to be particularly stringent in following social distancing guidance. That recommendation continues.

Senior clinicians recognise that for a small sub-set of the population there may be an even greater risk. So, for example, this would be those who may be on particularly high combinations of immunosuppressant treatments or where their disease was particularly poorly controlled.

This group, the clinically extremely vulnerable, were those advised to shield.

Shielding doesn’t alter the risk of illness if they become infected. It reduces the likelihood of meeting the virus in their daily lives. Now we’re out of the peak of the epidemic in the UK and estimated levels of community transmission and infection are back to those before shielding commenced, we are in a position to start relaxing the shielding advice over the next few weeks. We may well actually have some summer weather a little in our favour too.

Therefore the advice to those shielding is to start taking steps now to start coming back to a more normal lifestyle.

This has been a very difficult and sometimes frightening period for those shielding. To give people time to prepare we’re setting out the advice in a stepped approach. So first, from July 6, which is a time period when other measures have been eased to make sure we are monitoring the epidemiology continuously, we’re advising that people who are shielding may want to start meeting in groups of up to 6 outdoors, including those from outside their household.

If you live alone or are a lone parent you can form a support bubble with another household. Those in that support bubble can then spend time in each others homes, including overnight.

Secondly from August 1 we will pause shielding. We will still be advising people to stay at home as much as possible and to minimise contact with others outside their household. From August 1 our advice would be that people can go out to more places, see more people. This might include going to the shops, for example, or visiting a place of worship.

If you do leave your home you should continue to keep a safe distance from people at all time, regularly washing your hands for 20 seconds is still one of the most effective ways that you can protect yourself. If you’re unable to work from home from August 1, you’re able to return to work, as long as the business is COVID-safe.

When this programme started we used a precautionary principle. New evidence is telling us that the risks for individuals are often more clearly due to a combination of factors in that individual such as age, ethnicity, obesity levels for example, as well as the medical conditions that they have.

The Chief Medical Officer has commissioned work to ensure that, should we need to step up the shielding programme again, we would have available a much more individualised way for you and your doctor to understand your risk and receive more tailored advice.

The new risk assessment research methodology is being published today by academic colleagues led by Oxford University. In the future, therefore, those who we advise to take action may be slightly different group to those who shielded through this new disease peak.

Where this is particularly relevant is for children. As evidence has evolved, we’ve seen that admission to hospital for all children under 18 for COVID-19 is very low indeed. Only 36 children in the UK have been admitted to intensive care. Shielding guidance to date has covered a broad range of conditions and clinical vulnerabilities. We know that many parents have been worried about how they can protect their children, and they often carry the burden themselves.

Now we have new guidance developed by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and this will help families understand who does and does not need to shield. Now we have more evidence we can be much more specific about risk and it’s very likely in the future very few children will need to shield.

The evidence the clinical experts have brought together strongly recommends children and young people who are cared for just in primary care are very unlikely to need to continue to shield in the future. There is a group of children who exist that, due to their underlying condition, may need to continue to shield. Over the summer parents can look forward to discussions through routine paediatric appointments. In the interim we will be talking with your doctors and the royal colleges to ensure everyone has the right information. For now there is no need for parents to speak to their doctor immediately. We will sort that information out in due course.

For anybody with underlying clinical conditions, whether adult or child, looking forward and after shielding advice has paused we will still advise you to be careful. Keep your overall social interactions down, as low as feels comfortable initially, whether at home or in work, keep practising good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.

Finally I would like to say special thank you to clinical colleagues, particularly in primary care, and specialists in hospitals and all of their staff who have been working hard to support those shielding over the last 3 months

Secretary of State for Health and Social Care

I’ll just set out the practical consequences of all this. I’m sure the whole nation is grateful, Jenny, that your wisdom is guiding this work and grateful for setting out the clinical advice so clearly.

Over the next few weeks we’ll all have time for these changes.

First, In the coming days, as I promised I will write to everyone on the shielded patient list with further details about what this means for you and what to expect, and we will update our online guidance in line with these changes.

I know that after 3 months of shielding it might take time to adjust to the new guidelines.

We are working closely with the NHS, councils and charities to make sure this updated advice is as clear as possible.

If you are receiving centrally provided food boxes or medicine deliveries, this will continue until the end of July.
And I can announce that 7 supermarkets have confirmed ongoing access to priority supermarket delivery slots, for as long as they are needed.

Support from NHS Volunteer Responders will continue, and so too will the support from NHS mental health services for those struggling with their mental health.

And for anyone facing financial hardship, we’ve made money available to councils to help those struggling to buy food and other essentials.

And my message to employers is crystal clear. Please work with us to ease the transition back to a more normal way of life for shielding employees. We expect you to do the right thing.

Nothing matters more than keeping people safe, and we will keep the evidence about the risks to people under constant review.

The NHS will maintain the shielded patient list and we stand ready to support people to shield again if that’s what’s clinically required, including through an enhanced digital platform.

The support for the shielded has been a huge effort of community spirit, with practical and emotional support alongside the brilliant work of Public Health England and the NHS, supported by my department, the communities department and under the leadership of Chris Townsend in government.

So I want to say a huge thank you to those who shielded, to all those who looked after them, and to each and every one of you who’ve played your part in the national effort to bring this virus under control.

Together, let’s keep going.

Stay alert, control the virus, and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-06-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-june-2020"
"131","Speech","Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 April 2020","Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock gave the 23 April 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Coronavirus press conference: 23 April 2020

Welcome back to Downing Street for today’s daily coronavirus briefing.

I’m joined by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, and Professor John Newton, who is co-ordinating our work on testing.

The government is working through our action plan, which has as its core that we must protect life and protect the NHS, both by slowing the spread of the virus so that we flatten the curve and by ensuring that the NHS is always there to treat all people who need its care.

According to the most recent figures, 583,496 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 23,560 tests carried out yesterday. 138,078 people have tested positive for the virus, that’s an increase of 4,583 cases since yesterday. 17,615 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 18,189 on 21 April. And sadly, of those hospitalised, 18,738 have now died. And that is an increase of 616 fatalities since yesterday.

And although this number is lower than it has been in previous days, I stop and think of each one. They will not be forgotten and their stories will live on.

We must maintain our resolve and follow the social distancing rules. Because they are working. They are protecting the NHS. And they are saving lives.

To lift the measures too soon, and to risk a second peak, would be a mistake. It would undo all of the hard work that’s been done and it would be bad for our nation’s health and for our nation’s economy.

We can only start to change the measures:

when the NHS can continue to cope
  when the operational challenges have been met
  when the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently
  when the rate of infection is decreasing
  and, most importantly, when there’s no risk of a second peak
We need to bring the incidence of new infection right down. We’ll then use a rigorous programme of test, track and trace and keep it down, so we can safely release more of the restrictions.

And, today, I want to set out our progress on test, track and trace, which is such an important part of the measures that we’re taking and the work we’re doing.

First, testing. We set the goal of 100,000 tests a day by the end of this month. I knew when we set it that this was a challenging target.

Capacity is now ahead of our plans – and even overnight has increased from 40,000 to 51,000. And, because capacity has increased so substantially, we are now able to expand who can get the tests.

Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test. But, of course, we had to start by prioritising patients in hospital, followed by NHS and social care colleagues and by those in care homes.

As we expanded the capacity from just 2,000 tests a day at the start of March, to 10,000 tests a day at the start of this month, so we have been able to further expand access.

Today I can go further. We make it easier, faster and simpler for any essential worker in England who needs a test to get a test.

From today, employers of essential workers will be able to go on GOV.UK to get a test for any of their staff who need a test. And, from tomorrow, any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on GOV.UK themselves directly. This all applies for people in essential workers’ households too who need a test.

It’s all part of getting Britain back on her feet.

Those included as essential workers will be based on the list for schools and education, set out on GOV.UK. The whole process will be free. And, once you’ve entered your details on the website, you’ll get a text or an email inviting you to book an appointment.

After you’ve had your test, results will be sent out by text and a helpdesk will be available to deal with queries. People who can’t go online can still apply through their employer.

I want to make it as easy as possible for people to get a test, not least because we’re talking about people who are ill.

Our network of regional test sites has now reached over 30 locations right across the UK, and more are being set up each day.

And I want to just take this moment to applaud the private companies who have been involved, as well as my team at Public Health England and the NHS: Boots, Amazon, ThermoFisher, Randox, Roche, Oxford Nanopore, GSK and AstraZeneca. They’ve really stepped up to the mark, and I’m grateful to each and every one of them.

We are also introducing home test kits. And, with the support of the armed forces, mobile testing sites too. The armed forces and the MoD have played a vital role here and I’d like to pay tribute to their work.

I thought, at yesterday’s briefing, General Sir Nick Carter when he said that coronavirus had presented the single greatest logistical challenge in his 40 years of service, I thought that spoke a truth. Our armed forces have played their part in rising to this challenge and want to thank them all.

In addition to testing essential workers, we are using testing to find out how many people have coronavirus. And how many people have had coronavirus.

These are critical pieces of information to inform our battle against this novel virus, and that we’ll use to learn, and we keep learning about every day.

This week we have begun one of the biggest virus infection and antibody studies that this country has ever seen.

This is a joint project, with the Office for National Statistics bringing their experience of running large household surveys and the University of Oxford bringing their world leading scientific expertise.

In total, 25,000 people will take part in the first phase, with plans to expand it to up to around 300,000 people over the next 12 months. Participants will provide regular samples taken from self-administered swabs and answer a few short questions during home visits by trained health workers.

We will use these tests to help us strengthen our scientific understanding and inform us all on the big choices we have to make about social distancing measures and how we start returning to a more normal life.

Letters are arriving on doorsteps from today. Please, if you’re asked, take part in this vital research for your country. The early signs from today are that there is huge enthusiasm from those who have received letters taking part in the survey. If you get a letter, please respond to it as soon as you can because you will be doing your bit.

And, as we ramp up our ability to test in large numbers, and as we slow the spread of the virus, we also need to make sure we’ve got the ability to trace contacts just as effectively.

As we look ahead, this is critical to keep the virus under control. And so we are putting the infrastructure in place now so we can roll out contact tracing on a large scale.

We are currently testing the new NHS contact tracing app. If you become unwell with symptoms of coronavirus, you’ll be able to tell the NHS via this app. The app will then send an alert to other app users that you’ve been in significant contact with in recent days, even before you had the symptoms. So that they know and they can act accordingly, so we can get tests to people even if they are asymptomatic.

If we are worried that they have been in significant contact with someone who has the disease, we’ll be able to let them know.

But it’s not just about the technology. We need the people too. We need to be really kick-starting contact tracing, as the number of cases begin to fall.

We are preparing for this now, by hiring an initial 18,000 people. Including over 3,000 clinicians, including public health specialists. We will be training up the mass ranks of our contact tracers over the coming weeks, and then roll out the service.

This test, track and trace will be vital to stop a second peak of the virus.

But recent weeks have shown that there’s something we can all do. And that is to follow the rules on social distancing.

I am acutely aware of how difficult this has been, and especially as we enter Ramadan – a month that is so special for so many people.

And this Ramadan, so many Muslims who serve our country in the NHS, and in the armed forces, and in so many other ways, will not be sharing the joy of this month as they normally do.

I want to say to all British Muslims, thank you for staying at home. I know how important the daily iftar is. How important communal prayers are at night. And how important the Eid festival is.

Thank you for making major changes to these vital parts of your practice. And I want to say to you all – Ramadan Mubarak. And thank you for your service and citizenship. And thank you for your sacrifice.

This will help so we can, together, emerge from this challenge all the more united, all the more grateful to one another and all the more safe.

We have travelled together too far to go backwards now.

So please stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-04-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-23-april-2020"
"132","Speech","UK Statement for the WTO Trade Policy Review of Zimbabwe","The UK's Ambassador to the WTO and UN in Geneva, Julian Braithwaite, delivered this statement at the WTO Trade Policy Review of Zimbabwe on 30 September 2020.","On behalf of the UK Government, I am pleased to add my welcome to the delegation of Zimbabwe, led by the honourable Dr. David Musabayana, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.

Mr Chairman,

First, the United Kingdom would like to thank Zimbabwe for its timely responses to the written questions submitted in anticipation of this meeting of the Trade Policy Review Body.

The UK is committed to supporting a more prosperous, peaceful and democratic Zimbabwe, a country with significant economic potential and high human capital. We welcomed the Government of Zimbabwe’s commitment to economic and political reforms and hope to see more trade and investment with Zimbabwe in the future. We believe there is notable potential in the renewable energy, agriculture and financial services sectors, sectors with the potential to improve livelihoods and financial inclusion.

Whilst we recognise the challenges caused by external shocks such as Cyclone Idai and now Covid-19, we continue to be deeply concerned by the lack of fundamental reforms. This is leading to the economic crisis that most Zimbabweans are facing today. Inflation has continued rising, with the year on year inflation rate for the month of July 2020 standing at 838%. Extreme poverty has increased and humanitarian needs are rising.

With these challenges in mind the UK, as Zimbabwe’s second largest bilateral development partner, is providing £74m this year of bilateral development assistance to support Zimbabwe’s people, focusing on poverty reduction, humanitarian assistance, standing up for human rights and the rule of law. In addition, the UK has rapidly reprogrammed £21.24m to respond to the outbreak of Covid-19 to ensure vital health services can continue.

Meaningful progress on reforms, along with respect for human rights and the rule of law, are the only way to sustainably deal with Zimbabwe’s underlying challenges, unlock significant investment and bring about a better future for Zimbabwe and its people.

As noted in the reports prepared for this Review, corruption continues to hamper Zimbabwe’s development by capturing public and private resources, distorting economic decision making and undermining governance and accountability. We continue to urge Zimbabwe to guarantee the independence of the Anti-Corruption Commission and the courts and to take the necessary steps to address corruption, and tackle entrenched vested interests and illicit financial flows. Within the mining sector, signing up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, restarting efforts to digitise mining licenses and ensuring compliance with environmental impact assessment requirements, would go some way to restoring the confidence of international investors.

We welcome the Zimbabwe Government’s commitments to resolving outstanding land issues. We encourage Zimbabwe to take credible steps to ensure the viability and security of tenure in the 99 year leases, stop further farm invasions, ensure continued progress on compensation and guarantee respect for court decisions on property rights disputes. Taking these actions on land is critical to unlocking international investment into the agriculture sector in Zimbabwe.

The UK also notes the move towards a fully market-based exchange rate in Zimbabwe. We hope that this can help remove exchange rate distortions that enable rent‑seeking behaviour in the economy and create barriers to international investors repatriating their returns on investment. It is also crucial that Zimbabwe guarantees transparency and fairness in addressing and resolving all legacy debts resulting from the previous exchange policy.

The UK is committed to supporting Zimbabwe’s response to the ongoing energy deficit, including through protecting the poor from climate shocks. Renewable energy is central to climate mitigation and adaptation, and as we approach COP26, the UK urges Zimbabwe to remove barriers to the smooth importation of renewable energy equipment, and continue efforts to improve the enabling environment in the distributed power sector.

Zimbabwe is an important trade partner for the UK. Total trade between our two countries was £285 million in the four quarters to the end of Q1 2020, and the UK was Zimbabwe’s 19th largest export market. The Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the UK and the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) States signed by Zimbabwe in January 2019 will enable duty-free and quota-free access on goods from Zimbabwe into the UK. We understand the Agreement is awaiting completion of the domestication processes. We hope Zimbabwe will complete the necessary processes as soon as possible to ensure that Zimbabwean exports to the UK will not face new or higher tariffs, which would disrupt the horticultural sector in particular. This EPA will establish the long-term basis of trade arrangements between our two countries and provide the certainty our businesses seek in both countries.

Mr. Chairman, the UK’s connections to Zimbabwe are strong, based on shared history and economic ties, including an estimated 20,000 British Nationals living in Zimbabwe and a Zimbabwe diaspora of over 112,000 living in the UK. We remain committed to supporting the people of Zimbabwe, and extend our best wishes to Minister Musabayana and his team for a successful trade policy review.","Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and Julian Braithwaite",2020-09-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-statement-for-the-wto-trade-policy-review-of-zimbabwe"
"133","Speech","UK statement to the Committee on Trade and Development","The UK's Deputy Permanent Representative to the WTO in Geneva, Andy Staines delivered the following statement under the agenda item covering an exchange of views and experiences on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the trade of developing countries","Thank you, Chair, for your opening remarks.

I want to thank you, on behalf of the United Kingdom, for calling this meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development. Let me also take the chance to congratulate you on your recent election as Chair of the Committee.

COVID-19 is the most serious global challenge in a generation. The United Kingdom is concerned that many low and lower middle income countries are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 because of the exposure to international shocks, lack of financial stability and macroeconomic imbalances.

Measures to control the spread of COVID-19 are having a profound impact on global trade and supply chains. These measures will continue to have a significant negative impact on businesses in developing countries.

This potentially jeopardises decades of hard-fought, trade-led prosperity.

That is why the United Kingdom is helping to keep supply chains open and is working to mitigate the immediate impacts of restrictive trade measures in response to the pandemic.
We are pivoting our existing Aid For Trade programmes to work with affected businesses and support developing country Members to make proportionate, evidence-based trade-offs between virus containment and open trade. We are also supporting the protection of key supply chains and trade routes so that essential goods and services, including critical medical and food supplies, can reach the most vulnerable.

Through the UK’s Trade and Investment Advocacy Fund and our funding to the World Bank, we are providing support to eligible developing country Members to better understand the trade-related impacts of COVID-19 on their economies, notify COVID-related measures to the WTO’s monitoring exercise, and tackle the COVID crisis through better trade facilitation.

We must act together to respond to this global pandemic. Developing countries are simultaneously facing a health crisis, a humanitarian crisis and the risk of a protracted economic crisis. This is why the UK is ensuring that the international trade response to COVID-19 through multilateral fora responds to the needs of the most vulnerable countries. The UK therefore welcomes the outcomes agreed at the virtual extraordinary G20 Trade Ministers’ meeting on May 14, including commitments on development and humanitarian aid and we support the ‘Joint Statement on ‘Open Markets, Flow of Essential Goods and Supply Chain Connectivity’ organised through the UN General Assembly.

The WTO also has a major role to play. While we understand the challenges for the organisation in meeting formally, it is still the world’s leading platform for discussing global trade. It is the place where the impact on COVID-19 on the global trading system should be discussed, where ideas and solutions should be shared, and where initiatives to mitigate the global economic crisis to come, launched.

As this crisis evolves, we will continue to work with the WTO and Members on appropriate initiatives supporting free, fair, rules-based trade that is inclusive of developing countries and to ensure crucial supply chains and transport routes remain open for food and medicine.

Developing countries themselves must be leaders in this discussion and the UK welcomes this meeting as a way from which we can work together.

We welcome the High Commissioner’s report.

Two years since President Mnangagwa’s inauguration, the human rights situation in Zimbabwe remains deeply concerning. Journalists, civil society activists, and opposition politicians face targeted arrests, violence and abduction. Accountability for human rights violations is absent. Worryingly, it appears COVID-19 is being used as a pretext to ban demonstrations and limit media freedom. We call on the Government to respect the rights enshrined in the Zimbabwean Constitution.

The protection of civilians in Cameroon remains a concern. While we welcome the Government’s investigation into the events at Ngarbuh in February, we urge accountability for those who violated and abused human rights there, as we do for all such incidents.

We are concerned about restrictions on freedoms of expression and assembly in Vietnam. We call for the better protection of journalists, and for all citizens to have access to free, independent, media.

We remain concerned by the repression of people in Nicaragua who speak out against the government,  as well as restrictions on peaceful assembly, harassment, and arbitrary detentions.

In Belarus, we have been shocked by the violence and human rights violations that have been used to suppress peaceful protest.

Finally, we remain deeply concerned about the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran, and the DPRK, and attacks on freedom of religion or belief and media freedom in many countries.

Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.

I’m joined by Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer, and Professor John Newton, who is our adviser on test and trace.

Before I turn to the latest coronavirus data, I wanted to say something this Mental Health Awareness Week.

I know how difficult the change and uncertainty generated by this awful virus has been for so many people. So many moments of joy have been put on hold. Cherished milestones, important events and time with loved ones - things that were in the diary but can’t any longer.

So I want to say this to anyone who has been finding it hard.These are tough times. It is OK to be not OK. And it is normal to feel low, anxious, or unhappy sometimes.

But it is so important that if you think you need it, please seek help. If you want to talk to someone, please, go to the NHS - it is there for you.

And if you are a health or care worker, there is bespoke series of support so we can care for you just as you care for us - just text FRONTLINE to 85258.

Mental health charities are also offering some brilliant support too. Today I am providing a further 4.2 million pounds so organisations like Samaritans and Young Minds and Mental Health UK can keep on doing what they do best.

Everyone can strengthen their mental health, just in the same way as we keep an eye on our physical health, including when we are healthy.

And PHE’s Every Mind Matters campaign is something that every single person can engage with and can use to strengthen your mental health and wellbeing - in good times and in bad. So let’s all come together this Mental Health Awareness Week and support each other.

Turning to the daily figures…

We have now completed over 3 million tests for coronavirus. In total, 3,090,566 tests have been carried out in the UK, including 128,340 yesterday tests carried out yesterday.

250,908 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,615 cases since yesterday.

9,543 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus. That is a 14% fall from the same time last week.

Sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,042 people have now died. That’s an increase of 338 fatalities since yesterday.

This is a deadly virus and it has brought pain to so many both here and across the world. But we are making real progress in our fight.

I’d like to take a moment to remind everyone about our plan to defeat coronavirus and to get Britain moving once again.

Slide one please.

As you may have seen at previous briefings, we have now put in place our COVID Alert Level System. It consists of 5 levels, based on the R value and the number of new cases.

This alert level guides the social distancing rules, which have proved to be so effective at getting the virus under control. The higher the alert level, the stricter the rules.

Throughout the lockdown, we have been at level 4. As you can see, level 4 means that coronavirus is in general circulation and that transmission is either high or exponentially rising.

But, thanks to your shared sacrifice, we’ve now brought R down. And now, because of our caution, we are in a position to start moving to level 3.

Next slide please.

And here is how we can move forward… We’ve set out 3 steps that we plan to take, carefully, to modify the social distancing rules and start to restore freedom in this country, all the while avoiding a disastrous second peak that could overwhelm the NHS.

At each step, we will closely monitor the impact on R, on the number of new infections and on all available data.

We are currently at step 1, which means:


    if you work but you can’t work from home, you should speak to your employer about going back in
  
  
    you can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like
  
  
    and you can meet one other person from outside your household in an outdoor, public place, but you should stay 2 metres apart
  
We will move to step 2 on 1 June if we are able to do so. Step 2 involves reopening more things, like schools and some retail. And using our test and trace system to keep R down. We will only move to step 2, and then in due course to step 3, when it is safe to do so.

Next slide please.

It is important that we stay alert and think about what we can all do to control the spread of this virus.This means, of course, staying at home as much as is possible and working from home if you can.

It means:


    hygiene: washing your hands and cleaning surfaces remains absolutely crucial
  
  
    distance: staying 2 metres apart wherever possible
  
  
    protection: wearing face coverings on public transport and in shops
  
  
    and self-isolating altogether if you have symptoms
  
And as we approach a bank holiday weekend, we must all renew our efforts. Over the course of this pandemic, people all across the UK have been making difficult but vital sacrifices for the greater good. So let’s not go back to square one.

We can all play our part in the national effort, getting R down and keeping R down, and controlling the virus so we can restore more of the things that make life worth living.

As we follow our plan, our testing regime will be our guiding star. It is the information that helps us to search out, and defeat the virus.

Over the past few months, we have built a critical national infrastructure for testing on a massive scale. We have already put in place the building blocks. We have developed the test, we’ve built the test centres and the lab capacity, we’ve created the home testing kits.

All this gives us clarity and confidence for the long term. We hit 100,000 tests a day on time. When we said we would. But we are always striving to go further.

To expand our testing capacity, and to improve our understanding of this virus, there are 2 developments that I wanted to share with you all today.

The first is around swab tests, these are the results that tell you if you currently have coronavirus. As I announced on Monday, anybody over 5 who has symptoms is now eligible for a test.

Getting the test is important. But getting a quick result is important too. We are working hard on innovative developments that I wanted to bring you up to speed with.

It’s really important to be clear about this. Working with innovative science always has its risks. Like all R&D, lots of the projects don’t come off.

For instance, like vaccines, where we don’t know if we’ll ever get one, I’m prepared to back innovative developments even if they might never happen. And I think it’s worth it, especially in these circumstances, to back things before you know for sure if they’re going to work, and I make no apologies for that.

We are working with many top names to help us deliver testing with a rapid turnaround - names like Oxford Nanopore and Chronomics and DNA Nudge.

For example, one innovative company, Optigene, has produced an early test which is being trialled from today. It is interesting to us because it is so fast. It doesn’t need to be sent to a lab to be processed and so you get the result on the spot, typically within around 20 minutes.

It’s already proven effective in early trials and we want to find out if it will be effective on a larger scale.
And we want to support companies like Optigene, and others, to develop these sort of innovative projects. We will monitor its effectiveness very closely. And if it works, we will roll it out as soon as we can.

Now this is just one of a number of innovative testing technologies that we are pushing forward, as fast as the science allows. I will leave no stone unturned and I want to thank everybody involved for their dedication.

The second development I wanted to share today is around antibody tests. These tell you if you have had the virus and have developed antibodies in response, that might help you to fight the virus in the future.

COVID-19 is a new virus and we are learning more about it every single day. I want to be frank with you about what we don’t know, as well as what we do know. We are not yet in a position to say that those who test positive in these antibody tests are immune from coronavirus.

But as our understanding of the disease improves, the insight these antibody tests provide will be crucial. They can help us to understand how our bodies react to coronavirus, and how it has spread across the country. We are backing efforts to develop our own homegrown antibody tests through our UK Rapid Test Consortium - and that work is showing some early promise.

And as you know, we have been looking at a whole series of commercial antibody tests. Now many of the early tests were not reliable enough for clinical use. But we have made some available at small scale.

And we have now had the results of our antibody surveillance study. This has told us that around 17% of people in London, and around 5% or higher in the rest of the country, have tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.

This was based on a sample. But for the public at large to know whether or not they have had coronavirus, we need antibody tests at large scale.

Two lab-based tests, produced by Roche Diagnostics and Abbott Labs, have been given a positive evaluation by PHE and approved by the MHRA. And 3 further tests are being assessed right now. And I can announce today that we have signed contracts to supply in the coming months, over 10 million tests from Roche and Abbott.

From next week, we will begin rolling these out in a phased way. At first, to health and care staff, patients and residents.

The UK government has arranged supplies of these tests on behalf of the devolved administrations, and each devolved nation is deciding how to use its test allocation and how testing will be prioritised and managed locally. This is an important milestone. And it represents further progress in our national testing programme.

It’s not just about the clinical advances that these tests can bring, although, obviously, that’s important. It’s that knowing you have these antibodies will help us to understand in the future if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, dying from coronavirus and of transmitting coronavirus.

We are developing this critical science, to know the impact of a positive antibody test. And to develop the systems of certification to ensure people who have positive antibodies can be given assurance about what they can safely do.

History has shown that understanding an enemy is fundamental to defeating it. And in this latest fight, our ingenuity and our brilliant scientists and our scientific curiosity is what will keep us one step ahead of this virus.

We all have something to bring though in this fight against our common foe. One action that each and every one of us can take is to follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing. Not just for you, but for your loved ones and for your community.

So please, stay alert, control the virus and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-05-21,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-21-may-2020"

The United Kingdom thanks the Commission for their critical work promoting truth and accountability in South Sudan.  We commend the Government of South Sudan for their cooperation with the Commission and stand ready to support them on delivering human rights improvements.

Despite welcome progress in implementating the 2018 peace deal, we are concerned by: increased violence; continued civilian killings and rapes; recruitment of child combatants; and forced civilian displacement. The Government must address these issues and end the culture of impunity. All parties to the peace deal must meet their commitments on transitional justice and accountability.

We welcome the Commission’s 14 August comments highlighting escalating violence, especially at the sub-national level. The Government has a responsibility to protect its citizens, stop violence and put effective governance arrangements in place. The Government must also investigate sexual violence, support survivors, and take action to prevent further attacks.

We are also concerned by arbitrary detentions and executions, and restrictions to freedom of expression.  We restate our call for investigation and accountability regarding the 2017 death of journalist Christopher Allen. 
Commissioners,

What steps are needed in South Sudan to end the violence, protect civilians and hold those responsible to account?

Thank you Chair.

The United Kingdom welcomes continued discussion on this important issue. While disputes and negotiations might sometimes dominate the headlines, the role of transparency in supporting the WTO’s work is every bit as important.

Transparency brings certainty and predictability to trade. It underpins the process of members monitoring each other’s compliance with the WTO agreements and supports evidence-based negotiations.

That is why the United Kingdom supports and intends to co-sponsor this proposal to improve compliance around transparency and notifications. We see it as a pragmatic response to the challenges that the WTO is facing in this area.

Nonetheless, the United Kingdom is alive to the capacity constraints that some developing members, in particular LDC members, face. That is why we welcome the changes made with respect to LDCs in the latest version of the proposal, and we remain interested in further discussions on mechanisms to provide technical assistance, and notifications guidance, to developing countries who struggle to meet their notification requirements.

In that vein I would recall the announcement I made at the General Council on 15 May, setting out the support the UK is now providing to eligible developing country members to notify COVID-related measures to the WTO’s monitoring exercise, through our Trade and Investment Advocacy Fund.

The United Kingdom looks forward to engaging further with WTO members on this proposal.","Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Department for International Trade, and Julian Braithwaite",2020-06-11,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-statement-to-the-wto-council-for-trade-in-goods-item-7"
"138","Speech","Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 April 2020","Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock gave the 5 April 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Coronavirus press conference: 5 April 2020

Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press conference. I’m joined today by our Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries.

The government is working through our action plan, which aims to save as many lives as possible by slowing the spread of the virus, protecting the NHS and preventing it from being overwhelmed.

Our response is built upon the bedrock of the best possible scientific and medical advice, so that we can take the right steps at the right time.

First, by slowing the spread of the virus across our society. And second, by boosting the capacity of the NHS so that we can always care for those who fall sick. Sadly, coronavirus continues to spread.

I can report that, through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, according to the latest figures:

195,524 people have now been tested for the virus
  and 47,806 have been tested positive
Across the UK, the number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms is now 16,702. And, of those who have contracted the virus, 4,934 have, sadly, died.

We mourn their passing, and we offer our profound sympathies to their family and friends. I have lost 2 people that I was fond of. So I understand what a difficult time this is for the country.

This evening, Her Majesty the Queen will give a rare formal address to the nation. And I know we will all be watching and listening to see and hear what she has to say on behalf of us all.

I understand that people are yearning to know how long this will all last. And the answer is entirely dependent on how much people follow the rules on social distancing.

Following these rules is mission critical if we are to protect the NHS, slow the spread and give the NHS time to expand capacity and so save lives.

The more people follow the rules, then the faster we will all be through it.

So, I say this to the small minority of people who are breaking the rules or pushing the boundaries. You are risking your own life, and the lives of others. And you are making it harder for us all.

We’ve included exercise as one of the things that you can leave your house to do, because exercise is good for our physical and mental health. But, please do not bend or break this rule. We can’t rule out further steps. But, I don’t want anyone to think that any changes to the social distancing rules are imminent, because the vast majority are following the rules.

And to you, to all those at home, to all those following the rules, I want to say thank you, on behalf of us all. And especially on behalf of the doctors and nurses and other colleagues who put their lives on the line to care for you in the NHS. As well as working to slow the spread, of course, we are increasing the capacity of the NHS.

Last week, we saw the completion of the Nightingale Hospital in East London. It was planned, constructed and fully staffed within 9 days. It was humbling to see  the NHS, the military and everyone involved in its construction pulling together in this time of need. And there are many more Nightingales to come across our entire United Kingdom, including Harrogate, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Belfast and Cardiff.

These new hospitals are on top of the expansion in critical care across the NHS. There are currently over 2,336 spare critical care beds for the NHS in England. And over 9,000 ventilators are now available to NHS coronavirus patients across the country, thanks to the national effort to ramp up capacity. 300 new ventilators arrived this weekend from China. And we’ve seen UK manufacturers working at pace to develop new ones.

Of course, hospitals and ventilators are critical, but our NHS is nothing without the people who work there. And it has been so encouraging to see over 27,000 former healthcare professionals signing up to return to the NHS frontline. I want to say a great big thank you to each and every one of you – welcome back. And I hope many more will sign up in the weeks ahead.

This weekend, we have also launched our latest technology – a new coronavirus status checker. It asks people who currently have coronavirus symptoms to share their experiences to help us in our fight against the virus. And it will help make use of this information, which will in turn help us to understand the disease. So we can for instance allocate resources – like oxygen, ventilators and additional staff – to where they are needed most.

Please do your bit, if you currently have symptoms, by going to www.nhs.uk/statuschecker. Because, the more people who use it, then the better informed our response will be. The smart use of data like this and digital technologies is one of the strongest bulwarks that we have against coronavirus. Because new technologies can help us to meet these new threats, and allow us to gain the understanding and the insight that we need to defeat this virus once and for all.

Technology is one piece of the jigsaw, and an important piece. But, ultimately, the strongest weapon in our arsenal is if we join together in tough times and follow the rules that have been put in place. I, like many of you, have young children at home, so I know what a challenge this can be for families. And I really understand how much everyone wants to enjoy the sunny weather. But, the cruel thing about coronavirus is it thrives on the social contact and the human bonds that bring so much to life.

So, we must show our resolve. All the things that we miss right now – going to the pub for a pint with friends, or sitting in the park with a book, or hugging a grandchild – we will have these moments again and they’ll mean even more to us.

But until then, the only way to protect yourselves, your loved ones and your community is to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-04-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-april-2020"
"139","Speech","Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 December 2020","Speech by Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock at the Downing Street coronavirus briefing.","Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.

I’m joined by Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins, the Chief Medical Advisor to Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace.

We all know that 2020 has been a hard year.

And it is ending in this festive period, which is going to be very different.

After all the efforts that we’ve gone through to control this virus, and in many parts of the country, this virus is under control.

Just as we’ve got a tiering system in place that was able to control this virus, we’ve discovered a new, more contagious virus, a variant which is spreading at a dangerous rate.

And I know that the vast majority of people watching today and across the country understand what we need to do together to get through this.

So today we’re announcing further action within the tiering system and also some further progress on vaccines and on testing.

And I just wanted to say this before I set out the details of what we’re going to have to put in place: I know this action has consequences.

And I know how difficult it is.

But I also know that it is right to take the action that is necessary to control this virus.

Across the country, cases have risen 57% in the last week

The average daily COVID hospital admissions are 1,909 a day – that’s the highest figure since mid-April.

There are 18,943 people in hospital right now, that’s almost as many as at the peak.

And yesterday, 691 deaths from coronavirus were reported. That’s 691 people who have died just before Christmas. And our hearts go out to their families and loved ones as with all those that have died from this horrible disease.

I know the pain this causes.

So against this backdrop of rising infections, rising hospitalisations and rising number of people dying from coronavirus, it is absolutely vital that we act.

We simply cannot have the kind of Christmas that we all yearn for.

Of course, it’s the social contact that makes Christmas so special. But it is that social contact that the virus thrives on, and that’s how the virus has spread from one person to another.

So it’s important that we all minimise our social contact as much as is possible this Christmas, and that will help protect ourselves, our loved ones and the whole country.

We’ve got to keep our resolve. We’ve got to keep going through this.

And there are 4 areas of our response that I want to update you on today very specifically.

Local action

The first are those tiering decisions that I’ve just mentioned.

We know that the 3-tiered system worked to control the old variant, and is working now in large parts of the country, especially in Northern England.

But, we also know that Tier 3 is not enough to control the new variant.

That is not a hypothesis, it is a fact, and we’ve seen it on the ground.

We have seen case rates rise in some of places close to where the current Tier 4 restrictions are, in places like East Anglia, where we’ve also detected a significant number of the new variant as we’ve seen case rates rise sharply.

It is therefore necessary to put more of the East and South East of England into Tier 4.

We are also taking action in parts of the South West, where there are some early signs of the new variant, and where cases are rising.

Even though case rates in some of these areas are not as high as in some areas badly affected, in London for instance and in Kent, the direction is clear, and in many cases is quite stark.

The doubling times are short.

And we have learnt that when it’s a matter of when, not if we take action.

It is better to act sooner.

So, from one minute past midnight on Boxing Day, Sussex, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, those parts of Essex not yet in Tier 4, Waverley in Surrey, and Hampshire, including Portsmouth and Southampton, but with the exception of the New Forest, will be escalated to Tier 4.

Bristol, Gloucestershire, Somerset, including the North Somerset Council area, Swindon, the Isle of Wight, New Forest and Northamptonshire, as well as Cheshire and Warrington, will be escalated to Tier 3.

And I’m afraid Cornwall and Herefordshire have seen sharply rising rates and need to be escalated to Tier 2.

This is not news that anybody wants to deliver.

And I am truly sorry for the disruption that it causes.

But I think people know how important it is that we take decisions like this to keep people safe and to protect the NHS.

South Africa

The second piece of new I want to tell you about is developments on another new strain of this virus.

Of course, the fight against this virus is a global effort.

And we are constantly vigilant and looking around the world.

As part of our surveillance, and thanks to the impressive genomic capability of the South Africans, we have detected 2 cases of another new variant of coronavirus here in the UK.

Both are contacts of cases who have travelled from South Africa over the past few weeks.

The Chief Scientific Advisor and Chief Medical Officer and others met their South African counterparts over the last day.

We are incredibly grateful to the South African Government for the rigour of their science, and the openness and the transparency with which they have rightly acted, as we did when we discovered the new variant here.

This new variant is highly concerning, because it is yet more transmissible and it appeared to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered here.

We have taken the following action.

First, we are quarantining cases, and close contacts of cases, found here in the UK.

Second, we are placing immediate restrictions on travel from South Africa.

Finally, and most importantly, anyone in the UK who has been in South Africa in the past fortnight, and anyone who has been in close contact with anyone who has been in South Africa in the last fortnight, must quarantine immediately.

By quarantine, I mean they must restrict all contact with any other person whatsoever.

We will be changing the law to give this legal effect imminently.

These measures are temporary, while we investigate this further new strain, which is currently being analysed at Porton Down.

And I want to thank everyone involved for the seriousness with which I know they will take these instructions.

Testing

I’d like to now move onto some more positive developments.

The third thing I wanted to talk about was an update on testing.

As you know, we continue rapidly to expand testing capacity here in the UK.

We are expanding community testing yet further in areas where the rate of infection is highest

So we can identify people, and especially to identify the around 1 in 3 people, who carry the virus without displaying any symptoms at all.

116 local areas have now signed up for this community testing, and we are in discussion with more.

These rapid turnaround tests are proving to be extremely effective at finding cases where we otherwise wouldn’t.

And I am today publishing an assessment of the Liverpool community testing project, which shows how effective this can be.

I would urge anyone who has the opportunity to take part to protect their local area.

And at the same time we are boosting rapid testing in care homes, with a further £149 million to support that effort.

So all those who work in care homes in England will receive 2 rapid tests a week, in addition to their weekly PCR test.

Vaccines

Finally, amid all this difficulty, the great hope for 2021 is of course the vaccine.

The vaccine is our route out of all this.

And, however tough this Christmas and this winter is going to be, we know that the transforming force of science is helping find a way through.

I am delighted to be able to announce that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, developed here in the UK, has submitted its full data package to the MHRA for approval.

This is the next step towards a decision on the deployment of the vaccine, which is already being manufactured including here in the UK.

We are, of course, continuing to deploy the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which is being delivered now from over 500 sites all across the UK, and we are adding more all of the time and we are accelerating the rollout.

I am also delighted to be able to announce that we have begun vaccination in care homes.

We know that people who live in care homes are amongst those most vulnerable to this disease, and I’m delighted that we’re able to do this. It is another enormous logistical challenge, and I am very grateful to colleagues in the NHS and social care sector, who have worked so hard together to make this happen.

This afternoon, it gives me great joy to tell you that the Chelsea Pensioners will be vaccinated, along with care home residents right across the country.

I think we all need a bit of good news.

And the reality is this vaccine programme is the we are going to get this.

Because every time someone is vaccinated, our country becomes a little bit safer, they become a little bit safer and we get a little bit closer to the life that we all want to get back to.

Achievements this year

As I sincerely hope this is my last press conference before Christmas.

I want to take a moment firstly to thank you, and everyone watching, for the sacrifices you’ve made.

And I want to thank my whole team, who have done so much, including those here, including Susan and Jenny, but including the huge team in the NHS, in the Department and right across the board.

As a country, we have been faced with the most enormous challenges, and it has been very tough.

But I especially want to thank those who help this country to become the first in the world to roll out a clinically approved vaccine.

I want to thank all those that have helped us build a bigger capacity genomic testing than anywhere else in the world – and of course the biggest testing capacity in Europe.

I want to thank our scientist who discovered the first proven treatment for coronavirus.

And I want to thank everybody working in the NHS and in social care for the work that they’ve done this year, and also for the work that’s going to carry on this winter.

And especially to colleagues are going to work over Christmas, which of course is so important in the NHS and in social care.

Look, I know how hard 2020 has been for everybody.

And after delivering some really difficult news, if I may I want to end on a reflection about where we are as a country.

This Christmas, and the start of 2021, is going to be tough.

The new variant makes everything much harder, because it spreads so much faster.

But we mustn’t give up now. We know that we can control this virus, we know that we can get through this together.

We’re going to get through it by suppressing the virus, until a vaccine can make us safe, and that has been our strategy and that’s what we must do.

And I know that we can do this. We’ve seen so much sacrifice.

We’re not going to give up now, especially after so much sacrifice.

I know that some of these decisions are tough.

But I believe that everybody making the right decisions, and I believe that everybody will do what is needed to keep themselves and others safe, especially this Christmas.

And I know from the bottom of my heart that there are brighter skies ahead.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-12-23,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-on-coronavirus-restriction-tiers-vaccines-and-testing"
"140","Speech","UK statement to the WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment","The UK's Ambassador to the WTO and UN in Geneva, Julian Braithwaite, delivered this statement at a meeting of the WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment on 3 July 2020.","The UK is pleased to be able to provide an update to the Committee on planning for the COP26 UN climate conference.

On 28th May, the Bureau of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), with the UK and its Italian partners, agreed new dates for the COP26 UN climate conference, which will now take place between 1 and 12 November 2021 in Glasgow. As COP president, together with our partner Italy, we see this as a crucial moment for the world to come together and commit to a climate resilient, zero carbon economy. This means more ambition to reduce emissions, more ambition to build resilience, and more ambition to cooperate and support one another.

In the wake of COVID-19, we need action through multilateral institutions – including the WTO - to support a clean, inclusive and resilient recovery that builds on the principles of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Despite the pandemic, the UK’s commitment to urgent climate action has not wavered. As we work to protect our citizens and repair our economies, we must also act on climate change, and meet these two joint challenges together. In fact, coronavirus has provided a stark reminder of what happens when humanity’s relationship with nature breaks down. As we recover, we have an opportunity to build back better in every sense. We must use this opportunity to protect and restore nature, whilst reducing our exposure to deadly viruses and climate impacts.

Our overarching goal at COP26 is to raise ambition at the country level. While we recognise the constraints that many countries are facing in light of the ongoing pandemic, we encourage all countries to make every effort to come forward as soon as possible, and well ahead of COP26, with more ambitious NDCs and long-term strategies. Coming out of COP25, the Climate Ambition Alliance has brought together countries, businesses, investors and other institutions committed to reaching net zero by 2050. The UK recently launched the ‘Race to Zero’ campaign to build on this success and to encourage others to make the same commitment.

The Committee on Trade and Environment is the place to bring together objectives on trade liberalisation and climate ambition and to ensure that these are mutually enabling. We want to see this CTE do this by facilitating discussions on how to remove barriers to trade in environmental goods and services, encouraging innovation in the low-carbon and circular economies, and ensuring transparency in relevant policies and regulations. We look forward to working with the Secretariat and Members on achieving those goals.","Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Department for International Trade, and Julian Braithwaite",2020-07-03,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-statement-to-the-wto-committee-on-trade-and-the-environment"
"141","Speech","Responding to COVID-19 and supporting fair elections in Somalia","Statement by Ambassador Jonathan Allen at the Security Council briefing on Somalia","Thank you, Mr President. Let me, if I might, thank our briefers – of course, to SRSG Swan and, if I might, to you as well, Jim commend your relentless professionalism and commitment in difficult circumstances. I also want to thank Ambassador Madeira and Director Marcaillou.

Mr President, in light of COVID-19, let me start by expressing our solidarity with Somalia in facing this global pandemic and commend Somalia for the measures they have taken to contain the spread of the virus. I also want to welcome the work of the United Nations in coordinating a coherent response between international organisations including the WFP, WHO, UNICEF and NGO partners.

We want to urge all partners to respond to Somalia’s COVID-19 Response Plan which calls for additional, aligned and coordinated funding. The United Kingdom gave $420 million in the last financial year to Somalia and in light of the response plan we are considering now what more we can do. And I would also just like to mention that today, the UK has announced a $25 million contribution to the African Union Fund, set up last month by President Ramaphosa to tackle COVID-19.

Mr President, despite the pandemic and the Secretary-General’s calls for a ceasefire, Al-Shabaab continues to launch attacks. We strongly condemn the recent attacks in Mogadishu, including against the UN, AMISOM and the international community. And I want to pay tribute to the ongoing commitment and sacrifices of AMISOM troop contributing countries and the efforts of the Somali Security Forces. I want to join UNMAS in their concern about the use of IEDs in Somalia. This is why this Council imposed a ban on IED components and it’s why we have recommended strengthening support on tackling IEDs in the AMISOM text.

Mr President, it is clear that COVID-19 poses significant challenges to Somalia. We need to recognise this. That this should not distract us from supporting Somalia to make the gains made and supporting Somalia on making progress on security, greater political engagement and elections.

On security reform, there has been important progress over the last year. Somalia has recovered additional territory from Al-Shabaab, trained Somali security forces, developed a threat assessment; and become a member of INTERPOL. There is now greater international engagement on the question of what security support in Somalia will look like after 2021. In March the UK supported a Wilton Park-convened conference in Ethiopia. In April the African Union and Somalia chaired a ministerial conference. We should build on this momentum.

Somalia has also started the process of updating the Somali Transition Plan. Rapid progress in updating and, above all, implementing the Transition Plan is vital if Somalia is to meet their own December 2021 deadline to take over lead responsibility for national security. The independent assessment, requested by this Council, will help us decide how best to support Somalia’s vision post-2021. Both the revised security strategy and the independent review should guide our decision making in a timely fashion.

Mr President, the long-term goals of a Somali political settlement, including One-Person-One-Vote elections and progress on the constitutional review, remain unchanged. We are seeing progress on technical preparations for elections and we welcome the UN’s efforts to enable Parliament to reconvene virtually and AMISOM’s support on security.  It is vital that the Government, Parliament, Electoral Committee, Joint Parliamentary Committee, and Federal Member States work together and take urgent and inclusive steps to help facilitate timely, constitutional and inclusive One-Person-One-Vote elections.

There is no reason why COVID-19 should prevent the key preparatory work from taking place. This is the time for government and opposition to put aside differences and find compromise. Decisions on the electoral code, seat allocation, definition of constituencies, women’s quota and provisions for Somaliland and Benadir are needed urgently, and it is good to hear that we should see progress on these issues in the next few weeks.

Mr President, I want to express deep concern about recent actions taken to repress the media with arrests of journalists in Somalia. We welcome the recent positive steps to facilitate accurate reporting on COVID-19 by the Office of the Prime Minister. The media has a vital role to play in Somalia. We call for Somali journalists to be able to perform their work and we call also on Somali leaders to ensure the political space is kept open.

Mr President, reconciliation is central to Somalia’s state-building efforts. There has been some progress in Jubaland, South West State and Galmudug, but critical issues remain. We look to the Federal Government to drive forward reconciliation efforts and we need to see high-level political dialogue with the Federal Member States. This dialogue was urgent before and is even more urgent in the light of COVID-19. There is no room for division in the face of a common enemy.

In conclusion, Mr President, let me emphasise three points.

First, the importance of an enhanced and coordinated response to supporting Somalia in its fight against COVID-19. We should all do what we can.

Second, the importance of this Council, the United Nations, the region, the AU and the wider international community in continuing to support Somalia to achieve progress on holding timely One-Person-One-Vote elections and moving ahead on security reform. Somalia’s future security and development depends on continued progress.

And finally, I reiterate our call, the call that the Council has made many times, for the Federal Government and Federal Member States to work together to build a stronger and more peaceful Somalia.

Thank you, Mr President.","Foreign & Commonwealth Office and Jonathan Allen",2020-05-21,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/responding-to-covid-19-and-supporting-fair-elections-in-somalia"
"142","Speech","UK statement to the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees High Level Meeting","The UK's Ambassador to the WTO and UN in Geneva, Julian Braithwaite, delivered this statement at the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees High Level Meeting on 6 July 2020.","High Commissioner, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,

Let me start by welcoming the Support Platforms launched at the Global Refugee Forum, including the regional platforms for Afghan Refugees.  We are interested in the Core Group of States, and wish to hear further about the role they will play and the proposed timeline. We are willing to offer our political and facilitation support.

We note that the Solution Strategy for Afghan Refugees will support the voluntary repatriation of Afghan refugees, which must be done in conditions of dignity and safety.  It is essential that any process outlines the favourable conditions for returns, including economic opportunity, security, and access to health and education, and assesses that these have been met. The challenging context of the Covid-19 pandemic has worsened the situation for Afghan refugees and host communities alike.

The UK is committed to supporting the voluntary, safe and dignified return of Afghan refugees from Iran and Pakistan to Afghanistan. We welcome the work that UNHCR is doing in those countries to support host governments and continue to provide substantial support through IOM, to offer registration and assistance for the most vulnerable portion of those returning from Iran and Pakistan. The UK is one of the only countries providing resettlement opportunities to Afghan migrants from Iran this year, hoping to resettle up to 100 refugees.

We welcome the essential work that UNHCR and international non-governmental organisations, including Relief International and the Norwegian Refugee Council, are doing with the Iranian authorities to ensure the resilience of vulnerable Afghan communities. We appreciate the support that the Government of Iran provides to its Afghan community, and are open to exploring opportunities for assistance.

We recognise the willingness of the Governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to co-operate on the orderly, voluntary and principled return of Afghan refugees for whom repatriation to Afghanistan is a viable option. In line with the aims of the regional platform, UK assistance to Pakistan is helping deliver education to host and refugee children alike.

The UK has invested in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in Khyber Pakhthunkwa, working with host and migrant populations to ensure that all children can be immunised. We harmonised this with our polio programme in Afghanistan to ensure that all children in both countries, and those moving between them, are immunised. We also sought to establish vaccination sites in areas that migrant Afghans are known to travel through. Our polio campaigns have been paused due to COVID-19, but we hope they will be resumed shortly.

The UK remains strongly committed to Afghanistan, proving £210 million in humanitarian assistance over a five year period to 2024. In the long-term, this will help to establish conducive conditions for returns by supporting resilience for returnees and displaced people at the community level, as well as targeting those areas of the country with the greatest potential for high numbers of returns from Iran and Pakistan.

"143","Speech","UK statement on the WTO Joint Initiative on Services Domestic Regulation","The UK's Ambassador to the WTO and UN in Geneva, Julian Braithwaite, delivered this statement at a meeting for the Joint Initiative on Services Domestic Regulation on 5 June 2020. This meeting was convened by the Australian Permanent Representative to the WTO, Ambassador Frances Lisson.","Thank you Frances, good morning to you and colleagues, and thank you for convening today’s meeting.

First of all, I would like to congratulate Jaime and colleagues for the progress that has already been made in this Initiative.  We have got very close to agreement.

COVID-19 has been a challenge for the WTO, as it has been for other multilateral institutions.  But COVID-19 makes it even more urgent to make progress on this initiative, and its goal of liberalising global Services trade.  Success here will show the relevance of the WTO, and how it can help the world overcome the economic crisis we are now going through.  It will also reinforce an open, and predictable global trading system, something that come under further threat during this COVID-19 crisis.

In response to your questions:

The UK priority is that the Initiative should deliver a timely and meaningful outcome, with as much ambition as possible. We are therefore keen to consolidate progress on outstanding issues by the end of this year, and reach a finalised text well before a rescheduled MC12.  What a positive message it would send if we could announce an agreement at the special General Council later this year.

To that end, we support finding ways of keeping up the momentum, and getting back to open and fully inclusive negotiations as soon as possible.  We look forward to the meeting on the 16th.  In addition, now that the Swiss authorities are permitting physical meetings, of up to 300 people, from tomorrow, we think it should be possible for the WTO to support resuming physical meetings soon in line with Swiss health guidance.  We think the Initiative should seek to take advantage of these developments, if colleagues here are ready and agree to this step, and hold hybrid physical meetings before the summer.

The United Kingdom will continue to do all it can do ensure that this Initiative reaches a successful conclusion.

Thank you Frances.","Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Department for International Trade, and Julian Braithwaite",2020-06-05,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-statement-on-the-wto-joint-initiative-on-services-domestic-regulation"
"144","Speech","Speech to NHS Providers","The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care thanked the NHS for its hard work and set out the government's commitment to supporting the NHS for the future.","Good afternoon.

I’m very glad to have the chance to talk to you today. Because we are at a perilous moment in the course of this pandemic.

I am very worried about the growth in the number of cases, especially in the North West and North East of England, and parts of Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and parts of Yorkshire.

You have all had the most extraordinary 9 months, and in my view you have risen to the challenge.

But in parts of the country, the situation is again becoming very serious.

Hospitalisations in the North West are doubling approximately every fortnight.

And have risen by 57% in just the just last week alone.

Unfortunately, we are seeing hospitalisations of the over 60s rising sharply, and the number of deaths from coronavirus also rising.

And we know from bitter experience that the more coronavirus spreads, the harder it is to do all the other vital work of the NHS.

Yesterday, we heard from the Academy of Royal Colleges.

Helen Stokes-Lampard said: “If we don’t act fast we risk the NHS being overwhelmed and risk all the good work done to restore services.”

And then this morning, we heard from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine.

When Katherine Henderson said: “If we do not come together and take effective precautions, COVID will continue its explosion across the country, the consequences of which could be the implosion of the NHS this winter.”

The message to the public must be that we all have a part to play, to control this virus.

Our strategy is simple: suppress the virus, supporting the economy, education and the NHS, until a vaccine can make us safe.

My message to you, and to everyone who works in the NHS, is that we can, and we will, get through this.

Sadly, there will be more difficult times ahead.

But we will get through it together.

And one of the good things that has happened this year, and there have been some good things, is that the whole public, has shown just how much it appreciates the NHS.

There’s only one organisation that can inspire people to applaud from their doorsteps and balconies, come rain or shine.

That can inspire colourful support in windows across the land.

There’s only one organisation that can inspire a heroic centenarian to walk laps of his garden and inspire millions of people to sponsor him.

The NHS. The best gift a nation ever gave itself.

And this year, when all nations faced peril and adversity, the NHS was there for us, as it always is, and always must be.

The spontaneous outpouring of admiration that we have seen from all corners of this country, I think that is testament to how much people cherish this amazing institution.

We all pulled together to protect the NHS.

But crucially, it’s the NHS that protects us all.

Not just the doctors and nurses, and I want to say this very directly, but the cleaners, porters, mental health teams, ambulances, and all the diverse and varied parts of this incredible system.

During the greatest public health crisis in a generation, you have been the linchpin of our national effort.

And we must work together for the population who we serve, through this pandemic and beyond.

Today I want to say a few words about how.

People

First of all, of course, the NHS is only as good as its people.

And if the last few months have shown us anything it is that the NHS is blessed with exceptional people.

And we are doing everything in our power to support them, and boost their number.

During the crisis, we put out a call for former health and care professionals to return to the front line – and 47,000 volunteered to play their part.

I think this is an incredible testament. To them, and to every single one of our 1.4 million strong team – and the over 2 million in social care – I want to say, on behalf of the nation, thank you. Thank you for your service.

Our returnees were supported by people from all walks of life who stepped up.

Furloughed cabin crew redeployed into call handling roles.

Clinically trained firefighters provided surge capacity for our ambulance services.

Volunteers delivered hot food to the vulnerable, and to NHS staff.

This was a phenomenal effort from so many, new recruits and established colleagues.

And we all learned just how flexibly we can work when needs must. This sort of flexibility helped the NHS really deliver, and it is something we should hold onto for the future.

And, of course, we are looking to expand the workforce for the long term, through our plans to recruit 50,000 more nurses, and more clinical staff.

This work is bearing fruit.

This year we have seen doctors numbers at their highest ever.

And over the last year, we’ve seen the number of nurses increase by over 14,000.

And we owe it to them, and all our NHS colleagues, to take forward some of the positive changes that we’ve seen during this pandemic.

From my point of view I’ve seen that the white heat of the crisis showed us a lot about our health service.

And for me, what was most illuminating was to see how some of the things that I know frustrate you all.

Like some of the bureaucracy and the hierarchy that too often gets in the way of caring for patients.

How a lot of this melted away.

Of course, it is important that we have the guide rails so we can measure performance and hold ourselves to the highest standards.

But in a health and social care system like ours, that has evolved over the course of over 70 years.

It is easy for layers of overlapping and disproportionate bureaucracy to build up over time.

I hear from providers what this can mean on the ground – multiple requests for information that don’t add value.

Multiple layers of instruction when we need to devolve trust.

Not enough support for the frontline staff who are doing a really stressful job.

So, we must learn from this illumination.

We must look at every rule and process afresh, and ask whether it makes sense after what we’ve learnt from the pandemic.

And we must increase our support to the frontline.

A few months ago, I launched our Red Tape Challenge within the NHS and social care, inviting views from colleagues on how we could bust bureaucracy.

How we could free up our colleagues’ time to focus on what matters – giving care.

And our team has been interviewing people from across the system.

And we have received hundreds of submissions directly from staff, with over 1,000 suggestions of where things could be improved.

The responses themselves have been illuminating.

As one frontline member of staff told us: “All of a sudden we could do everything we needed to do quickly and efficiently because of COVID.”

And that: “We have coped fine without endless meetings and forms.”

Hallelujah.

I can hear lots of you relating back to seeing the same experience.

We also heard from providers that they welcome the ability to act with more flexibility – for example, greater freedom around redeploying staff and contracting.

And I heard, too, of the multiple reports that have proposed reduced bureaucracy in the past, but haven’t been acted on.

Many times I was told that this question has been asked and then nothing has been done about it.

So we will act on the suggestions we’ve heard.

We will act on the recommendations of the reports that have already charted the way, but been left to one side over the past decade.

I want to keep this momentum going, working with you with the goal of making it easier for you to do your jobs.

So that we build a better health service, ultimately for our patients and for our colleagues on the front line to deliver care.

Now, I know how difficult these past few months have been for so many.

And the survey published by NHS Providers this week showed that many colleagues are feeling tired and burnt out.

Believe me, I get it. I want to do everything I can.

The People Plan has already set out our commitment to investing in health and wellbeing in the future.

Through increased flexible working.

Through creating an inclusive and diverse workplace. That’s a culture change that we know we need to see.

And through boosting opportunities for education and training.

And today I can announce a new research project to understand and address the impact of this pandemic on our NHS staff.

Researchers will work across England to identify those most in risk, and most in need of tailored support.

And we will place a particular focus on colleagues from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, who we know, tragically, have been particularly affected by this virus.

There is more to do.

And I pledge, every day, that I will do whatever it takes to protect the people who do so much every day to protect us.

Systems

The next thing I want to turn to, is how we make sure the systems work as well as possible. Even if people are healthy and happy, they can’t perform at their best if the system isn’t set up to support them.

No one designing the NHS would set it up in the way it is set up now.

A system where primary care, community care, pharmacies, mental health trusts, and many, many, other parts, exist – at least in law – as atomised and isolated institutions.

No. A collaborative approach is essential for us to have better, less fragmented decision-making.

To treat complex conditions better.

And to provide the best care for everyone who needs it, in the setting that is best for them.

And to provide preventative care to keep people healthy in the first place.

Now, I don’t believe in reorganisations designed in Whitehall offices, based on management consultants’ spreadsheets.

I am allergic to all that. It is my job to improve the system we’ve got so it works better for everyone. It is the hard yards of incremental reform.

In fact, it’s every single person’s job to improve their part of the system, so that it works better for everyone.

All 1.4 million of us ought to be working together to improve the system that we’ve got.

I know there is a strong and growing consensus behind the systems-led approach.

Streamlining work by bringing together commissioners, providers and local authorities, to plan services for the populations we serve.

And we will move to the system by default. We will remove barriers that prevent collaboration, and follow the approach set out in the Long-Term Plan.

We will improve, rework, join up and tie systems together so we can all focus on the people that matter: the populations we serve.

When battling coronavirus, we have been able to solve problems together at a systems level that previously would have been impossible to crack.

We will deliver ICSs in all geographies by April, and take them further still.

We will strengthen how systems operate, across all parts of the NHS, and tie in tightly with local authority colleagues who share our mission to the populations we serve.

So bringing to bear the whole wealth and diversity of experience that exists in a local area.

All with the shared goal of helping people to live healthier lives for longer.

Recovery

We must make these improvements, even while we battle coronavirus, because they will help us to battle coronavirus.

And we must learn from how we have battled coronavirus.

And we’ve got to recognise the Herculean efforts, both to keep services going, and to get us ready for winter.

And I want to touch on what I think is a seldom-discussed success during this pandemic, which was just how much urgent non-COVID work we were able to keep going at the peak.

As well as treating COVID , cancer treatments continued at 82% of usual levels between March and July.

Our A&Es stayed open.

Primary care and outpatients switched to telemedicine faster than I could ever possibly have imagined.

It has been a phenomenal team effort and I would like to thank and pay tribute to everyone who has been involved.

Not just to those who maintained and delivered the services, but everyone who created the infrastructure – including that digital infrastructure – that made it possible.

We will keep doing everything we can to keep non-COVID treatments and diagnostics going over the next few months.

And the more coronavirus is under control, the more we can continue the recovery and keep essential services open.

As we prepare for the tough months ahead, I have no doubt that we will see the same dedication and care that we have seen all the way through 2020 – the NHS’s most challenged year.

Conclusion

And I pledge you this:

This year has proved beyond measure the importance of our nation’s most cherished institution.

At our best moments in our lives, and at some of our worst.

The NHS is always there for all of us.

And at a time when it is being tested like never before, for this pandemic and into the future, it will be always at your side.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-10-08,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-to-nhs-providers"
"145","Speech","Biometrics Commissioner’s address to the Westminster Forum: 5 May 2020","Address given by Paul Wiles, Biometrics Commissioner, to the Westminster Forum.","In January this year I wrote my last annual report as commissioner on the use of biometrics for policing.  When it was finished, I sent it to the Home Secretary and I am waiting for her to publish it, as she is required to do by laying it before Parliament.   As I was writing that report, I was aware of the emergence of a new virus in China but not that it would become a global pandemic.  Many commentators have made the point that when we eventually come out of this emergency the world that emerges may not be as it was before - that the effects of coronavirus (COVID-19) will lead to some enduring change.  That there will be a new ‘normal’. However, there is much less agreement about how it will be different.

When I wrote my report, I was largely looking back and reporting on the police use of biometrics in the previous year.  There was an exception to that in a section where I addressed the issue of the emergence of new biometrics and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven analytics on which they depend and whether, if they are used in policing, that should require new legislation to provide a governance framework?  Those comments were made in a world that has since been turned upside down by coronavirus.  My term of office comes to an end in mid-June and since this will probably be my final speech as Commissioner, I thought that I would try and address the question of whether the points that I made then about the need for new legislation are still applicable now?

The legislation governing the police use of biometrics is the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, but it only governs DNA and fingerprints because, whilst at that time the possibility of other biometrics was known, there was scepticism as to whether they would become reliable enough to the deployed in policing.  Since that legislation was passed, the situation has been transformed by the growth of AI analytics and the availability of very large data sets for their development.  Facial and voice matching has improved significantly, and trials of their use are being conducted.  This rapid growth of both AI and biometrics has meant their use is being widely explored across both the public and private sectors, although mainly outside of policing.  Whatever the post coronavirus world looks like, the one thing that I am certain of, is that these new technologies will play an important role in shaping that future world.   Consequently, the new technologies are now part of high politics across government and not just a niche issue for policing and the Home Office, although the police use of technology will always require particular attention.

In January I concluded my discussion of the new technologies with a point that I was cautious about making.  It was that decisions about the use and governance of AI analytics and biometrics involved a politically strategic choice about what kind of future social and political world we wanted to create.   I did so because it was clear to me that the new technologies had widespread (possible) application across almost every aspect of society to the point that, whether we liked it or not, they would result in a major disruption of our world, perhaps of an order like those wrought by past major technological changes.  The technologies are going to lead to a new social and political framing of the world we will live in and they may even be the basis for re-building our economy, if it emerges badly damaged from the pandemic.  The emergency is also illustrating the fact that the new technologies themselves will not determine the nature our future world - there is no necessary technological determinism, driven either by God or mammon.  Our world will be the product of the decisions that we make about how we use the new technologies.  That is progress because in January I still felt that it was necessary to argue against such determinism and for the need to make political choices.

I pointed to the example of China as a country that had already made its strategic political choice and was actively seeking a technological lead in this area as a basis to develop its global power and influence.  The Chinese choice is to use the technologies for a new and previously unattainable form of social control over both the lives and thinking of their citizens.  My caution was because I knew I could be accused of shroud waving and inviting the response that we were not China and would not make the same choices.  But that misses the point which is that if we do not want to create a future in the image of China then we need to decide what kind of future do we want to create?

I feel less cautious in making that claim now because the pandemic has underlined the point.  China has demonstrated how effective their technical means of control can be and also how it raises opposition and how brutal the response to such doubts will need to be.

In this country concerns have been raised that the new technologies should not be deployed without a proper consideration of their operating model and whether that sustains our civil liberties.  There is also a debate as to how to distinguish what uses of the new technologies may be acceptable in an emergency and how we ensure different judgements apply once the emergency has abated.  Parliament recognised the problem in its debates of the emergency coronavirus Act, by insisting that its application be time-limited, and that any extension should be approved by Parliament.  In so far as the Act made emergency changes in the retention of biometric profiles by the police, my Office will have to make a report on the consequences of those changes before Parliament considers any extension.

Different uses of the new technology have emerged out of a series of separate pragmatic decision from government and the private sector.  So far, continuing with that approach has seemed to be the preferred method of the government, encouraged by a muted public response to current uses of the technologies.  However, the extent of public concern has been growing.

In past examples of such major transformations, laissez faire pragmatism quite quickly had to be governed by public decision making in order to guide the society legislators wished to see.  We must be careful, of course, that regulation does not stifle innovation or limit other aspect of freedom, such as the freedom to pursue knowledge. The practical problem is how we choose the right balance in our approach.

Liberties are a touch stone but how should our concern for liberty be used in developing a vision of our new ‘normal’?

In trying to address that question My first point in January was that the new technologies are developing at a speed that politics, government and legislation has not kept up with.   That remains the case and indeed has been knocked further back by the current emergency.  Even though not all of government is dealing directly with coronavirus, it seems to have paralysed other thinking, as the Brexit debate did for the years before.

At the same time, the search for solutions to coronavirus is pushing the new technologies even faster, whether that be vaccine development or case tracking by mobile phones.  If the new technologies are to be part of our future, then we also need some proper thinking about their governance.

My second point was that we have failed to develop properly rigorous methods for trialling and evaluating the new technologies before deploying them.  I was talking about trialling new technologies for policing but the same could be said more generally.  There is a danger that instead of choosing how to deploy new technologies based on evidence, we fall under the spell of technical wizardry as providing easy solutions to problems.

During the current crisis there has been an admirable determination to conduct proper trials of vaccine and medical therapeutics, even if at break neck speed.  Proper trials methodology is well embedded into medical science and its governance but not in many other areas.

Each other area of application - for example policing - needs a standard trials methodology.  Unless we have proper trials we run the risk of deploying technologies that have unforeseen or even harmful effects, or that we fail to develop the necessary decision making framework for their successful use, or that they are less effective and more costly than existing solutions, or in some cases simply do not work and so lead to embarrassing reversals.

We must address the fact that claims made by technology developers, perhaps in good faith based on their evaluations, may not be replicable when their technologies are used in real world applications. The point is not one of hostility to developers or to dampen technical development but to extend the development process into the application phrase with rigour.  There is a debate to be had as to whether developers should engage in this application evaluation and not just finish with a limited demonstration.  That is what happens in medicine.

My third point was that not all applications of the new technologies will be in the public interest to deploy.   This a more controversial point in that we may have different views as to how we should make judgements as to which technologies it is acceptable to deploy.  My report was about policing and I argued that we should resolve such differences by applying a public interest test.

In other words, that we should determine, based on the best evidence available to us, how far a use-case would bring public benefit (rather than benefits to a particular, partial or commercial interest).  The reason I hold this view is that biometrics depend on analytics that often use data about individuals and sometimes reveal very personal aspects of our biological being or social behaviour.

This means that some uses of the new technology will intrude into individual rights, including but not limited to, the right to respect a person’s privacy.   Such intrusion can only be justified on the basis that it brings other, more general benefits, that outweigh these disadvantages.  In other words, intrusions into individual rights must be balanced against a wider public interest: what lawyers refer to as ‘proportionality’.  Such an approach is well established in policy making and public law, at least in western democracies. It is reflected in trans-national governance such as the European Convention on Human Rights.  We already have a framework for thinking about proportionality.  Proportionality judgements are always made in context as we respond to a changing world and that is why decisions made in this emergency must be re-visited once it is over and not be allowed to drift into a different context.

This does not mean that I think that the new technologies can only ever be deployed if they are in the public interest.  There will be situations in which it is reasonable to allow use for private or commercial interests but again proportionality tests should still apply.  How such cases are identified and in which governance is something that our legislators will have to grapple.  The issue is already firmly on the political agenda in many countries, because of concerns about the use being made of individual data holdings by tech-based companies, and legislators are under pressure to provide a governance framework.

My fourth point was that by their very nature, public interest tests can’t be made by a partial or vested interest.  Whilst groups may work to develop their own governance arrangements - the police service, for example, are doing so - they will risk foregoing public trust if they are viewed as being partially or self-interested no matter how high minded and lawfully, they operate. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has talked of this danger in recent speeches.

Groups are likely to achieve public trust if they reflect or implement general propositions taken by a public body determining the public interest, whether that is Parliament or the courts declaiming public law.   The same general point, it seems to me, will apply to what governance Parliament decides is appropriate for the use of the new technologies by the private sector.

Trust will be central in future to the deployment of new technologies as it always has been and once lost can be difficult to re-gain. The present crisis has demonstrated just how important public trust is for a government trying to manage an emergency.  When the emergency is over and we come to re-examine our national threat assessment and our planned responses, as we surely will, then the government will need to address the best way to maintain public trust in an emergency just as much as how they best use scientific advice.

My fifth point was public interest tests ought to be informed by the sentiment of the public, but that sentiment is not best read from simple public opinion surveys, although methodologically more sophisticated work may have a part to play.

For citizens to reach an informed view they need to be informed by a public debate - the sentiment of the public should be formed based on such evidence and reasoning.  This public debate ought to be instigated, if not led, by ministers.  To date this has been largely missing and if government wants a future which makes significant use of AI and biometrics, ministers will need to persuade the public that it is their interests to do so and they have put clear governance in place to prevent abuse.

My final point was that public interest tests need to be made by a public body that has legitimacy to do so and ultimately that means by Parliament. That means that we will need fresh parliamentary legislation to govern the police use of new biometrics beyond DNA and fingerprints.  The present government gave a manifesto commitment to do this which appears to change the approach adopted by the previous administration. The lessons of the current pandemic make it obvious that legislation creating governance for new biometrics will need to go beyond policing and cover the broader use of the new technologies certainly by State actors but probably also the private sector.

Such legislation will need a cross-government approach, will not be easy and take time to develop.  What I do not see yet is a minister anywhere in government leading such thinking and starting a public conversation.","Biometrics Commissioner and Professor Paul Wiles",2020-05-06,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/biometrics-commissioners-address-to-the-westminster-forum-5-may-2020"

The United Kingdom thanks the High Commissioner for her update and welcomes the 30th report of the OHCHR Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and the report on Administration of Justice in Conflict-Related Cases.

The reports of detainees, held by the so-called ‘Donetsk people’s republic’ and ‘Luhansk people’s republic’ in eastern Ukraine, being subjected to ill-treatment and sexual violence, are deeply concerning. We call on Russia to use its significant influence over the de-facto authorities and end this appalling treatment.

Russia’s continued crackdown on freedom of religion or belief in Crimea is unacceptable. Their application of anti-extremist laws and sanctions on those who attempt to practice their faith must stop.

Approximately 101 Ukrainian political prisoners remain in unlawful detention in Crimea and Russia, subject to torture, ill-treatment and denial of medical care. The 16 September sentencing of seven Crimean Tatar activists is deplorable, and we are particularly worried that Volodomyr Dudka and Viktor Shur remain without urgent medical care.

We call on Russia to end its campaign of politically motivated persecutions and release all Ukrainian political prisoners immediately.

Madam High Commissioner,

What more can the international community do to ensure protection of detainees from ill-treatment and COVID-19 in line with relevant WHO recommendations?

Thank you.","Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and Rita French",2020-10-01,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/human-rights-council-45-statement-for-the-interactive-dialogue-with-the-high-commissioner-on-ukraine"

The United Kingdom would like to express its sincere thanks for the contribution of the Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons throughout her tenure.

The United Kingdom is grateful for her latest report, and agrees that governments must continue to work together with the private sector to ensure effective procedures to identify victims of trafficking in supply chains, and to provide those victims with access to support.

We are concerned that one consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak, in some parts of the world, will be reduced access to safe and reliable employment and a lack of social protection. This poses increased health risks to already vulnerable groups, such as women, children and migrant workers, and may force them to pursue unlawful or dangerous work that heightens their risk of exploitation.

Amidst the most immediate concerns of the international community to contain the pandemic, we must not lose sight of the continued action still needed to achieve SDG 8.7 and the eradication of child labour, forced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking.

How should the international community best work together to protect against the risks of trafficking for the most vulnerable, including women, children, and migrant workers, amidst the changing economic situation?

Coronavirus press conference 31 March 2020.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our daily briefing in the fight against COVID-19.

I am joined today by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, and Professor Stephen Powis, the Medical Director of NHS England.

I would like first to update you all on the facts about the spread of COVID-19 and the steps that we are then taking in the battle against this virus.

143,186  people have now been tested for the virus.

Of those, 25,150 have tested positive.

And sadly, yesterday we recorded the highest single increase in the number of deaths as a result of COVID-19.

381 people died, meaning that of those hospitalised in the UK,  the number who have passed away now totals 1,789.

Every death is the loss of a loved one, and our thoughts and prayers are with those who are grieving.

Overall, 10,767 people in England have been admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms.

The largest number of those is in London, with 3,915 people in hospital care.

While in the Midlands, the number of those hospitalised is now 1,918 and accelerating upwards.

These numbers reinforce the vital importance of following the Government’s social distancing guidelines.

The more we restrict contact, the more we slow the spread of the infection, the more that we can help the NHS build the capacity needed to care for those most in need.

And that capacity is increasing.

More NHS staff are returning to the frontline and more testing is taking place to help those self-isolating come back and to protect those working so hard in our hospitals and in social care.

But while the rate of testing is increasing we must go further, faster.

A critical constraint on the ability to rapidly increase testing capacity is the availability of the chemical reagents which are necessary in the testing.

The Prime Minister and the Health Secretary are working with companies worldwide to ensure that we get the material we need to increase tests of all kinds.

And as well as increasing the number of staff on the frontline, and the tests which protect them, we must also increase the capacity to provide oxygen to those worst affected by the disease.

We have just over 8,000 ventilators deployed in NHS hospitals now. This number has increased since the epidemic began, thanks to the hard work of NHS professionals.

But we need more.

That is why we are buying more ventilators from abroad – including from EU nations.

And it’s also why we are developing new sources of supply at home.

Before the epidemic struck we had very little domestic manufacture of ventilators.

But now, thanks to the dedication of existing medical supply companies and the ingenuity of our manufacturing base, we have existing models being produced in significantly greater numbers and new models coming on stream.

Orders have been placed with consortia led by Ford, Airbus, the Formula 1 Racing teams including Mclaren, GKN Aerospace and Rolls Royce and Dysons.

And I can announce that this weekend, the first of thousands of new ventilator devices will roll off the production line and be delivered to the NHS next week. From there they will be rapidly distributed to the front line.

And as well as increasing the capacity for ventilation – which helps support those patients worst affected – we are also increasing the capacity to provide oxygen to affected patients at an earlier stage in the process  of the disease, helping to avert, we hope, the deterioration of their condition.

A team led by UCL, working with Mercedes Benz, will produce 10,000 new CPAP devices to support affected patients and a team from Oxford University are also developing related technology.

And in our determination to prevent as many patients as possible seeing their condition worsen we are conducting rapid clinical trials on those drugs, including anti-malarials, which may be able to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on those affected.

But even as we seek to explore every avenue to slow the spread of the disease, to reduce its impact and to save lives, I am conscious of the sacrifices that so many are making.

That is why the Chancellor’s economic package is in place – to support people through a difficult time.

It is also why we we are working so closely with our colleagues in the devolved administrations to coordinate our response across the United Kingdom and I am grateful to them

As I am to the thousands of dedicated public sector workers – cleaners and social workers, prison and police officers, those in the Royal Mail and in our schools – and I want to thank them and also the leaders of the trade unions who represent them.

In this united national effort we also are delivering food and prescription drugs to up to 1.5 million of the most vulnerable who are self-isolating for three months.

And we will do more to help, working with the three quarters of a million people who have volunteered to help at this time. Many are already heavily involved in local community support schemes.

And we want to work with them to ensure that we support not just the 1.5 million most vulnerable to the disease but all those who need our help through this crisis, those without social support, those in tough economic circumstances, those who need the visible hand of friendship at a challenging time.

That is why my cabinet colleague George Eustice and the Food and Farming Minister Victoria Prentis will be leading work, with food suppliers, retailers, local authorities and voluntary groups to support our neighbours in need.

I also want to thank the men and women of the military who have stepped up their work as part of the ongoing response to coronavirus.

three RAF Puma helicopters are now  stationed at Kinloss Barracks in Moray. These Pumasare working closely with a Chinook and a Wildcat helicopter based at RAF Leeming, North Yorkshire, to meet any requests for assistance from NHS boards and trusts across Scotland and Northern England.

A second helicopter facility covers the Midlands and Southern England working out of The Aviation Task Force Headquarters at RAF Benson in Oxfordshire. Chinook and Wildcat helicopters normally based at RAF Odiham and RNAS Yeovilton respectively support the Southern areas.

And these helicopter facilities have been set up to support medical transports across Scotland and the rest of the UK. The task force is also available for general support such as moving equipment and personnel to where they are needed across the UK.

The Kinloss-based support follows last weekend’s use of an RAF A400M transport aircraft, working with the Scottish Ambulance Service, to evacuate a critically ill patient from the Shetland Islands to Aberdeen to receive intensive care treatment.

I am deeply grateful for everyone in the our armed forces and in the public sector who are doing so much to help in the fight against coronavirus

And, of course, all of us can continue to play our part in supporting them and the health service by

STAYING AT HOME

SUPPORTING THE NHS

AND SAVING LIVES.

Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.

I’m joined by Professor John Newton, our test and trace coordinator.

Before I provide an update on the work we are doing to combat coronavirus, I’d like to update you on the latest figures.

In total, 3,681,295 tests have been carried out in the UK, including 109,979 tests yesterday;

265,227 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,004 cases since yesterday.

Sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 37,048 people have now died. Yesterday, across the UK, 134 deaths were reported.

But for the first time since 18 March, I am very encouraged to confirm that yesterday there were no deaths from coronavirus recorded in Northern Ireland.

I want to pay tribute to Robin Swann, my opposite number, and all of those across the NHS and public health in Northern Ireland, and the people of Northern Ireland who have shown such resolve to be able to bend the curve down and thank them for all the work they have done.

While the news might not be this positive every day, I look forward to continuing to work with them to keep the virus under control in Northern Ireland.

Today’s figures from the ONS show across the UK as a whole, the lowest number of deaths from coronavirus for six weeks.

This is a national endeavour. And whatever the headwinds, as a country we can’t let up on this.

We are past the peak. We’re flattening the curve. We protected the NHS and the number of deaths is falling. We must keep our resolve.

I just want to say a massive thank you to everybody, over the Bank Holiday weekend, who stuck to the social distancing rules.

And to especially my colleagues in the NHS and in social care who are doing so much.

Even though we are through the peak, there are still 8,802 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK.

And there are still 98 NHS colleagues in hospital with coronavirus, including some of whom who are seriously ill.

So we must maintain our focus. And there are two areas I’d like to provide an update on today. PPE, and treatments. Both incredibly important for the future of tackling this disease – PPE and treatments.

PPE

First, we have been working hard to build our supplies of personal protective equipment.

I know how important this is, especially to colleagues on the frontline.

We all heard in the early weeks of this crisis, the calls from the frontline for more, and better PPE.

And we all saw the global scramble to acquire it.

I have been completely open about the scale and the difficulties of this challenge - building a new supply chain from scratch and of course the operational challenge of delivery.

General Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, said it himself - this is the single greatest logistical challenge he had faced in 40 years of service.

And in response, thanks to the Armed forces and so many others, including so many in the NHS, we have seen a mammoth effort.

We have ramped up domestic production. And I can announce that we have now signed contracts to manufacture 2 billion items of PPE here in the UK.

I set a national challenge here. And I’m absolutely delighted that Lord Deighton has stepped up and is helping us to deliver it.

Around the world, we have signed deals with over 100 new suppliers, including agreeing contracts for a further 3.7 billion gloves.

Whilst we continue to improve the logistics, and work hard to get everyone the PPE they need, these new supplies mean we are not simply keeping up with demand - but are able to begin to replenish our stockpiles.

There is a lot further to go on PPE, as on so many things, but we have made significant progress, and I’d like to thank everyone involved.

And PPE is of course so important as it’s about protecting the people who protect us. We will do that for as long as this virus remains on our shores.

Research and development

Next, I wanted to update you on some of the remarkable R&D into treatments that is taking place all across the UK.

One of Britain’s greatest strengths is our life sciences and research. And we are leading the world in the clinical trials being done here.

As I said at this podium last week, the very nature of scientific enquiry means that not every project will bear fruit.

But I am determined that we will explore every possible avenue.

The RECOVERY trial is the world’s largest trial of potential coronavirus treatments.

And because our NHS is a universal system, which we are all part of, we have some of the best data and can do some of the best research.

Today I can announce that we are beginning a new trial, for selected NHS patients, of an anti-viral drug, called remdesivir.

There have already been some promising early results on coronavirus patients, with early data suggesting it can shorten recovery time by about around four days.

As you can understand, we will be prioritising the use of this treatment where it will provide the greatest benefit. 
This is probably the biggest step forward in the treatment of coronavirus since the crisis began.

These are very early steps. But we are determined to support the science, and back projects that show promise.

I’d like to thank the NHS, the MHRA, the devolved administrations because this is UK-wide, and Gilead the pharmaceutical company, for their work in making this happen.

After all, it is worth remembering that in the battle against this virus, we are all on the same side.

So we will keep working across the world to develop the vaccines and the treatments - and indeed the vaccines - that will help us turn a corner.

But until a treatment or a vaccine comes good, there is no simple way to defeat this virus.

So we must not lose our resolve.

So please - stay alert, control the virus and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-05-26,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-26-may-2020"

Good afternoon. I am joined today by Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England and Sarah Albon who is the Chief Executive of the Health and Safety Executive.

First, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.

2,007,146 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 85,293 tests carried out yesterday.

226,463 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,403 cases since yesterday.

11,605 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, up from 11,465 the previous day

And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 32,692 have now died. That’s an increase of 627 fatalities since yesterday.

This is of course devastating news for families across the UK, and we all need to stay alert and control the virus.

I just want to remind people of the details of the next phase of our fight against coronavirus that we set out this week.

If we turn to the first slide, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System, with five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus. 

The alert level will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.

And in turn that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place. 

The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures.

The social distancing measures remain critical in our efforts to control the virus.

Throughout the period of lockdown, which started on March 23 we have been at Level 4.

Meaning, a COVID-19 epidemic is in general circulation, and transmission is high or rising exponentially.

But thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, you have helped to bring the R level down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in careful steps.

As you see on the next slide, we have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life - but crucially, while avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS.

 After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.

Step 1. From this week:

Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work.

You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like.

You can meet one person outside of your household outside provided you stay 2 metres apart.

Step 2. From June 1, at the earliest, as long as the data allows, we aim to allow:

Primary schools to reopen for some pupils, in smaller class sizes.

Non-essential retail to start to reopen, when and where it is safe to do so,

Cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed doors, without crowds.

And then Step 3. No earlier than July 4, and again, only if the data says it is safe, we aim to allow:

More businesses and premises to open, including potentially those offering personal care such as leisure facilities, public places, and places of worship.

Many of these businesses will need to operate in new ways to ensure they are safe, and we will work with these sectors on how to do this.

As you will see from slide 3, having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures, and our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated our messaging.

We are now asking people to Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives.

Yes - staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible.

But there are a range of other actions we’re advising people to take.

People should stay alert, by:

Working from home if you can.

Limiting contact with other people.

Keeping distance if you go out - 2 metres apart where possible.

Washing your hands regularly.

Wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed space where it’s difficult to be socially distant - for example in some shops and on public transport.

And if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate.

As slide 4 shows, if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections.

This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.

And to underpin this in the workplace, we have published new ‘COVID-19 secure’ guidance on working safely, available to UK employers, across 8 work settings, which are allowed to be open and where their employees cannot work from home.

This also includes guidance for shops which we believe may be in a position to begin a phased reopening at the earliest from the 1 June.

Firms, unions, industry bodies and the devolved administrations have all fed into this guidance to give businesses and their employees the confidence they need to work safely.

And I believe we have reached a consensus in doing that.

We have also worked with Public Health England and the Health and Safety Executive, to develop best practice on the safest ways of working across the economy.

The guidelines outline practical steps for employers to take, including carrying out a COVID-19 risk assessment, in consultation with employees or trades unions.

A downloadable notice is included in the documents, which employers should display in their workplace to show their employees, customers and other visitors, that they have followed this guidance.

We have also provided practical steps for employers to consider such as putting up barriers or screens in shared spaces, creating “fixed teams” or “partnering” to minimise the number of people in contact with one another, and frequent cleaning of work areas and equipment between uses to reduce transmission.

To support employers and employees through this, the government has made available up to an extra £14 million for the Health and Safety Executive, equivalent to an increase of 10% of their budget.

This is for extra call centre employees, inspectors and equipment, if needed.

We know how important the Job Retention Scheme has been in helping businesses through this difficult time.

And today the Chancellor has announced a four-month extension of the scheme to help provide certainty to businesses.

To date, 7.5 million jobs have been furloughed, protecting livelihoods across the nation.

Until the end of July, there will be no changes to the scheme.

Then from August to October the scheme will continue, for all sectors and regions of the UK, but with greater flexibility to support the transition back to work.

Employers currently using the scheme will be able to bring employees back part time.

And, as the economy reopens, we will ask firms to start sharing, with government, the cost of paying people’s salaries.

To be clear, the same level of support of 80% of people’s current salary, up to £2,500 will continue to be met, but through a shared effort between employers and government.

We will be setting out more details on the changes before the end of the month.

Throughout this pandemic, I have been struck by the way people have looked out for one another.

These measures are produced in that spirit.

So to employers I say: use this support and guidance to know you are doing the right thing and work with your unions and workers to keep each other safe.

And to workers I say: we are looking out for you; we want you to feel confident that you are financially supported and returning to a safe workplace.

Because in this time like no other, we all need to work together safely, as we rebuild our economy.

Thank you.","Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP",2020-05-12,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-12-may-2020"

I am honoured to deliver this statement on behalf of the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada.

We convene as the world continues to tackle COVID-19. This pandemic has had a significant impact on women and girls, exacerbating gender inequalities and the intersectional nature of disadvantage they experience.

Measures to contain the virus are putting women and girls at greater risk of gender-based violence and harmful practices, including female genital mutilation, unintended pregnancy and early and forced marriage.  COVID-19 has further underscored the urgency of ending violence against women and girls.

COVID-19 threatens decades of progress towards securing universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, including adequate maternal care and access to sexual and reproductive health services. This results in millions of unintended pregnancies and inhibits women and girls’ bodily autonomy. States must ensure that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights remain a priority.

The disruption to quality education and prolonged school closures will have a lasting effect on future opportunities for youth, particularly girls. Malala Fund estimates 20 million more secondary school age girls could be out of school after the crisis has passed.

We have an obligation to address intersecting forms of discrimination and violence that impede the full realisation of women and girls’ rights. With only 10 years remaining to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, urgent action is needed.  We must ensure the full and meaningful participation of women and girls at all levels of decision-making and integrate gender perspectives in COVID-19 responses that consider all dimensions of intersectionality.

We support all efforts by the Council to integrate a gender and intersectional perspective into its work and its mechanisms.  Only by taking a holistic approach will the Council be able to tackle gender-based discrimination in all its forms. We ask all governments to join us in putting women and girls’ rights at the forefront of their responses to COVID-19.

Opening remarks

Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.

I’m pleased to be joined today by Dr Jenny Harries.

Latest data

Before I talk about the latest steps we are taking to defeat coronavirus, let me update you on the latest information from the COBR data file.

I can report that through the government’s monitoring and testing programme, as of today (24 April 2020)

612,031 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 28,532 tests yesterday
  143,464 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 5,386 cases since yesterday
  17,049 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down from 17,615 on 22 April and down 10% on last week
  and sadly, of those in hospital with the virus, 19,506 have now died - that’s an increase of 684 fatalities since yesterday
We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of these victims.

We must not forget that each of these statistics represents a personal tragedy.

Transport importance

Despite the continued challenges ahead, as we prepare for the next stage in our battle to beat this pandemic, there are tentative signs we are making progress.

The main reason for that is the way Britain has responded to the guidance to stay at home and maintain social distancing over the past few weeks.

By respecting these measures, the whole country is slowing the spread of the virus.
And by avoiding public transport, you’re freeing up space for critical workers who rely on buses and trains to travel safely.

The continued operation of both passenger and freight transport is critically important to our resilience as a country.

So today I’m announcing a new package of measures to ensure transport boosts our national response to COVID-19.

Freight

First, we’re announcing a far-reaching package to safeguard the flow of essential goods into – and across – the country.

I can announce the government has secured a trilateral agreement along with the French and Irish governments which commits our nations to keeping freight routes open throughout the crisis…

Bringing in life-saving medicines, food and many other essential goods…..

Allowing us to meet the needs of our countries during this difficult time.

Operators on many of these routes have been under rising financial pressures due to falling demand.

Since many of them bring in crucial goods like medicines, raw materials and chemicals to purify water, it is important to guarantee the continuation of services.

So, we’re protecting ferry routes between Great Britain and Northern Ireland with funding of up to £17 million.

We’re also taking action to secure services around the United Kingdom, including up to £10.5 million for links to the Isle of Wight and the Scilly Isles, allowing critical freight to continue to support families in every part of our country.

And we’re making sure that air links to Belfast and Derry-Londonderry in Northern Ireland will also continue – these routes are particularly important for critical workers.

Thanks to the measures I’ve announced today, we are safeguarding 5 ferry and 2 air routes between Great Britain and Northern Ireland; and 26 different freight routes between Britain, France, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden.

Transport Support Unit

Second, we have launched a Transport Support Unit (TSU) dedicated to fighting this pandemic.

At the beginning of this crisis we reduced services like rail and buses, whilst securing their continuation to enable critical workers and others to make essential journeys.

Lower ridership means we have spare transport capacity which I have directed to be used for logistical tasks in the fight against this virus.

By making use of the people and the resources of the Department for Transport, its agencies and arm’s length bodies, we will be helping NHS trusts and local resilience groups to fight the pandemic.

We now have over 8,500 specialist volunteers from across the transport sector.

And around 9,000 vehicles which can support the national effort.

This includes 4 fixed-wing aircraft owned by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (one of them a Boeing 737), helicopters, ships and trains.

Together they will help move emergency patients and medical supplies, deliver personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals, and distribute food parcels to vulnerable people.

And vehicles from Highways England will act as mobile COVID-19 testing centres.

Network Rail is also making available its 7 regional distribution centres which can be used to support the effort.

This work is underway and I would like to thank all those taking part, like the Network Rail engineers who helped fit out the Nightingale hospital in Manchester.

As the country works hard to beat this virus, it’s vital we come together and help each other.

So, the Transport Support Unit is getting to work, helping frontline staff, and making full use of the significant resources at its disposal.

Drones

I have also given the green light to trials of drones delivering medical supplies.

Earlier this year, we awarded £28 million to Southampton and Portsmouth to develop a Future Transport Zone.

As part of that initiative, £8 million was earmarked for testing drones, and how they might be used for delivering goods in the years and decades ahead.

Of course, now we have an urgent need, so we’re making use of that testing programme as part of our response to COVID-19.

As a result, I have fast-tracked trials to begin next week to carry medical supplies and equipment to St Mary’s Hospital, near Newport on the Isle of Wight.

Trams

Finally, we have made funding available today to keep England’s trams operating.

This will keep open 5 light rail networks in Greater Manchester, Sheffield, Nottingham, West Midlands and Tyne and Wear….

Allowing essential local routes to remain open.

Once again ensuring that critical workers can travel during this crisis.

Transport workers

All these new initiatives build on the very considerable work we’ve seen across transport since this crisis began.

The government has taken widespread action to support the industry.

For example, we’ve stepped in to keep trains operating…

And to keep buses running.

We’ve worked with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and airlines to bring thousands of Britons home from abroad.

As of today, I can also confirm there are no British holidaymakers left stranded on cruise ships anywhere in the world.

To help motorists we’ve waived MOT renewals until the end of the outbreak, ensuring that vulnerable people are able to stay at home without the worry.

But I want to pay particular tribute to the transport critical workers who have gone above and beyond to keep vital freight and passenger services running…

To keep hospitals and chemists supplied with medical goods…

To ensure supermarkets are stocked with fresh food…

And to maintain deliveries of essential energy and fuel supplies.

From hauliers and train drivers to those keeping our ports and airports open.

Each and every one of us depends on the transport lifeline they provide.

They are part of the army of critical workers helping to fight this terrible scourge.

Five tests

But before we consider it safe to amend the guidance, we must be satisfied we have met the 5 tests set by the First Secretary.

To ensure….

That the NHS can continue to cope
  That the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently
  That the rate of infection is falling
  That the operational challenges have been met
  And, most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peak
Concluding remarks

We don’t yet know when that day will come, but I do know it will arrive sooner if motorists and others continue to only make essential journeys.

The actions I’ve announced today will ensure that transport can continue to serve the nation during this crisis…..

Keep us supplied with everything we need to stay at home.

Yet also ensure that the infrastructure required to emerge from this pandemic stands-ready to serve us all when the time comes.","Department for Transport and The Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP",2020-04-24,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/secretary-of-state-for-transport-delivers-daily-coronavirus-update-24-april-2020"
"153","Speech","UN Human Rights Council 45: Interactive Dialogue with the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria","UK's International Ambassador for Human Rights, Rita French's statement during the Interactive Dialogue with the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria.","Thank you, Mr Pinheiro, Commissioners,

The UK reiterates its strong support for the Commission’s work and shares its concern about the dire human rights situation in Syria.

The report highlights the continued patterns of killings, arbitrary detention, and sexual and gender based violence committed by the regime. Such repression was exactly the catalyst for protests prior to the conflict. Despite nearly ten years of war, the regime has not mended its ways, and continues to violate international humanitarian law, and international human rights law.

The Commission’s findings that the Syrian National Army and affiliated armed groups abused human rights in northern Syria are concerning.  There is a disturbing pattern of looting, property confiscation, detention, torture and gender based violence against the local population.  Furthermore, as the Commission states, destruction of UNESCO heritage sites and other cultural property violates international humanitarian law.

Reducing the number of humanitarian aid cross border entry points has exacerbated the needs of the Syrian population.  This, coupled with the rise in Covid cases, is of grave concern. We agree with the Commission that all parties must allow humanitarian access, abide by international law and respect current ceasefires.

Commissioners,

The situation of human rights across the whole of Syria remains appalling. As we approach the tenth anniversary of this conflict, it is imperative to support an inclusive political settlement and end the suffering of the Syrian people.

Thank you.","Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and Rita French",2020-09-22,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/un-human-rights-council-45-interactive-dialogue-with-the-un-commission-of-inquiry-on-syria"
"154","Speech","Education Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 May","Education Secretary on the Government’s response to the outbreak of coronavirus and plans to begin returning to school safely","Coronavirus press conference 16 May 2020

Welcome to today’s briefing from Downing Street. I am joined by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer.

First, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.

2,489,563 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 136,486 tests carried out yesterday;

240,161 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,451 cases since yesterday;

10,484 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down 12% from 11,872 this time last week.

And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 34,466 have now died. That’s an increase of 468 fatalities since yesterday. This figure is in all settings not just hospitals.

Before we begin questions from the public and from the media I want to remind people of the details of the next phase of our fight against coronavirus.

First, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System, with five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus.

The alert level will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.

And in turn that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place.

The lower the level, the fewer the measures; the higher the level, the stricter the measures.

Throughout the period of lockdown which started on 23 March we have been at Level 4.

Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the level of infection down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in very careful steps.

We have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life - but crucially avoiding what would be a second peak that overwhelms the NHS.

After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.

Step 1, from this week, means those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work. You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like. You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided you stay two metres apart.

Having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated what we are asking people to do, which is to Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives.

If everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by ensuring the R number does not go above one and reducing the number of infections. This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.

At this time of year GCSE and A level students would have been making final preparations for their exams, while others were enjoying their summer term.

If you are one of them, can I say how sorry I am that this has happened to you this year.

The sacrifices that you and all young people have made have been especially tough.

It is now almost eight weeks since we asked schools, nurseries and colleges to close to all but a small number of children.

Once again I would like to say an enormous thank you to all the school, college and childcare staff who have been going above and beyond the call of duty to care for smaller groups of children of critical workers, vulnerable children as well as making sure there are resources available at home for children to learn, interacting with them and making sure that children know you are there for them. You have been simply outstanding and we’re so grateful for what you have done.

We have been quite clear all along, that we would only start inviting more children back into schools when our five key tests had been met. That position has not changed and it is what is guiding our actions.

But we do want to see all children back in school because we know how much children grow and benefit from being in school.

We can now start the planning for a very limited return to schools for some pupils potentially as early as next month.

Let me explain how this will work because I know that some people, including parents and teachers, are very anxious about this.

If the rates of infection are decreasing, it will give us a green light to get children back into childcare and more of them back into school from 1 June.

As part of a cautious phased return, those in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 will be allowed back into school in smaller class sizes. We are also planning to get some secondary school students back – those in years 10 and 12 – to make sure they have the opportunity to come back to school on a limited basis and have some face to face time with teachers.

We are prioritising these children because they stand to lose more by staying away from school. The first years of school are pivotal for children to develop social and behavioural skills and to learn the basics that are going to have a huge bearing on how well they do in their life. Students in Years 10 and 12 need support in the run up to vital exams next year and it’s vital that we do all we can to help them succeed and help them do well.

This is particularly important for vulnerable and disadvantaged young people.

There are some who would like to delay the wider opening of schools. But there is a consequence to this. The longer that schools are closed, the more children miss out. Teachers know this. Teachers know that there are children out there who have not spoken to or played with another child of their own age for the last two months.

They know there are children from difficult or very unhappy homes for whom school is their happiest place in their week. It’s also the safest place for them to be and it’s thanks to their teachers and the support that their teachers give to them that they are safe and happy.

The poorest children, the most disadvantaged children, the children who do not always have support they need at home, will be the ones who will fall furthest behind if we keep school gates closed. They are the ones who will miss out on the opportunities and chances in life that we want all children to benefit from what teachers and schools deliver for them.

So we’re asking some children to come back from the 1 June. And we are asking schools to adopt a number of strict protective measures.

This includes reducing class sizes, and making sure pupils stay within these small groups, creating a protective and small bubble around them.

Schools will also be rigorous about hygiene, cleaning and hand washing. School staff can already be tested for the virus but from 1 June we will extend that to cover children and their families if any of them develop symptoms. Track-and-trace methods will then be used to prevent the virus from spreading.

Together, these measures will create an inherently safer system, where the risk of transmission is substantially reduced – for children, their teachers and also their families.

My department has been issuing full and detailed guidance on how to implement these measures and prepare for wider opening. We have worked closely with the sector, listening to those who work in the classroom. We will continue to do so, to ensure schools have the support they need.

It goes without saying that we will be carefully monitoring the impact this first phase has and we will use this to guide us when we consider our next steps.

This phased return is in line with what other European countries are doing to get their own schools, colleges and nurseries back.

I know a lot of you may be worried about sending your children to school. Every one of us wants the very best for our children and I know how stressful this time has been for many families. I want to reassure you that this approach is based on the best scientific advice, with children at the very heart of everything we do.

Education is one of the most important gifts we can give any children.

So when we are advised that we can start to bring some children back to school we should do so, so that they don’t miss out on the enormous opportunities to learn, to be with their friends and to benefit from everything that their teachers and schools can offer them. We owe it to the children in order to be able to do that.

I would like now to hand over to Jenny and then we will take some questions.","Department for Education and The Rt Hon Gavin Williamson CBE MP",2020-05-16,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/education-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-may"
"155","Speech","Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 2 June 2020","Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock gave the 2 June 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.","Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing. In keeping with the new format, I’ll go through the slides now and then we’ll take questions from members of the public and from journalists.

Slide one shows the testing capacity and the number of new cases. The top chart in the slide shows the number of tests. That number of tests as of 2 June was 135,643. This is different to testing capacity which stands at just over 200,000.

As I said yesterday, this demonstrates that there is spare capacity in testing. So if you have symptoms of coronavirus, that’s a fever or a new dry cough or a change in your sense of taste or smell, then please do go and get a test from nhs.uk/coronavirus or by phoning 119. It’s incredibly important that we can trace the virus by ensuring that anybody with symptoms has a test. And of course we’re rolling out testing across care homes and making sure staff in hospitals get the opportunity to be tested as well.

The bottom chart on the slide shows the number of confirmed cases. This is 1,613 as of 2 June. This brings the total number of cases confirmed in the UK to 277,985. Although the 1,613 figure is slightly higher than yesterday we can see that the 7-day rolling average continues to fall.

The data from hospitals show that those new admissions to hospitals in England has fallen to 436. This is down from 471 on 24 May, so just over a week ago, and down from a high of 3,121 on 2 April. This figure of 436 admissions to hospitals in England with COVID-19 is the lowest figure since 20 March. It demonstrates once again that we are making progress against this disease. Again, as yesterday the proportion of mechanical ventilators, ventilated beds that are occupied by patients with coronavirus remains at 9%.

Just like yesterday, the number of people in hospital continues to fall. 7,607 are now in hospital with coronavirus and that is falling, broadly falling in each part of the country, but for a little bit of day-to-day movement in some of the areas, for instance as you can see right at the end of the chart for the North East and Yorkshire. But we keep that very closely under review. But the overriding trend, as you can see, is downwards.

The next slide is the number of deaths and sadly on the 2 June [correction: 1 June], yesterday, 324 deaths with coronavirus were recorded taking the total to 39,369. We mourn each one of these. We try to keep these data as accurate as possible, including where we find, in the past, in some cases there are deaths where we discover there has been a connection to coronavirus and we add those into those data. So again we can see that the trend is broadly down but there is still some way to go. And after the weekend effect, which we’ve seen each weekend in terms of the number of deaths recorded, because this is according to the date these are recorded, we’ve seen that rise on most Mondays and sadly the figure is 324 today.

The final slide reports on data from the Office for National Statistics which was reported this morning and reported a total of 48,106 deaths in the UK where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. You can see again that this number is falling. The top chart shows those data and where we were on the recorded daily deaths data for the period that corresponded to these data coming from the ONS. On the bottom chart we can see the place of occurrence of those deaths. You can see both the number of deaths and the proportion of deaths that are in care homes, both of those are falling. 27.3% of deaths occurred in care homes in the latest ONS data to the week of 22 May, bringing the proportion overall of deaths in care homes down to 32.5%.

We don’t capture in these charts, but we do capture in a report published by Public Health England today further data, some of which are much more troubling. The PHE investigation into the way in which the virus targets people unequally and disproportionately has been put on the website. This is a particularly timely publication because right across the world people are angry about racial injustice and I get that. Black lives matter and I want to say this to everyone who works in the NHS and in social care. I value the contribution that you make, everybody equally. And I want to say it right across society too. I want to thank you and I want you to know that our whole country cares about your wellbeing. And I value too those who come to our country to work in the NHS and in social care. And I love that this country is one of the most welcoming and tolerant and diverse. That goes for the whole country and it goes especially for the health and care system.

As I said in the House of Commons earlier, PHE’s investigation found that age is the biggest risk factor for coronavirus, next gender, living in a city is a risk and being black or from a minority ethnic background is also a significant risk factor. There is much more work to do to understand what is driving these disparities and how the different risk factors interact and we are absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this and find ways of closing that gap. I’m delighted that Kemi Badenoch, the Minister for Equalities, will be taking this work forward, working with PHE and many others.

We value the contribution from everyone to fighting this virus. Everyone has a contribution to make. Of course, the thing that every single person can do is to make their personal contribution to fighting this virus. In the first instance things as simple as washing your hands, following the social distancing rules and of course if you have symptoms please self-isolate immediately and get tested to protect your friends and family. So let’s keep going and we’ll get through this. We’ll now turn to questions.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-06-03,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-2-june-2020"
"156","Speech","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 May 2020","Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Oliver Dowden gave the 30 May 2020 daily press briefing on the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Watch Oliver Dowden’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 May 2020

Let me begin with the latest figures:

4,171,408 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 127,722 tests carried out yesterday;
  272,826 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,445 cases since yesterday;
  And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 38,376 have now died. That’s an increase of 215 fatalities since yesterday. This new figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.
Of course, every one of those deaths is a tragedy, for the family involved and our thoughts are with all of them.

As the Chancellor outlined yesterday, those numbers show we are now past the peak and as we continue to flatten the curve, we are able to start reopening parts of the economy. We are also looking at how to begin relaxing other measures so that we can reestablish some normality in other parts of our lives.

Which brings me to something which many people have been eagerly awaiting news about – that’s the return of live sport.

More than two months after sport stopped, and after weeks of round-the-clock discussions with medical experts and professional sports bodies, I’m delighted to announce today that the government has published guidance which allows competitive sport to resume behind closed doors from Monday at the earliest, and crucially, only when it is safe to do so.

It’s up to each individual sport to decide exactly when to resume competition. They know their sports best.

But football, tennis, horse racing, Formula One, cricket, golf, rugby, snooker and others – all are set to return to our screens shortly, with horse racing first out of the gate in the North East next week.

It’s been a huge challenge to get to this point. We’ve taken a forensic, clinician-led approach, working with Public Health England and the Department of Health every step along the way.

We’ve had dozens of meetings, and published pages of detailed guidance outlining first how to get elite athletes back into socially-distanced training, and then back into close-contact training.

Throughout all of this, we’ve put the safety of the athletes, coaches and support staff first and foremost. And by working so closely with the sports themselves, we have made sure this has been a collaborative, consensual effort to create the safest possible environments for everyone involved.

The guidance outlines various measures that need to be in place for an event to go ahead, and to keep everyone involved safe. That includes a screening process for coronavirus symptoms at the venue, a one-way system for people and vehicles, minimising the use of dressing rooms, and of course, maintaining social distancing wherever that is possible.

And as all sports fully recognise, ensuring the mental health of their athletes and staff is as important as their physical health, particularly in these very difficult times. Our guidance today reinforces that.

It’s taken a lot of hard work to get us here today, so thank you to everyone those involved. It will be welcome news for many.

Much of the media attention has focused on football, because it has a special place in our national life. Recognising its significance, I set two challenges for football’s return: first that a reasonable number of remaining Premier League games would be broadcast free-to-air, and second that the financial benefits of returning would be shared throughout the entire football family.

I’m glad to confirm today that a third of the matches to finish the season will now be free to view, including the Liverpool v Everton derby. Live Premier League football will be on the BBC for the first time in its history. This is an open invitation to all fans to be part of this significant moment in our sporting history. It also of course has the really serious public health benefit of encouraging people to watch at home, which will be essential.

Getting the top leagues back up and running will also release much needed funding to support clubs lower down, many of whom are cornerstones of their local communities.

With both of these benefits, I can now make it official: Football is coming back.

Of course, these headline sporting events are only one part of the story.

I’m keenly aware that even as we reopen some domestic competitive fixtures, not all events will be back on.

And given the deserved momentum that had built up behind women’s sport after the football, cricket and netball world cups, I will be working hard with the Sports Minister to make sure we don’t lose any of that progress. Visibility matters. Our daughters deserve to see female athletes on the main stage.

Now our focus is also on how we can get grassroots sport back up and running safely, so that people can reunite with their local teammates.

While those teams can’t compete together yet, today I’m glad to confirm that we are also relaxing the rules on exercise further, so that from Monday people will be able to exercise with up to five others from different households, crucially so long as they remain 2 metres apart.

That means people who play team sports can train together and do things like conditioning and fitness sessions that don’t involve physical contact.

It’s another vital and important step in the right direction.

We’ve all become a nation of early morning walkers, Wicks workout-ers and evening park runners. Many of us have discovered how valuable and therapeutic physical activity can be and, I hope, we will continue to make more time for it even as life gradually returns to normal.

We still have a way to go. But for a sport-loving nation, today really is a significant milestone. We won’t be sitting in the stands for a while, and things will be very different to what we’re used to. But live sport will be back on our screens next week. The British sports recovery has begun.","Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, Office for Civil Society, and The Rt Hon Oliver Dowden CBE MP",2020-05-30,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/oliver-dowdens-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-30-may-2020--2"
"157","Speech","Platform for Redesign 2020: closing address","Closing address by Kwasi Kwarteng, Minister of State, Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, at the Online Platform on Sustainable and Resilient Recovery from COVID-19, hosted by the Japanese Government.","I want to start by thanking Minister Koizumi for organising this really remarkable discussion, and I’d also like to thank all the other participants as well.

This event has demonstrated the passion that we all share for meeting our Paris goals, and the benefits of coming together, sharing our experiences, and working towards a common purpose.

This all gives me and the UK great confidence for COP26 next year.

We can all see that, as we recover from the coronavirus pandemic, we have a huge opportunity to build back better – to build our recovery on a fairer, greener, cleaner, and more resilient economy.

And that is the agenda that we will be putting at the heart of our COP26 Presidency next year.

The COP President Designate outlined our progress to date on clean growth in his remarks, so I would like to focus on what comes next.

In the UK, there are almost half a million jobs in low carbon businesses and their supply chains, and there is a real potential to use our recovery to create more jobs in this area.

So in the Summer Economic Statement, our Chancellor announced £3 billion to support measures to reduce greenhouse emissions from buildings, supporting as many as 140,000 green jobs.

We’re committed to spending more than £2 billion to the industrial sector over eight years to help them reduce their emissions and energy bills.

And we are committing hundreds of millions of pounds to developing new technologies to help to decarbonise older processes:

We’re interested in developing Direct Air Capture, which takes CO2 emissions immediately out of the air around us.

We’re committed also to Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage, which we aim to start deploying by the middle of this decade, and we want to be able to share our findings and collaborate with other partners and friends across the world.

Projects like these allow us to rapidly move towards a decarbonised economy, as is vital to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, and I think also all of this work can pave the way for ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in the fight against climate change.

That is our priority for our COVID recovery, and the vision behind our economic policies and the COP Presidency which we very much look forward to next year.

So I am delighted to have heard similar examples from so many countries today.

It is vitally important that all our nation’s build on the ideas we are sharing today, and we challenge ourselves to submit more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions and Long Term Strategies that set the path to net zero, ahead of COP26.

The UK has committed in law to being net zero by 2050, and I hope other nations can join us on this journey and make a similar commitment.

Thank you once again Minister Koizumi for this excellent forum, for bringing all of this together, and I look forward to supporting all of your efforts as participants ahead of COP26 next year. I hope we can all work together as we are doing for an ambitious and clean recovery. Thank you very much.","Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and The Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng MP",2020-09-03,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/platform-for-redesign-2020-closing-address"
"158","Speech","Local Government Association annual conference 2020: Secretary of State's speech","Speech by Secretary of State Robert Jenrick MP at the Local Government Association’s annual conference 2020.","Good afternoon everyone. It goes without saying that we’ve been living through some extraordinary times. The fact that as a country we’ve risen to meet them is down in no small part to many of the extraordinary people joining us on the line today.

I think back to the comments that The Queen made on VE day when she said that “We are still a nation [that] those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire”.

I’ve no doubt that when she said that, The Queen was speaking in part about your staff in councils and about your communities. You and your staff really are the unsung heroes who have worked tirelessly to get us through the crisis.

From protecting vulnerable people, to keeping essential public services going, like bin collections, mobilising hundreds of thousands of volunteers, keeping schools open for the children of key workers and the vulnerable, keeping our parks open, you have made such a huge contribution to our national effort.

And I want to say on behalf of the Prime Minister and the whole government a big thank you to you which I hope you in turn can pass onto everyone who works in each of your councils.

And now that we look to the future, the the heroes of the pandemic are becoming the heroes of our national recovery…

…with businesses starting up again, with high streets in your communities and mine beginning to spring back to life, housebuilding and construction projects starting again, places of worship reopening and life events like weddings beginning once again in the month of July.

More broadly, people, in the length and breadth of the country, beginning enjoy the freedoms that we took for granted before COVID-19 and which for perfectly understandable reasons had to be curtailed.

I don’t think in my lifetime I can think of another occasion on which local councils have never played a more important and more central role in the life of the country and our national mission than over the course of the last few months.

So I want to  begin by saying how incredibly grateful all of us in government are for everything that you’ve been doing – for working with us so closely to achieve some remarkable feats for which you should be rightly proud. Things that in normal times might have taken years to achieve, have been done in a matter of weeks.

Some of those have truly been silver linings in the dark cloud of COVID-19. I think in particular about your work in helping almost almost 15,000 vulnerable people, many of whom were sleeping rough at the start of the pandemic, into safer accommodation, which has undoubtedly protected hundreds, if not thousands, of people’s lives.

And now, your work on that mission to ensure those people don’t go back onto the street. That as many of them as possible can be moved into better, move on accommodation, using some of the funding that we agreed forwards, to buy 6,000 new units in all part of the country. Creating a new national asset of move-on accommodation akin to the one created by my predecessor many years ago, George Young in the 1990s.

Instances like that show what local government adds to this country and how important it is that we have a strong and productive relationship between central and local government. When we do, we can really achieve great things.

It’s meant that – through your hard work we’ve been able to get the extra funding we’ve provided for other important missions. Like, for example, on domestic violence – something that I care very much about and have wanted to ensure that we have the protections in place through the legal changes we’re making in the longer term in Parliament at the moment, which will require practical implementation on the ground.

It’s meant a huge effort to support hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses – 800,000 in total.

I’ve been inspired by everything you have done in partnership with the voluntary sector in your communities. For example, supporting the clinically extremely vulnerable who have been shielding…

…from the tailored food boxes that you helped to deliver, complementing the national food boxes that we’ve been delivering, to the mental health support, the check in and chat services, that have been done in all parts of the country. As a result of that effort and the more than 3 million food boxes that have been delivered, we’ve helped to shield and to protect millions of people through the pandemic and undoubtedly, as a result of that, to save people’s lives.

I’ve been very touched by the emails and messages that I’ve received, and my Department has, which has been people across the country showing their thanks for that work. Sometimes thanking central government for the food boxes that we’ve delivered, but very often giving thanks for the personal support that you’ve provided to those individuals.

One of the most poignant moments for me was receiving an email from a 5-year-old boy from Corby, called Kaydyn, who lives with cystic fibrosis, and he and his mother were shielding and relying upon the food boxes that had been delivered and the support from their local council.

I remember that a week later, Kaydyn received a call from Prince William – the Duke of Cambridge – and they spoke about the shielding programme. I will never forget how happy he was to receive that call and grateful for the support that his local council, working in harmony and productive partnership with central government, had managed to achieve to help him and his mum.

And, from speaking to colleagues across the country here in Parliament, I know there are countless other examples where people have come together and gone the extra mile and achieved great things for their communities…

…through small acts of kindness and courage. Small acts that together have made a huge difference.

But I wanted to say that the current situation in Leicester clearly reminds us there’s no room for complacency – it’s an echo of the difficult days we faced at the height of the pandemic and a reminder that there’s still a great deal of work to be done to weather the storms of the pandemic.

That we in central government you in local government still have a big task to work together to get the country through this. I’m going to say a bit more in a moment about Leicester and about how we’re going to work, I hope productively, on local lockdowns in the future.

Finance (COVID-19)

I’m under absolutely no illusion about the profound impact this emergency has had on local government – both personally, with the huge effort that councillors and officers have put in, but also financially.

I said – as did the Chancellor Rishi Sunak – at the start of the crisis that we would ensure councils have the resources that you need to weather this storm – and I meant it and I know that the Chancellor meant it as well

I said I would champion your cause in government, that I would fight your corner – and I meant it.

Since the start of the crisis, we have provided more than £27 billion to get councils, local businesses and communities through COVID-19…

…including £3.8 billion of new funding to councils…

… over £20 billion in support for local businesses, including pausing business rates and offering the additional grant funding that councils have been so superb in getting out to the front line…

…over £5 billion in cashflow support for councils …

…£105 million to support rough sleepers…

…and £500 million in council tax hardship funds to offer absolutely vital economic support to the most vulnerable.

But I think it’s important not to get lost in these large numbers – there are individual stories behind each of these figures.

I think of my own constituency and the hard work my local council has put in in Newark and Sherwood, like  Beaumond House Hospice in Newark. They have been able to access small business grants to keep their charity shops going, and have been supported by fund specifically made available from the government.

I think of victims of domestic abuse in my local constituency like our local refuge, which has been able to weather the storm and to put in place extra capacity so that as lockdown eases and more victims of domestic abuse require housing and support the funding and capacity should be there. And if it isn’t, there’s more work for us to do in the future to make sure to make the funding available.

COVID-19 expenditure

From discussions that I’ve had over the past few weeks, I appreciate the very clear concern from councils the future. Many councils are worried about the financial burdens of COVID-19 and I want to provide the certainty and the stability that you need to plan for the rest of the financial year.

That’s why today I am announcing the next stage of our plan, and this, I hope, will provide you with that certainty and provides for the first time a comprehensive plan which provides the 3 central pillars of support – COVID-19 related expenditure, irrecoverable income loss, and losses in tax revenue.

This is a more sophisticated plan, developed in conversation with the LGA, and has been designed to give council leaders and officers the confidence to continue to deliver essential public services for the rest of the financial year.

You’ve stepped up and supported people in their time of need – and I want central government to step up and to support you too.

Moving forwards, it is difficult to forecast accurately the true financial consequences of COVID-19 on all councils. Many have incurred significant costs – but whether these costs continue or begin to gradually decline depends on the virus itself.

Councils have seen a reduction in tax revenue, but, as with everything, the scale of this reduction will be in line with the scale of wider economic disruption and we’ll learn more about that in the months to come

Similarly, with the third pillar, councils have lost a great deal of income from sales, fees and charges since the start of the pandemic.

Across the country, car parks, museums and leisure centres have been closed for the past few months, and I know this has had a very significant impact on many councils’ finances.

Many of these, I am delighted to say, are either open again or will be shortly as we move into the phase beginning on 4 July – and these revenue streams should start to slowly recover, depending on the speed and the scale of our national economic recovery.

So what is important, with these points in mind, is the need for a comprehensive plan which is flexible enough to adapt to the needs of local councils, and to the different possible scenarios ahead.

That’s exactly what we are announcing today.

If I can speak briefly to each of the three pillars.

Firstly, for COVID-19 related expenditure.

This morning I announced that councils in England will receive a further £500 million to support their communities, taking the total support provided by government to £4.3 billion over the course of the last few months.

Recognising that councils are best placed to decide how to meet pressures in their local area, this funding has not been ringfenced.

This government will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with councils and communities as we recover from this pandemic and renew our commitment to unite and level up the country.

We have a Prime Minister who truly understands the needs of local government. He is after all the first Mayor to become Prime Minister since Clement Attlee.

The Prime Minister, the Chancellor and I are all united in our confidence and determination that you as councils will receive the funding that you need to meet COVID-19 related expenditure.

The £500 million that I’m adding today is the next stage in that process, but I want you to have the reassurance that should further funding be required later in the year to meet those legitimate costs that we’ve asked of you and you’ve stepped up to deliver, then obviously I will do my very best to make sure you receive that from the Treasury.

The second pillar of our plan is non-tax income.

I’m pleased to announce a major new scheme today, which will help to reimburse the majority of lost income during the pandemic and to boost cash flow.

I am announcing the scheme now, as I recognise that you need certainty to continue delivering local public services.

We all know these income streams vary from year to year, but for some councils this year’s losses have been unparalleled, so where these losses are more than 5% of your planned income, I will cover from the exchequer 75p in every pound that you lose.

This is an unprecedented commitment by central government.

This means that if your council has a car park or a museum, a theatre or a leisure centre you run directly, we will support you and meet 75% of your costs.

We will be writing to you as soon as possible with more details of how the scheme will operate.

Obviously the beauty of the scheme is that it will flex up and down depending on the true cost to local councils that we will only learn over the course of the year. If some of the more conservative estimates are true, then this will cost less to the exchequer. If some of the larger estimates that I’ve seen turn out to be correct, then it will cost significantly more – potentially many billions of pounds.

You as council leaders and chief executives have the confidence to know that central government is standing behind you in either of those scenarios. I think that’s what matters now, to give you the confidence, stability and certainty to move forwards for the rest of the financial year.

And the third pillar is tax.

To further support you, we are announcing today that tax deficits can be repaid over 3 years rather than the usual one, giving you more flexibility in your budgets, relieving pressure at a difficult time.

No one knows today with certainty how much tax loss will materialise, which is why at the Spending Review, the government will agree a fair apportionment of irrecoverable council tax and business rates losses, between central and local government, for 2020 to 2021.

I hope you will see from the approach that we’ve taken to the second pillar, on irrecoverable income losses which are non-tax related, the way in which we intend to approach these challenges – to ensure a fair apportionment and to ensure you have the certainty that you need to move forward with confidence.

And we will continue to keep under review local authorities’ cashflow position for the rest of 2020 to 2021, as the impact of existing cashflow measures becomes apparent.

These measures together show our commitment to support local government, not just through the pandemic, but beyond it.

But of course, recognising the huge diversity of local government, the diversity of councils and of individual circumstances which I see every day, we appreciate that there may be some exceptional circumstances.

We don’t want to see any councils faced with unmanageable costs. I would strongly encourage councils who have those concerns to come to me and come to my department officials. My door is always open to have those conversations. Any councils leader who wants to  speak with me, I am at the end of the phone line and happy to discuss your needs.

Leicester and Test and Trace

On Saturday we will ease the national lockdown further, helping to revive our economy, opening local businesses and tourism and enabling friends and family to spend more time together.

But no one should think the virus has gone away, that this is mission accomplished.  Your leadership in your communities is absolutely vital to keep the incidence of the virus down.

In some places – Kirklees, Ashford, Weston-super-Mare – local leaders have tackled outbreaks quickly and have got the virus back under control. I am very grateful for their actions.

In Leicester the government has taken national action to ensure that we delay the easing of measures and again closing non-essential retail in the city.

You are all essential to controlling outbreaks.

I would like to take this opportunity to urge you to impress on your communities the need to adhere to public health advice: to socially distance, to wear masks on public transport and to keep washing hands.

These simple actions remain the most important ones.

And local councils must continue to monitor the application of COVID-19 secure guidance and take action where you see breaches.

Still, there can be local outbreaks as we’re seeing in Leicester.  At which point you must do everything you can to act quickly and decisively with Track and Trace, engaging with your local communities, Public Health England and others.

If you don’t act, the virus as we know can take hold. If necessary, the government will take national action to stop the risk of the virus spreading more widely.

We will keep driving up our testing capacity, which is already at over 280,000 a day…

…and we’ve made £300 million of funding available for local track and trace efforts, to help you develop tailored outbreak control plans together with local NHS and blue light partners.

But I’m not going to pretend that this is all easy – it needs a joined up approach from every part of government; an approach that involves:

Local Resilience Forums being ready to respond at short notice
  active policing
  clear communications
  a community-focused strategy – using multiple languages where needed; and of course
  access to the right data at the right times
There’s obviously a role for central government there to ensure you have that data and it works for you so you understand what’s happening in your local communities.

We have always said that lifting the lockdown was conditional. So while I hope Leicester will be the last local outbreak of coronavirus, we must be ready and prepared for more in other parts of the country – and we should never stop learning lessons as we go on.

For those people who are shielding, this will continue to be a nervous time. The individuals asked to shield are now advised that they can enjoy much greater freedom, with a pause in shielding from Monday, and a relaxation of guidance from the start of August.

But we must remain vigilant. It will take all our collective resolve and discipline to keep the virus at bay. And we must continue to work very closely with you and be ready to change the advice if unfortunately we have to.

COVID-19 next steps

This is a critical moment in so many ways – but it’s also a moment we must seize as a country. We have a unique chance to tackle some of the country’s great unresolved challenges.

Like rough sleeping. We are stepping up our efforts to stop people returning to our streets after COVID-19 – but we have to have a broader mission now to end rough sleeping once and for all.

We now have a unique opportunity to get people the right support to help them rebuild their lives.

The £105 million in additional funding we made available last week will support councils to ensure longer-term solutions are put in place instead of simply the emergency accommodation that we’ve used during the pandemic.

This is on top of the 6,000 new supported homes we are bringing forward to help rough sleepers – 3,000 plus of which will be available in the next 12 months.

The final part of our social recovery I want to reflect on is the vital work you have been doing to support adult social care throughout the pandemic.

We have provided you most recently with £600 million to pay for infection control in care homes, and this must get to providers as quickly as possible.

But we understand the challenges you face, and we’ll continue to work with you to monitor the situation; I can assure you we won’t hesitate to take decisive action where it is needed.

Matt Hancock the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, wanted to pass on his own message of thanks to the sector today. Because we understand just how important adult social care is – that’s been displayed vividly during the crisis – and how important it is that we now move forwards and get this right for the future.

As the Prime Minister recently reminded us: “We have to look after those who have looked after us”.

That is why we won’t wait to fix the problems in social care; we are finalising our plans and will try to build the cross-party consensus that we promised and we will try to ensure that the voice of local government is heard in those plans as we prepare them, publish them a seek broad consent for them.

Economic recovery and devolution

Local government will also be at the heart of our economic recovery too – and our broader mission as a government and the one we were elected on at the end of last year, to level up and unite our country.

As the PM set out on Tuesday, we’re committed to delivering an infrastructure revolution in each and every part of our country…

…and we’re determined to waste no time in our mission to ‘Build Back Better’, with a New Deal to get Britain building.

And at the heart of this mission is our plans to update our outdated planning system – to breathe new life into town centres and high streets and to ensure vacant buildings are given new opportunities for businesses to thrive and people to get jobs going in those parts of the country

And we’ve also launched this week our £900 million Getting Building Fund which will deliver ‘shovel ready’ infrastructure projects across all corners of the country. The allocations for that have been made today and local councils and LEPs can be involved in the next 2 weeks in determining which projects should move forward. The money will now flow and we want to get shovels in the ground as quickly as possible.

Meaning new projects, new ideas, and new jobs. All of which can be created in this financial year.

I’m looking forward to working with local leaders to deliver public buildings like schools and hospitals, and to ensure we build them as quickly as possible to meet the expectations of the public and our manifesto commitments to build those new hospitals and schools and public services people want to be delivered.

We’re also accelerating our £3.6 billion Towns Fund, to help 100 towns and communities build more prosperous futures and innovative plans for regeneration. I would like to see as many of those 100 town deals to be announced this year to get shovels in the ground and to boost confidence in those communities.

There must be no limit to our ambition to build beautiful, good quality, low-carbon, safe homes – especially on brownfield sites. And with the lifting of the HRA cap, that’s an ambition we must all share responsibility for

But this pandemic has brought about a profound rethink of the way we live and work.

We’ve seen how our councils can be the key to boosting the health, skills and education of people in every place – giving them the confidence to stay, raise their families and start businesses.

We’re building today the foundations for future prosperity tomorrow – raising our sights to when we are a fully independent and self-governing country for the first time in 45 years.

We now have a chance to shift power, not just from Brussels, but from Whitehall too.

The Prime Minister has asked me to publish our Recovery and Devolution white paper later this year to set out an ambitious place-based regional economic strategy – one which helps us to kickstart the recovery and to level up.

My colleague Simon Clarke will be talking in greater detail about our plans on that agenda tomorrow, but once again I want that to be jointly commissioned between central government and local government and for your views to be at the heart of your ideas and policies.

I’m clear: when it comes to devolution, we’ll be building on what we know works:

empowering local councils to lead the economic recovery
  ensuring local councils can play a fulsome role in health and education in local communities
  facilitating local government reorganisation where there is local demand
  more metro mayors where local communities want them, driving growth across economic areas that make sense, where there is local interest and where it can be done in harmony with local identities and to the benefit of the local economy and the delivery of local public services; and
  more dynamic regional partnerships, like the Midlands Engine and the Northern Powerhouse, but also in other parts of the country – helping our regions to gain a  global footprint and ensure all parts of Whitehall are working for those areas
For me, it’s about strengthening and empowering local leadership and local institutions to be the drivers of future prosperity.

Providing power back to local communities.

Conclusion

Like the rest of the world, we’ve faced the devastating impacts of COVID-19. We’ve been tested in ways we couldn’t have imagined just one year ago.

But it’s thanks to your efforts that we are beginning to turn a corner.

The lockdown is coming to an end. The economy is beginning to move forward. And the recovery is starting.

And if we can show the same kind of unity we saw at the height of the crisis, there’s no doubt in my mind that we will get through this, and the heroes of the pandemic will be the heroes of our recovery.

It’s a moment to strengthen our resolve and to come together as central and local government to deliver for the British people…

…and I will continue to do everything I can to keep delivering for you and to strengthen the bonds between national and local government to do just that.

Thank you very much for your time.","Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government and The Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP",2020-07-02,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/local-government-association-annual-conference-2020"
"159","Speech","Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 4 April 2020","Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove made a statement on coronavirus.","This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 4 April 2020:
Coronavirus press conference 4 April 2020.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our daily briefing in the fight against Covid-19.

I am joined today by Professor Steve Powis, Medical Director of NHS England.

I’d like first to update you on the facts about the spread of the coronavirus,

Then I will outline why it is so critical that we continue to observe the rules on social distancing.

Thirdly, I will explain what we are doing to increase the capacity of the NHS to deal with this disease.

And finally, I want to say something about how we can all work together to defeat this invisible enemy.

First, the facts as they stand today.

As of 9am today, a total of 183,190 people have been tested, of which 41,903 tested positive.

15,073 people in England have been admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms.

But the pattern of hospital admissions in England and Wales has regional differences.

In London, the number of admissions fell slightly between the 1st and 2nd of April.

Admissions are steady in Wales.

But in Yorkshire and the North East they have gone up by 35% and in the Midlands, the rate of hospital admissions has gone up by 47%.

708 people have sadly lost their lives as a result of Covid-19: the highest daily total yet recorded.

And that means that of those hospitalised in the UK, the number who have passed away now totals 4,313.

Those numbers emphasise again the importance of maintaining social distancing measures to halt the spread of the disease.

More than ever, we must ‘stick with it’, as the Prime Minister said in his video message.

Now I know that life under lockdown can be challenging. Some will be tempted, on this sunny weekend, to venture out and about.

But, as the Health Secretary underlined, yesterday, if we relax our adherence to the rules we increase the risk for others.

That’s why it is so important to stay at home. Protect the NHS. And to save lives.

We need to think of those on the frontline, and the sacrifices that they are making for us. As the Chief Nursing Officer for England reminded us yesterday.

Ruth May asked us to remember two NHS nurses who died after contracting Covid-19.

Areema Nasreen, who was just 36, and Aimee O’Rourke, aged 39, each had three young children.

They died while doing everything they could to help the sick and suffering.

We can all best honour them by playing our part in fighting the disease by staying at home and slowing the spread.

Seven healthcare professionals have now lost their lives to Covid-19 and we offer our heartfelt condolences to their grieving families - and to the many others mourning the loss of loved ones.

They include the family of Ismail Mohamed Adbdulwahab, who died aged just 13 in King’s College Hospital in London.

His mother and siblings are showing symptoms of the virus, and they were unable to say their final goodbyes at his funeral. In their despair, the loving, dignified tributes from Ismail’s parents are truly haunting.

Our thoughts today are also with the family of the five-year-old child with underlying health conditions who has tragically died.

So again: you must stay at home, to protect the NHS and to save lives.

Whatever the temptation this weekend please don’t go outside, to the lakes, the beaches or the countryside.

Take pride instead in keeping your own families and communities safe.

The more we restrict contact, the more we slow the spread of the infection – and the more time we have to build capacity in the NHS so that we can treat those who are most in need.

And I want now to outline how we are increasing NHS capacity.

Yesterday we were grateful to HRH the Prince of Wales, himself recently recovered from Coronavirus, for opening the brand new Nightingale Hospital in east London, a testament to brilliant teamwork and determined leadership from the NHS.

Two weeks of hard work have transformed a convention hall into a fully-functioning field hospital that can treat 500 COVID-19 patients on ventilators or through oxygenation.

New Nightingale hospitals are due to be built in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Belfast, Glasgow, Harrogate, and Manchester.

And given we now know that the Midlands are a particular area of concern, the NHS and the military are accelerating their existing work to transform the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham into a 2000-bed Nightingale Hospital. I have spoken to the mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, earlier today and he is doing all he can with the NHS, to accelerate that work.

Of course, a critical part of ensuring the NHS is resilient is improving the testing of staff. 10,984 tests were administered yesterday – and as the Health Secretary outlined on Thursday we have a strategy to increase that number to 100,000 a day.

Testing is a critical part of the clinical pathway that we all follow in seeking to reduce the impact of COVID-19.

But the next vital step is appropriate pharmaceutical treatment.

That is why as the Health Secretary explained clinical trials are now taking place to see if anti-virals which have helped in the fight against HIV, and anti-malarial medicines such as hydroxychloroquine, can reliably reduce the harm the coronavirus inflicts.

The next stage in the clinical pathway is ensuring those patients with impaired lung functions get the oxygen they need – and this is where ventilation comes in.

We have been working to increase the ventilator capacity across the NHS.

Ventilation can be non-invasive and invasive.

Effective non-invasive ventilation can ensure patients do not need to be placed on invasive ventilators – where they are intubated and supported to breathe with machinery which takes oxygen direct into their lungs.

We have secured new non-invasive capacity with the help of UK manufacturers who have worked at pace to develop new technologies. A team from University College London working with Mercedes Benz have produced a new device which has been clinically approved. They produced 215 yesterday, have produced the same number today and tomorrow, rising to 1,000 a day next week.

We are also increasing the capacity of the NHS to deploy invasive ventilation.

We have been buying invasive ventilators from partners abroad, including Germany and Switzerland. And today, 300 new ventilators arrived from China. I’d like to thank the Chinese Government for their support in securing that capacity.

And we have developed new sources of supply here in the UK, with existing and modified models being made in greater numbers and new models designed to come on stream soon.

The first models which have been scaled up as part of the Ventilator Challenge will be coming off production lines this weekend.

More are to come into operation in the coming weeks, subject to safety and regulatory approvals, as part of the Prime Minister’s call to manufacturers to scale up production.

Increasing this production has involved securing supplies of critical components – from lithium ion batteries to flow regulators – from across the globe to assemble here.

The first of the ventilators that the government has ordered from Penlon, a medical devices company based in Oxfordshire, will be begin arriving in hospitals this week for final clinical checks.

We are grateful to the MOD personnel who will be delivering them, as we are to all the companies who have devoted time, staff and resources to fighting Covid-19.

The first devices from Smiths Group have also been received at MOD Donnington, a military logistics hub in Shropshire: these have been approved by the regulator.

The initial dispatch is the result of scaled-up manufacturing of an existing mechanical ventilator design - and we are grateful for the efforts of an industry consortium including GKN Aerospace and Rolls-Royce.

These ventilators will be distributed to hospitals this week.

And next week, UK production of another ventilator device from the companies Diamedica and Plexus will start at their factory in Kelso, in Scotland. The design is based on an existing product already in use in the NHS.

The more ventilators – invasive and non-invasive – available to the NHS, the more patients can get the care they need when they need it.

But the process of design, testing, assembly and manufacture does take time.

We need to make sure these devices are safe and their manufacture scaleable.

The challenges in increasing numbers are formidable – which is why the commitment of the scientists, engineers, designers and civil servants involved in this work is so impressive.

But you don’t need to be a scientist or engineer to help them.

All you need to do is observe the social distancing guidelines that have been put in place.

The more we all stay at home, and slow the spread of the disease, the more time we buy for more ventilators to come on stream and for the NHS to become more resilient.

Finally, I want to turn to the way in which all parts of our country are coming together to fight this invisible enemy.

Teachers have kept schools open for those who need them – and parents have kept their children at home wherever possible – so we enter the Easter Holiday weeks with school attendance having been around just 2% - ensuring the most vulnerable can be cared for.

For children eligible for free school meals, vouchers will be available over the holidays to support household incomes.

But I am conscious more must be done – particularly over the holiday period – to support children at risk and in need, and we will be saying more next week about work in this area.

I also recognise that we are asking a lot of the British people.

And we in Government therefore have a responsibility to communicate as clearly as possible.

Clear, factual, timely information.

And an honest assessment of the difficulties we all face – as well as proper recognition of the achievements of those on the frontline who are doing so much to fight this disease.

Adapting to this pandemic has meant developing guidance, implementing new policies and co-ordinating efforts across government at an unprecedented pace.

Inevitably, there has therefore been criticism of some government actions.

I recognise that criticism has been designed to challenge the government’s performance and improve to our response. Which is why I welcome it.

Even as we unite in our efforts to defeat the virus we must also recognise that robust scrutiny is to be welcomed – and is the duty of the media.

Which is why we are acting to both share robust information and support our media by investing more in our government information campaign which is being disseminated through the national media and local newspapers and radio.

We will share essential health advice and information on the support packages available from the Chancellor for workers or for businesses.

We will share details of how you can help volunteer to support our NHS or the vulnerable; and also how you can help British farmers by buying more locally-grown products, and we will also list dozens of other ways you can join the national effort against Coronavirus.

We are using social media to reach young people, some of whom have been more reluctant than others to follow social distancing rules.

And in this united national effort, where we need both constructive challenge and a shared spirit of national endeavour, we want to make sure that we all work collaboratively to help defeat the virus.

That is why we have been co-ordinating daily with our colleague in the devolved administrations, why I spoke yesterday to my friends in the trade union movement Frances O’Grady and Len McCluskey and why the Prime Minister has written today to the leaders of all opposition parties, including the new leader of the Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer.

I would like to congratulate Sir Keir on his victory and wish him well in his important role.

And I would like again to emphasise that all of us can do our bit this weekend in that united national effort

Thank you Mr Koumjian. The United Kingdom reiterates its support for the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar.

Accountability for human rights violations committed across Myanmar is a key step towards reconciliation and long-term stability. We have not yet seen enough progress from Myanmar to address the actions of the military in 2017, and conflict continues. Hundreds of homes have been burnt down this month in Rakhine, and civilians forced to flee. All sides must respect international law and protect civilians.

We urge Myanmar to cooperate with the IIMM as well as other international justice mechanisms, and to take steps to strengthen domestic accountability processes. This includes setting out a transparent and credible plan to implement the recommendations of the Rakhine Advisory Commission, the Independent Commission of Enquiry, and the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice.

We recognise the positive step that Myanmar’s Parliament recently took to amend the three-year limitation period on courts martial. The Tatmadaw must now respond to this in good faith, and take steps to improve the procedure’s transparency. This will help increase public trust in accountability measures and deter further crimes.

Mr Koumjian,

What actions can the international community take to further support the IIMM?","Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and Rita French",2020-09-14,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/un-human-rights-council-45-statement-for-the-interactive-dialogue-with-the-head-of-the-independent-investigative-mechanism-for-myanmar"
"161","Speech","Addressing the pressing humanitarian need in Syria","Statement by Ambassador Jonathan Allen at the Security Council briefing on the humanitarian situation in Syria","Thank you very much, Mr President.

Let me just start, if I might, Mr President, by saying that I think it’s really important that we try to keep the politics out of our humanitarian discussions. That’s one reason why we separate out into political, chemical weapons and humanitarian sessions each month on Syria is to enable us to focus on the evidence and the facts as we grapple with how we keep people alive, which is surely the most vital responsibility that this Council faces. So I have to say I listened with sadness today to one delegate whose intervention was an attack on those providing aid across Syria and those paying for it. And I want to remind everybody that the biggest donors to the Syria appeal are the US, the UK, Germany and the EU, including those areas under Assad’s rule.

So, Mr President, what does an evidence-based approach tell us? Well, the UK is deeply concerned about the potentially catastrophic impact of COVID-19 in Syria, as highlighted by the World Health Organization. There are 48 confirmed cases in areas controlled by the Syrian authorities, as well as confirmed cases in the north-east and reported cases in the north-west. There are probably already many more. We cannot know because of the lack of testing capacity. And as the United Nations scales up prevention and protection against COVID-19 in areas controlled by the Syrian authorities and in the north-west, it follows that it must be allowed to do the same in the north-east. So it is gravely concerning the gaps in medical supplies in the north-east have in fact widened at a time when facilities should be urgently scaling up to prepare for the virus.

The UN has confirmed that in terms of coverage or reach, cross-line access in the north-east has not improved since 2019, when the Yaroubiya crossing was still operational. It’s for this reason that in his latest report, the Secretary-General said, “The pressing need to prepare for a COVID-19 outbreak in the north-east has further and starkly highlighted the gap left by the removal of the Yaroubiya authorisation.”

Colleagues, this could not be clearer. There is a clear problem in the north-east and the United Nations and humanitarian organisations have told us what the answer is. We must not play politics with this virus when it’s in our gift to enable aid to get through and save lives. We believe the mandate for the Yaroubiya crossing should be re-authorised as a matter of great urgency for as long as COVID-19 remains a threat to Syria.

Now, Mr President, let me turn to the north-west. If our objective is to save life, then it is absolutely necessary that this Council renews UNSCR 2504 in a timely manner. Monthly truck crossings in March and April of this year have been more than double what they were at the same time last year. This increase in aid is in response to the increased humanitarian need within the region. So the renewal of Resolution 2504 remains essential. There is no alternative. And I’d just like to emphasise that if Resolution 2504 were not to be renewed, then no one should have any illusions that the United Kingdom’s considerable humanitarian funding for the north-west would automatically transfer to delivery via Damascus - particularly, while such serious questions remain about assistance getting from Damascus to those most in need.

A number of colleagues have talked about sanctions. Goods and medical supplies used for humanitarian purposes are not subject to EU sanctions, which are now part of the United Kingdom’s national legislation, and additional exemptions from sanctions are available for humanitarian activities in Syria.

In conclusion, Mr President, the evidence is clearly set out in the Secretary-General’s report. There remains a pressing humanitarian need across Syria. We must remember the millions of lives at stake. COVID-19 has changed the world we all live in. It has changed the situation on the ground in Syria. And I believe that it means we must be ready to change our approach. We must put aside our political differences and act on the basis of humanitarian needs to authorise temporary cross-border access through Yaroubiya. And we must, of course, renew Resolution 2504. There is no other responsible course of action any of us could take.

Thank you, Mr President.","Foreign & Commonwealth Office and Jonathan Allen",2020-05-19,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/addressing-the-pressing-humanitarian-need-in-syria"

To tackle the climate crisis, governments around the world must come together, as we are doing today.

To learn. To unite behind common causes. And to encourage each other to make the most of the opportunities ahead.

We all know that the coronavirus pandemic has caused terrible harm – both human and economic.

But the recovery is a chance for all of us to build back better. To create clean jobs. And to place green growth at the heart of our economies.

That is what we are doing here in the UK.

Since March, we have put the equivalent of 450 million US Dollars into cutting emissions in heavy industry.

And almost US$1.3 billion driving the move to low-emissions vehicles.

We are confident in this approach to our recovery because we know it works.

Over the past 30 years we have grown our economy by 75% whilst cutting emissions by 43%.

Creating thousands of jobs in new industries in the process.

Our offshore wind capacity is now the largest in the world.

Employing thousands of people directly, and through supply chains.

And the price of offshore wind energy has fallen by two-thirds between 2015 and 2019.

Renewables are now cheaper than new coal and gas power plants in 2 thirds of countries.

As a result, we can say with confidence that the UK will meet its ambition to phase out coal power by 2024.

And from April to June this year we went 67 days without coal.

There are immense opportunities for those developing the technologies the world needs to move to its low-carbon future.

For example, Europe’s electric vehicle market grew by almost 50% between 2018 and 2019.

And, globally, renewables are expected to attract 77% of all investment in electricity systems between now and 2050 – worth around US$10 trillion.

There has never been a better time to invest in the green economy. Or a more important time.

To limit warming to 1.5 degrees, we need to halve global emissions over the next decade.

But we are not currently on track to do so.

People are suffering now as a result of our changing climate. And the window of time we have to act is closing fast.

As incoming COP26 President, the UK believes in bringing together countries across the world, to make progress faster.

We all need to focus on critical areas: clean energy, clean transport, nature-based solutions, adaptation and resilience, and finance.

We need all countries to submit more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions, driving further cuts in carbon emissions by 2030.

And we need all nations to commit to reaching net zero emissions as soon as possible. As we have done in the UK – we will be net zero by 2050.

Ladies and gentlemen.  We are at a critical moment for the world’s climate.

To limit temperature rises, we must take this chance and unite behind a clean, resilient global recovery.","Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP",2020-09-03,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/platform-for-redesign-2020-opening-address"
"163","Speech","International Labour Organisation Virtual Global Summit","The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions participated in the International Labour Organisation Virtual Global Summit on COVID-19 and the World of Work.","Good afternoon colleagues and thank you, Director General, for the opportunity to contribute to this important discussion. I particularly want to thank you Guy, congratulate you and the ILO for organising these Global Summit events, including the Europe Day last week and Global Leaders’ Day yesterday.

I welcome the interventions so far today from the distinguished representatives of other governments and of worker and employer organisations.

The Centenary Declaration adopted by the ILO last year underlined the need for a human centred future of work and the priorities it set out remain valid now as we look towards recovery from the COVID-19 emergency.

As others have said, COVID-19 is the biggest challenge the world has faced in decades. The ILO and its constituents have a critical role to play in the socio-economic response. We all share the same objectives – to protect workers and businesses, and to support a swift and safe economic recovery.

And in the UK, we have had good consultation with our social partners on our response to this emergency. After record employment rates just a few months ago here in the UK, we acted swiftly to avoid mass unemployment with the introduction of a Job Retention Scheme in which the government guaranteed 80% of employees’ pay up to £2,500 a month, and a similar support scheme for the self-employed with grants that would help support workers and businesses through this time.

These schemes have been a lifeline to millions of people, with 9.4 million people supported on the Job Retention Scheme and 2.7 million people who are Self-Employed. This is covering in effect, over a third of working people in our country. We are making some changes to increase the flexibility in both schemes to help prepare people to get working fully again as we will phase out the Job Retention Scheme entirely by the end of October.
For those on the frontline, we have ensured that our occupational health and safety systems continue to protect health workers and indeed all others who deliver critical public services. We have developed tools and measures to help the safe return to work for the wider UK economy.

Our main social security system, Universal Credit, responded excellently to the unprecedented numbers of claims. We made temporary changes on access to benefits to manage that demand and to get money to people as quickly as possible. We also injected several billions of pounds directly into the welfare system. The distribution analysis that we published yesterday shows that our interventions so far have largely helped the poorest in our nation reflecting the importance of social justice for this government and is at the heart of our decision making during this emergency.

As we are now over the peak, we are returning to a focus of helping people into work as quickly as possible. We must ensure that our measures continue to protect all workers in need, including those with disabilities and the should be irrespective of gender, ethnicity, race, age, religion or other status.

The UK launched its ‘Plan for Jobs 2020’ yesterday and it builds on and bolsters existing support offered.

Training will be crucial for those without work, so that they maintain their work-readiness and they may need new skills to quickly move back into work. We are particularly focusing on young people, who are already disadvantaged due to their lack of skills and work experience. That is why we have announced the largest ever expansion of traineeships to ensure that 16-24 year olds have the tools needed to enter the world of work and why we are introducing a “Kick-Start Scheme” to create more decent jobs for young people.

The impacts of the crisis are also felt disproportionately by women, who are over represented as frontline care workers and they experience violence and harassment in the workplace, and continue to do the majority of unpaid care work.

At the global level, the UK has made available substantial amounts of aid funding to help mitigate the impact of coronavirus on the world’s most vulnerable countries. This is in addition to pivoting much of our existing international development activity to provide health, humanitarian and economic support where it is needed most.

The role of social protection in reducing poverty, building resilience and reducing humanitarian needs globally is highly relevant to this emergency. The UK is committed to helping governments to increase the coverage, quality and sustainability of their systems and to build more inclusive systems particularly for women and girls.

A major concern is that the pandemic reverses years of progress towards the ending of forced labour and similar issues. That’s why we support the Alliance 8.7 call for an urgent and coordinated multi-stakeholder response to this common threat.

And finally, as the UK takes up Presidency of the G7 next year we will look to support an open, sustainable and inclusive global recovery to the pandemic.

Thank you.","Department for Work and Pensions and The Rt Hon Thérèse Coffey MP",2020-07-10,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/international-labour-organisation-virtual-global-summit"
"164","Speech","Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 1 June 2020","Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock gave the 1 June 2020 daily press briefing on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus briefing.

We’re going to do things slightly differently today. I’m going to go through the charts. I’m joined by Professor John Newton from the test and trace programme. We’ll then answer questions from the public and from journalists.

If there’s one message that we have today it’s that it is incredibly important for anybody who has symptoms of coronavirus – a cough or a fever or a change in your sense of taste or smell – that you get a test.

It’s by people coming forward to get a test, which you can get on nhs.uk/coronavirus or by dialling 119. It’s by getting those tests that we’re able to identify those who have the virus, ensuring you get the best possible treatment and ensuring that we can then trace the virus and through that we can control the virus.

That is the most important message and what everyone can do to help control this virus.

The first slide shows testing capacity and new cases. Yesterday there were 128,437 tests in the UK, meaning there has been a total 4.48 million tests carried out since the start of this crisis. Of course testing capacity stands at a higher level, 206,444.

This shows there is extra capacity for more tests and tests are available right now on the website if you go to nhs.uk/coronavirus or dial 119. I want to highlight that because it’s so important that people come forward for a test and anyone who needs a test can get a test.

The next chart shows that there are 1,570 cases confirmed as of yesterday. This is the lowest number since 25 March. In total, 276,332 cases have been confirmed. But this number of 1,570 shows that we’ve seen continued downward progress is the number of new confirmed cases.

We’re getting this virus under control, which is why we can make the cautious, small, positive steps we’ve been able to make today. If we look at the number of admissions to hospital with COVID-19, 479. That’s down from a peak of 3,121 on 2 April. The proportion of people on mechanical ventilators, the number which corresponds to that 9% figure, is that there are 606 people on mechanical ventilators. Again, that is the lowest since late March.

The picture is repeated across the country. We’ve seen in almost every case the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 is the lowest since late March. As of yesterday there were 7,541 in hospital with COVID-19.

The final slide. Sadly, 39,045 people have died with coronavirus, confirmed with a positive test. That’s 111 yesterday. Again, that figure is the lowest figure since lockdown began on 23 March.

We can see from these charts the pattern right across the board, which is that we’re making significant progress, but that there is still more to be done.

I want to say a few notes of thanks: thanks to our volunteer responders who in their hundreds of thousands have come forward and stepped up to the plate.

Thanks to the charities and the charity groups who are working so hard in very difficult times.

Thanks to colleagues in the NHS and in social care. Also to the businesses, pharmaceutical companies and diagnostic companies, without whom we simply couldn’t have mounted this response.

To the pharmacists and the dentists, and I’m very pleased that dentistry is going to restart from next week. Especially for their hard work and their understanding, all of the families who stand behind those who are on the frontline.

At the start of pride season, I want to take a moment when we can’t get together as we normally would to thank all colleagues in the LGBT community who do so much in the NHS and across social care.

I think this data shows that the action plan is working. The data shows that we’re winning the battle against coronavirus.

Today, we’re therefore able to make some cautious changes to the lockdown rules, carefully and safely. Of course these are balanced judgements and we take these decisions very carefully.

We must all remember that, in the war against this virus, we are all on the same side. We’ve come so far together, we can take these steps together. But do not step too far. The disease is not done yet. We mustn’t throw away the progress that has been made.

Please take your responsibility seriously. If you have symptoms you must get a test and if the NHS asks you to isolate you must do so.

To everybody, stay alert, control the virus and save lives.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-06-02,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-1-june-2020"
"165","Speech","Adapting Security Council working methods to be innovative and agile","Statement by Ambassador James Roscoe, Acting Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, at the Security Council briefing on Working Methods","Thank you, Mr President, and thank you also to our briefers this morning. I would like to thank you, Mr President, and Estonia and St Vincent and the Grenadines for arranging this meeting and for bearing the concept note that will inform our discussions.

Mr President, as others have said, COVID-19 has presented an unprecedented challenge to this Council over the last two months or so. Most importantly, the spread of this disease has had significant implications for international peace and security that the Council needs to address. But it’s also presented major challenges for the Council’s working methods. And in my intervention today, I will consider how the Council has adapted to these challenges before moving on to more general points.

So firstly, on COVID, I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of China, the Dominican Republic and Estonia. Under their presidencies in March, April and May, the Council has been able to move to a position where open videoconferences of the Council cannot be broadcast live on UNTV. And we are able to adopt resolutions and PRSTs through written procedure. We should not understate the work that has been required to achieve this outcome, including from the Secretariat. The move to broadcasting Council videoconferences in full was a particularly important step for the transparency of the Council’s work.

But the UK regrets that the Council working methods have not been able to respond in a more agile and effective way to this crisis. I recall in this context Article 28 of the Charter, which requires the Council to be organised in a way that enables it to function continuously. Due to a lack of Council consensus, neither the Council nor its subsidiary bodies have held formal meetings since the 12th of March. There are therefore no verbatim transcripts of our meetings. Our technical platform has not been able to accommodate simultaneous interpretation or open debates and continues to suffer from occasional technical glitches. Meetings are conducted without the benefit of the established framework of the provisional rules of procedure and the mechanisms for resolution of disagreements that they provide. We all hope that we can return to the chamber soon, but as long as we are confronted with these extraordinary circumstances, we need to continue to pursue opportunities for improving our working methods. When we do return to the normal, we need to consider how we can put contingency plans in place to ensure that we are able to respond more quickly and effectively to any future crises. Last week’s Arria on the anniversary of Victory in Europe Day showed us what can be done with quite some style.

Mr President, I would like to turn to the potential tension between transparency and effectiveness that is highlighted in the concept note. One significant challenge in this regard is maintaining an appropriate balance between open and closed meetings. Achieving the right balance requires Council members to approach the monthly programme of work with an open mind. It is too easy to fall into the trap of following the same format each time an issue appears on our agenda. One option that I would like to highlight is the private meeting; the opportunity for UN member states to participate provides an element of transparency, but the closed nature of the meeting removes the temptation to address the media rather than Council colleagues.

But, Mr President, the assumption that closed meetings are more effective does not always hold true. To be effective, Council members need to enter these meetings with a willingness to engage in a discussion and consider action. Regrettably, we still see too many examples of Council members reading up prepared statements or refusing to engage in a serious discussion of outcomes or next steps.

My final point on transparency relates to civil society. The UK believes that engaging with a diverse set of briefings is an important element of transparency, and we will continue to promote civil society participation in Council activity. But as highlighted in the Arria that the UK and the Dominican Republic held in February, the Council needs to do better at handling the risk of reprisals to our briefers. We look forward to continuing discussions with Council colleagues on this important issue.

Turning to efficiency, there has been some progress in bearing down on speaking times to the Council, but the Council still spends too much time in lengthy meetings that address the conflicts of yesterday rather than shouldering its responsibilities to address today’s conflicts and prevent future conflicts. We support informal horizon scanning briefings by the Secretariat and the development of sofa talks to address this challenge. It’s important that we use these opportunities effectively, and as Professor Luck has said, implement agreed working method reforms were widely.

But informal discussions are no substitute for Council meetings, not least for reasons of transparency. We must therefore continue to subject the Council’s programme of work to critical analysis and be prepared to bring new issues to the Council. The current crisis means that the Council’s work on prevention is more important than ever, and I was pleased to hear Ms. Landren’s point on systemic threats. We have to look beyond the immediate geographic nature of the challenge to the wider challenges like climate that threaten us more globally.

The UK is also prioritised reducing the length and the pace of Council products over the recent years. We’ve had some success, especially with reducing the length of peacekeeping mandates. But there is more work to be done and the UK will maintain our focus on this.

In conclusion, Mr President, the Council’s working methods have perhaps never been under greater scrutiny. While we have made significant progress since March, our ambition should be for the Council to be a leader in innovation and agility. And we must remember fundamental reason for this Council’s existence and ensure all we do best serves that purpose. I look forward to continuing discussions on how we can rise to that challenge.

Thank you, High Commissioner for your update. The systemic discrimination facing the Rohingya in Myanmar prevents them from living safe and dignified lives.

The UK is deeply concerned by the restrictions Rohingya face in accessing healthcare. To combat the growing COVID-19 outbreak in Rakhine effectively, every person needs to be able to access medical facilities, treatment, and COVID-19 testing, regardless of documentation status, religion, nationality or race.

The majority of Rohingya cannot access township hospitals where treatment for COVID-19 takes place. Instead, they often seek treatment in Station hospitals or clinics, however many of those are now closing. We urge Myanmar to allow mobile clinics so Rohingya can safely access medical services for any urgent condition.

It is essential that camp based staff and volunteers have permission to continue life-saving activities. We encourage Myanmar to restore international humanitarian agencies’ access on completion of quarantine, including in conflict affected areas.

The UK also calls on the Government of Myanmar to restore 3G/4G internet services to all of Rakhine and Chin, allowing populations access to lifesaving information including on transmission prevention.

Addressing this issue is critical as societies respond to, and recover from, COVID-19.

When women have access to opportunities for economic participation, the benefits extend far beyond individual girls and women to societies and economies as a whole. Therefore, we must make women’s economic empowerment and women’s rights, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights, central to the global COVID-19 recovery.

Education is the key to unlocking economic growth and sustainable development. That is why we reaffirm our commitment to 12 years of quality education for every girl everywhere.

We welcome the Working Group’s report which identifies barriers to the right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work such as the persistent gender pay gap – the UK upholds our commitment to equal pay for equal work. As we mark the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, we must accelerate action to tackle these obstacles.

"168","Speech","Speech to ICAEW Virtual Conference","The Rt Hon Jesse Norman MP, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, spoke at the annual conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants for England and Wales (ICAEW) on HMRC’s response to Covid-19, and his future vision for the tax system.","Thank you very much indeed, Frank, and I also thank Anita, Daniel and all of the team that set up this amazing event.

I have to say when you told me it was three days of online streaming and dozens of speakers and thousands of watchers, I thought this was nothing less than the Glastonbury of tax. I congratulate you on pulling that off. I think it’s an extraordinary achievement.

Of course I am not really surprised that this conference is going ahead, because the tax community is always ready, willing and able to embrace digitisation, and I’m going to come on to that a little later in my remarks.

Frank, you’ve done that very brilliant chairman thing of roping in fifteen different topics that I’m supposedly going to talk to you about! I’m happy to take any of those in questions, but the three areas I’m going to focus on are:

HMRC’s response to Covid-19 and the pandemic
  the core question of how HMRC focus on their main business – that is, collecting tax
  and then, something I care very deeply about, and I’m thrilled that we have been able to make massive progress on in the last few months, which is the 10 year plan we’ve published for HMRC to create a trusted, modern tax administration system
Let me start by saying that of course I am hugely proud of what HMRC have done in relation to Covid. I think it’s been an astonishing set of outcomes for them. But I also think that HMRC—and it’s one of the lessons we’ve learnt on this—HMRC can’t operate in a vacuum. They need trusted stakeholders, they need a tax system that’s working, they need many, many organisations and people around them to be as effective as they are and would like to be.

The ICAEW make an enormous difference, and its members too. So whether they are identifying areas for improvement, or helping us to consult, or improve schemes – thank you, and thank you ICAEW members very much indeed.

I should also say that we are coming to this, as you will appreciate, in a very specific economic context, certainly unlike any other in recent experience. We’ve now formally entered recession for the first time in eleven years. This is a highly unwelcome development although, alas, not surprising given the wider situation.

The Chancellor has made perfectly clear his view that there will be hard times ahead, and last week’s figures confirm the truth of that statement.

And of course, it’s true that hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, despite the incredibly valuable efforts that HMRC and my Treasury officials have been engaged in, trying to protect the economy and protect businesses and protect employment.

It’s sobering to reflect that many more people will almost certainly face redundancy or unemployment in the next few months.

Having said that, I do think HMRC’s work can play an absolutely vital role in trying to mitigate the damage the pandemic is doing, and HMRC are at the centre of this activity too, as we’re going to discuss.

You will appreciate that none of our public services would be deliverable if it wasn’t for the funding that comes through tax revenue, and that’s of course the core of HMRC’s responsibilities.

You don’t often hear HMRC ministers talking about them being at the forefront of delivering huge and successful new programmes, in record time and at the centre of the government’s response to a crisis, but that is what HMRC have done. As I say, I think it’s a tremendous achievement.

Let me say also, we are acutely aware that by no means every aspect of every scheme is perfect. This process has been done at a blistering pace. We have been pulling together schemes as quickly as we can, and officials have been working around the clock to make sure that we deliver programmes that deliver the maximum good for the maximum number of people as quickly as possible, with the minimum of fraud.

It might be worth just touching briefly on the results. The furlough scheme so far has helped 1.2 million employers claim just under £36 billion. HMRC have also helped around 2.7 million self-employed people claim nearly £8 billion in grants, and helped employers by reimbursing some of the costs of statutory sick pay for COVID-related absences.

In the case of Eat Out to Help Out, some 85,000 restaurants have now registered and the total amount claimed is £180 million, from 35 million covers claimed.

So these are huge numbers, and to put that all in place at such speed is a considerable achievement.
What I think is less noticed, but to me at least, and to you as tax connoisseurs, no less important, is that HMRC have also implemented more than 60 policy changes and easements. They include things such as:

the deferral of tax payments through the VAT system and deferral of Income Tax Self-Assessment payments due in July 2020
  introducing a temporary relief for customs duty and import VAT on PPE and other medical supplies used to help combat Covid-19
  assisting in the production of millions of additional litres of alcohol hand sanitiser. HMRC set up a specialist team who moved very quickly to increase production of denatured (undrinkable) alcohol which has proved very important in fighting the virus
It’s very interesting how brewers and distillers have also moved very quickly into that market and have created new markets for themselves. I’m not going to pass by this issue without singling out the Black Mountain Botanicals distillery in my constituency – who have done exactly that to great effect.

So that’s the wider context, but of course that in itself raises the question of where do we go from here? Is there going to be a ‘new normal’ for HMRC, and what does that new normal look like? For HMRC, it does mean a refocussing and a reconsideration of the key principles by which they operate, again focussing wherever possible on supporting individuals, supporting businesses, protecting the taxpayer and ensuring the money comes in to fund public services.

So what are those key principles?

The first one will be that HMRC will continue to collect the tax due, but do so, as far as possible, in a way which supports taxpayers in the work they are doing and in particular, supports businesses that are supporting their employees. We want businesses to be doing the right thing and we want to do everything we can to support them in the way they do that.

HMRC should communicate transparently and openly. That is very important. The consent on which a tax authority exists, and the consent of the wider tax system, requires open and transparent communication.
It is of course always vital, for similar reasons, that HMRC should continue to be professional, fair and even-handed in their dealings with taxpayers.

Where HMRC have introduced temporary arrangements that have improved taxpayers’ experiences or created operational improvements, they need where possible to build on these changes to deliver long-term sustainable solutions.

Finally, HMRC must continue to collect the money that pays for the UK’s public services, and that means continuing to prioritise tackling serious fraud and criminal attacks on the tax system, while making it as easy as it can be for individuals and businesses pay the right tax at the right time, without difficulty.

So those principles really remain unchanged, but I think extended in some key areas. Let’s talk a little bit about how that might work.

Of course, HMRC will still issue penalty notices. But they should take a sympathetic approach to those who are struggling to pay their tax or file their returns. HMRC will accept the impacts of COVID-19 as a reasonable excuse, if properly evidenced, and will offer longer periods to request a review or appeal a decision.

Similarly, HMRC have restarted debt collection activities, and it’s absolutely right that they should do so. Of course they recognise, and I recognise, that some individuals and businesses remain in uncertain financial circumstances.

So HMRC will initially focus on collecting debts from taxpayers who are least affected by COVID-19 and most able to pay their tax debts. Having said that, if you at ICAEW or any of your members’ clients have concerns about their ability to meet tax obligations, please ask them to get in touch with HMRC now, to see how they can be supported though deferrals or Time to Pay or any of the other measures that we’ve introduced, so that they have adopted every measure to which they are entitled.

So that is the full picture, but that in itself yields to consideration of what the future will bring, and there you get into the issue of HMRC’s 10-year strategy and all the work we’ve been doing on the tax administration system.
You and your members will have seen that last month we published the 10 year Tax Administration Strategy. I am delighted about that, it is fantastic to be able to put a 10 year process out there, so people have a proper sense of the direction in which we’re heading and can plan accordingly. Software providers can, I hope, flood into the market with new databases, platforms and apps which assist people to pay tax effectively and have the best possible interaction with the tax system.

That whole plan, as your members will know, having probably read it and cosseted it closely, is a strategy of focus and collaborative improvement. I think it has the potential to yield huge benefits. If you read it, you will see that collecting tax, while an important function, is by no means the only aspect of that plan. It’s also very important to support HMRC’s ability to act to improve our national resilience. They have been able to do that with the furlough scheme, and that’s surely a very important function for them evolving over time.

I also think the process of nudging people into digitisation isn’t just good for them—and note that many people have voluntarily adopted MTD for VAT already—but it also has a tremendous potential productivity benefit for the economy as a whole. We have a long tail of businesses in the UK which are quite low on productivity, so this has a much wider potential economic benefit.

So those three areas, tax, resilience and productivity are all at the centre of this plan. What does this involve? Well it means greater flexibly, resilience and responsiveness in the tax system. It means improvements to businesses’ digital skills, and it means a series of measures focussed on reforming the tax administration in a way that reflects the modern economy, so that it is working in real time, it is allowing people and businesses to pay the right tax, without tax becoming a burden or too intrusive or difficult. And of course, it does enable the government to continue to support the economy and businesses and individuals at times of crisis.

What does that mean in practice? In the first case, it means extend Making Tax Digital (MTD) and pressing on with digitisation as they have done in countries like Denmark, Finland, New Zealand, Australia and many others. That’s very important.

Having successfully introduced a new, digital VAT service for business, we will be:

extending MTD for VAT to VAT-registered businesses with turnover below the £85,000 VAT threshold from April 2022
  introducing MTD for Income Tax Self Assessment for businesses and landlords with business and property income over £10,000 from April 2023
  consulting on the detail of MTD for Corporation Tax in Autumn 2020.
So we are giving businesses, individuals and the software industry a long lead-in time to ensure people have time to prepare for this change. And for Income Tax Self Assessment taxpayers we’ll have the threshold so that those earning under that sum can opt out if they wish, though one of the fascinating things has been that many businesses have chosen to opt in to MTD despite not being covered by it as they fall below the threshold.

We think this is the start of a really interesting process as we continue to embrace technology,
And what do we want to see from that? Well we obviously want to see greater use of real-time information. That’s a vital component – it’s currently very hard for the taxpayer to have an immediate picture in real time of tax liabilities. It’s a big change, but it does help the government. Let’s be clear that if we had had a more up to date picture of taxpayers’ financial position, that would have enabled SEISS support to be better targeted for those who needed it. Quarterly reports submitted before the introduction of SEISS would have given us almost a further full year’s data, and this would have enabled us to pay SEISS grants based on self-employed workers most recent trading levels.

There will thus be concrete improvements to people’s lives and the resilience of their businesses coming out of these potential changes.

We also want to explore options for timely payment of taxes, and I realise different sectors face different challenges in this regard. The delays in the UK system can make it hard for people to manage cashflow, particularly for the newly self-employed, whose first tax bill could be up to 22 months after they start trading. We want to open a debate, a wider discussion, about the pros and cons of bringing tax payment more into line with the increasingly real-time nature of tax reporting and other taxpayer services. Of course that could have the effect of helping people to avoid a cashflow crisis at their end and stop them falling into debt, so it would have great benefit. We also want to push ahead towards a secure, easily accessible single digital account. We want taxpayers to have one complete financial picture which draws on different sources of information and enables HMRC to provide a more tailored service to their needs.

Alongside that, but very importantly for the ICAEW and your members, we want HMRC to improve services for agents and representatives, who we regard as an integral part of the wider tax system, and we want to support them and help them do what they can to support their clients, and of course we want to raise standards in that area.
And the final thing, the bit that often gets forgotten. I know none of this is big box office in political terms… but even in this area, the thing which tends to get forgotten is the importance of modernising the Tax Administration Framework. Our current framework is complex and somewhat out of date. It needs to be simplified and it needs to be brought up to date. And the goal of that is to allow HMRC and taxpayers to benefit from advances in the use of technology and data, for example by simplifying processes so that businesses need only register once with HMRC for all taxes, and to stop this current system where people have to go around navigating different rules, processes and deadlines for different taxes, and having to sign up with the tax authority on several occasions.

So this, taken together, is I think quite a significant and important moment. Actually, I think it’s important for the country, not just for tax wonks. I think it forms a coherent package of change, and a long term package of change, and I am very excited about it.

I want to reiterate my sincere thanks to the ICAEW for their collaboration already – both with officials and with me personally – in taking this strategy forward. I am committed to working very closely with you and with the industry and agents tax profession in order to understand and improve the tax administration system over the next few years.

I am now very happy to take questions—and thank you everyone again for coming, and to you, Frank and ICAEW for inviting me to address this conference.","HM Treasury, HM Revenue & Customs, and The Rt Hon Jesse Norman MP",2020-08-20,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-to-icaew-virtual-conference"

We welcome this Urgent Debate, which provides an important opportunity to draw the Council’s attention to, and act with resolve on, the current situation in Belarus.

The United Kingdom does not accept the results of the fraudulent Presidential election in Belarus.

We condemn the excessive use of force by the authorities against peaceful protestors, the targeting and detention of journalists and the expulsion of opposition figures.  We continue to call on the Government of Belarus to respect the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and freedom of expression for all, including for journalists and media workers.

We have called for an independent OSCE investigation into the fraudulent election processes, and related human rights violations.

The UK also supports imposing sanctions against those responsible.  We are working with our international partners to hold the Belarusian authorities to account. 

The UK is doubling its financial support to independent media, human rights organisations, and community groups in Belarus, with an extra £1.5m for project work over the next two years.

The authorities in Belarus must enter into a constructive dialogue with the opposition and people of Belarus.  It is vital that the Belarusian people are heard and can determine their country’s future.

Thank you.","Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and Wendy Morton MP",2020-09-18,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/un-human-rights-council-45-statement-for-the-urgent-debate-on-belarus"
"170","Speech","G20 Labor and Employment Ministers’ summit on COVID-19","On Thursday 23 April, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Thérèse Coffey attended an Extraordinary G20 Leaders' Summit on the COVID-19 pandemic.","Thank you Minister and good afternoon everyone.

  Thank you for bringing us together today. I believe that we, as G20 Labour and Employment Ministers, have a responsibility to provide a strong and coordinated response to the impact of COVID-19 on our labour markets.

  This pandemic highlights the importance of the global family and our shared commitment to the multilateral framework.  In just a few months, everyday life has changed dramatically across the world and we have all felt the profound impact of this virus on our countries and communities. The UK shares the deep sadness caused by the tragic loss of life and the suffering faced by people across the world. I reiterate the commitment made by our Leaders during the G20 summit in March, that tackling the pandemic should be our absolute priority. I welcome the adoption of the G20 Action Plan by our Finance Ministers last week, and in particular the commitments made to protect our workers.

  I also applaud the G20 presidency on their pledge of $500 million that Saudi Arabia have announced to the global effort to combat COVID-19. It’s a great example for us all.

  I thank the ILO, OECD and the World Bank for your detailed analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on our labour markets. I also thank the B20 and L20 for their contributions.

  We share the same objectives – to protect workers and businesses, while enabling everyone to return to a strong working economy as quickly as possible.

  During this emergency, the UK government has and will continue to take every step to ensure that no-one – whatever the status of their employment – is penalised for doing the right thing in protecting themselves, their families and their communities.

  Like many others around this table, we have announced an unprecedented package of measures to protect people’s jobs and incomes.

  Firstly, we have introduced a COVID-19 Job Retention Scheme under which employers are eligible to apply for a government grant of 80% of a worker’s salary up to £2,500 a month. Already, after 3 days of registration, over 2.8 million jobs have been saved.

  While many UK companies already offer generous sick pay packages, to ensure we have a safety net of support for those who have symptoms or have actually contracted the virus and are unable to work we have ensured that the UK’s legal minimum Statutory Sick Pay provisions are now available from day one, providing workers who are unwell with continuous financial certainty.

  For the self-employed, the UK has introduced a scheme for eligible workers to receive up to £2,500 per month for at least three months.

  For those on low incomes, the UK has announced a package of temporary welfare measures worth over £6.5 billion.

  We kept schools open for the children of those parents designated as key workers, including public sector workers and those supporting welfare and critical supply chains. Many online courses are being provided for free for people of all ages.  We are extending our antigen testing to key workers or someone in their household who show symptoms.

  It is vital that our occupational health and safety measures continue to protect those still working, whether that be our frontline health and care workers or the people keeping food supply going from field to fork. Our Health and Safety Executive Agencies are working closely with Public Health agencies on this on safe working practice guidance.

  The UK will continue to support those who are most vulnerable. We must ensure that our measures continue to protect all workers in need, regardless of employment status, age or gender. We recognise that the impacts of the crisis are felt significantly by women, particularly as they make up a large percentage of frontline care workers and also continue to do the majority of unpaid care work. We retain our ambition of an economy where everyone has the opportunity to enter work and progress, while being supported by the welfare system in their time of need.

  I am grateful for the opportunity to share the UK’s actions and for the opportunity to learn from the approaches taken in your countries.

  The UK strongly supports the statement we are making today. We are now in the midst of our critical period of response. We should also consider the longer term consequences and how together we can act for a sustainable and inclusive recovery of the global economy. I encourage close alignment and engagement with the other G20 tracks.

  Minister, I thank your Presidency for your speed in action in setting up this meeting and I look forward to further debate today and in September. Thank you.

"171","Speech","Supporting Least Developed Countries through short and long-term pandemic recovery","Statement by Tom Woodroffe on Least Developed Countries (LDCs) at the UN High Level Political Forum.","The COVID-19 crisis has led to an unprecedented shutdown of large parts of the global economy, with severe consequences for all countries. As we have heard today, African countries, LDCs and LLDCs are likely to be among the hardest hit.

The UK recognises this immense challenge. It will be critical for the international community provide support to overcome the immediate health and humanitarian impacts of the pandemic, and to stop regression of hard-won development gains. We are grateful to the Government of Qatar for hosting the fifth LDC Conference in 2022, and the UK is committed to working with all colleagues to agree an ambitious plan of action for the next decade that delivers the necessary international support to LDCs.

COVID-19 has also exacerbated SDG financing challenges. For our part, the UK will strive to leverage private finance and investment in LDC economies to overcome the expected shortfalls. In January, the UK-Africa Investment Summit facilitated more than £6.5 billion of business deals in infrastructure, energy, retail and tech sectors. The UK also announced £1.5 billion worth of government initiatives designed to promote UK investment in Africa, which aims to create employment and mobilise over £2.4 billion of additional private investment.

We are also clear that the threat posed by climate change to African countries, LDCs and LLDCs will not go away. Disaster preparedness, mitigation and resilience will be key to long-term recoveries. This thinking will be at the centre of the UK’s COP26 ambition.

Finally, alongside our partners the EU, Fiji and Rwanda, we will also lead the UN Financing for Development workstream on recovering better for sustainability.

As we recover, the decisions we make today have the potential to pave the way forward for sustainable growth, and to create just and inclusive societies. There can be no return to the ‘old normal’. We look forward to working with you all to identify the best way recover better, support the most vulnerable, and to place enhanced climate action at the heart of recovery.

Thank you very much.","Foreign & Commonwealth Office",2020-07-09,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/supporting-ldcs-through-short-and-long-term-pandemic-recovery"
"172","Speech","Coronavirus shows that health and work are inextricably linked","The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care addressed the British Chambers of Commerce on the role of business in tackling coronavirus.","It’s not often that a Health Secretary gets invited to the British Chambers of Commerce.

And I don’t think you’ve invited me here because of my reputation as an app developer.

I want to talk today about coronavirus and the contribution that British business can make in helping us as a nation to tackle it.

But I also want to say what a huge honour it is to address you today.

For a pro-business Conservative like me, the keynote speech at the BCC is a bit like being asked to play at Lord’s.

This organisation speaks for British business so well because it is so firmly rooted in communities.

I know that because my mum was a member of her local Chamber up in Cheshire.

And because your brilliant chair Sarah was, until very recently, chair of my local Chamber in Haverhill in Suffolk.

Why I back business

Before I turn to coronavirus, I want to say something about why I believe in business, which I think is very important and which we must always hold onto and remember.

It’s not just the jobs you create.

It’s not just that I’m deeply mindful of who it is that pays for the NHS.

It’s more than that.

It’s that business done right is a force for good in the world.

Because great businesses succeed by solving other people’s problems.

Look at the life sciences.

Just recently, I announced a deal with Novartis that will mean the NHS is among the first in the world to access a brand-new cholesterol lowering drug at scale.

This is a twice-yearly injection that could prevent tens of thousands of heart attacks.

Life sciences: the clue’s in the name. They save and improve lives.

And business done right is a moral force for good because it links effort and reward.

It’s about something for something.

For this is really personal.

I grew up watching my parents battle, against the odds, to build a brilliant software business.

And I know what the challenges feel like.

In the recession of the early 90s, we almost lost everything because of a late payment problem.

The business was strong, orders were coming in, but we were literally one cheque from going under.

And I remember the feeling of injustice, that everything they’d worked so hard for was on the line, all because of a problem that was not of their making and was outside of their control.

Now fortunately, that cheque came through and the business went on to thrive. But that experience is engraved on my heart.

In politics I’ve always worked for economic security as the foundation of everything else.

Because I know, like you know, that the economy is not just numbers on a spreadsheet, it’s people’s hard work and livelihoods and dreams.

Right now, leading the healthcare system’s response to coronavirus is of course taking up the overwhelming majority of my time.

But I’m very conscious that over the last few weeks, small businesses across the country will have been listening to the news and worrying about the future.

Something outside their control.

So let me turn to the biggest near-term challenge facing British business.

Coronavirus action plan

Our approach to tackling coronavirus is to prepare for the worst and work for the best.

We’re basing our preparations not just on the most likely scenario but on the reasonable worst-case scenario.

This week you’ll have seen we published our 4-part action plan to contain, delay, research and mitigate the virus.

That plan is driven by the science and guided by the expert advice of the Chief Medical Officer and others.

Contain - the phase we’re currently in - means detecting the early cases, tracing their close contacts and preventing the disease from taking hold in the UK for as long as is reasonably possible.

This approach has bought time for the NHS to ramp up its preparations.

But the scientific advice is that we may not be able to contain the virus forever, especially if the number of cases continues to rise in Europe.

At that point, on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, we will activate the next phase of our plan, which is to delay.

This is about slowing the spread, lowering the peak impact and pushing it away from the winter season when the NHS is under maximum pressure.

I will always prioritise protection of life, but we will seek to minimise the social and economic disruption too.

Because the scientific advice is very clear that going too far or too fast carries risks of its own.

Ultimately, we are working to a timetable that is set by the progress of the virus itself.

With 85 confirmed positive cases in the UK, shutting down all our schools and universities for example would not have a clinical benefit at this stage.

But it would impose huge social and economic costs.

So we will follow the science.

And that brings me to the third phase which is research.

Research been ongoing ever since the moment COVID-19 was identified at the end of last year.

We have some of the finest scientific minds in the world working day and night on a vaccine.

But we do not think a vaccine will be available in the coming months.

And just as important, is research to understand what currently available drugs and treatments might help those who are already sick.

I’m incredibly proud of the team at Public Health England who were among the first to sequence the genome of the virus.

And that British businesses like Oxford Nanopore are providing the testing kits used around the world.

We could not do this without you.

If coronavirus does become established in the UK population, we will only be able to delay widespread transmission for so long.

At that point, we will move to the mitigate phase of our plan.

This is about focusing our resources as a nation on supporting those who are most seriously ill and keeping essential services going at a time when large parts of the workforce may be off sick.

You may have seen some of the estimates that we published in the action plan.

We have a range of options to support businesses, supply chains and the wider economy should the situation require it.

I know that the Business Department and the Treasury are thinking very hard about how to do this in the budget next week.

I know the hit that many businesses are already taking.

I understand the sense of trepidation that something outside your control is such a looming risk on the horizon.

I will do everything I reasonably can, not just to protect business but to help business through.

This is going to be a difficult time for us all.

What I can offer is transparency and support and a rational science-led approach.

And I know this, not least because I started my life surrounded by small business: we in government can’t do this alone.

The role of business

Tackling coronavirus is a national effort.

As UK businesses, you have a crucial part to play in helping us respond.

First, we need you to engage.

Engage with us, keep talking to us so we incorporate your views into our preparations.

Second, we need you to stay informed.

We’ve published specific guidance for employers on GOV.UK.

It tells you what to do if someone in your workplace comes into contact with COVID-19, along with advice for responding to it.

Third and most important of all, we all need to support our employees to do the right thing, including to self-isolate if necessary.

Yesterday we announced that we will bring forward measures to allow the payment of statutory sick pay from the first day that you are sick.

Many occupational sick pay systems already do this.

Our principle is clear: no one should be penalised for doing the right thing and following the official medical advice to self-isolate if they test positive.

It’s in your employees’ interest, it’s in your interest, and it’s in the national interest.

Health and work

One of the things that this experience has taught us is that health and work are umbilically linked.

It’s a lesson that we can’t afford to forget once we get through this.

Yes, of course you need a strong economy to pay for the NHS, but a strong NHS is good for business too.

Healthcare that’s always there for you, unconditionally, supports a risk-taking entrepreneurial economy.

And increasingly, it’s recognised that the nation’s health is not just the NHS.

We know that only around a quarter of what leads to longer, healthier lives is the result of what happens in the health service.

A quarter.

The rest is down to genetics, the environment and the lifestyle choices we make.

Businesses have real influence over the last two.

A job that’s purposeful and rewarding is good for your health. And almost by definition, employers have a chance to intervene much earlier than the NHS.

We all need to play our part.

Mental health support. Musculoskeletal support. Bike racks and shower facilities. Flexible working. Support for healthy eating.

These are not businesses costs, they are investments. Just like your investment in your skills and training budget.

It’s how, after this epidemic, we will bear down on the £9 billion a year lost to sickness absence.

And it’s one big part of how we deliver on our long-term goal of 5 extra years of healthy life.

We are not powerless in the face of this virus.

We have the best minds and a clear plan of action.

Everyone can do something, even if it’s as simple as washing your hands more often.

The coming weeks will be tough, but with calm heads and clear determination together we will see this through.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-03-05,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/coronavirus-shows-that-health-and-work-are-inextricably-linked"

Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street for the daily coronavirus briefing.

I’m joined by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries, and by NHS England’s Medical Director for Primary Care, Dr Nikki Kanani.

I want to take this chance to update you on the latest coronavirus data. 2,353,078 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 133,784 tests yesterday. 236,711 people have tested positive for the virus, an increase of 3,560 since yesterday. 10,024 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus. This is a 13% fall from the same time last week.

And very sadly, of those who tested positive, across all settings, 33,998 people have now died. That’s an increase of 384 since yesterday. And we mourn each one. The number of deaths is falling each day, in all settings thankfully, and we are past the peak of this virus.

I want to take a moment to remind everyone about our plans for this second phase. We have set up the new COVID Alert Level System. That’s the five levels of threat – based on the R value and the number of new cases. The alert level in turn guides the social distancing rules, which are vital in our efforts to control the virus.

A higher alert level means stricter rules. Throughout the lockdown, we have been at level 4 which means that Covid-19 is in general circulation and transmission is high or rising exponentially.

But, thanks to your shared sacrifice, we’ve brought R down. Cautiously, carefully and responsibly, we are now in a position to start moving to level 3.

We’ve set out the first of the 3 steps that we’ll take to carefully modify the social distancing rules and start to restore freedom to this country, all the while avoiding a disastrous second peak that could overwhelm the NHS.

At each step, we will closely monitor the impact on R, on the number of new infections and on, of course, all available data. And we’ll only move to the next step when we judge it is safe to do so.

In the first step, as of this week, if you work but can’t work from home, you should speak to your employer about going back in. People can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like and you can meet 1 other person from outside your household in an outdoor, public place. But please keep 2 metres apart.

This weekend, with the good weather and the new rules, I hope people can enjoy being outside but please stick with the rules, keep an eye on your family and don’t take risks.

We’ve also updated what we’re asking people to do, which is to stay alert, control the virus and save lives.

For the vast majority of people, staying alert still means staying at home as much as is possible. Working from home when you can, limiting contact with people, keeping your distance if you go out, 2 metres wherever possible, washing your hands regularly. This is still the single most effective thing that you can do to keep yourself safe and, of course, self-isolating if you or anyone in your household has coronavirus symptoms.

By staying alert and following the rules, you can play a part in the national effort getting the R down and keeping R down, controlling the virus so that we can save lives, rebuild livelihoods and start to recover our freedom.","Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP",2020-05-15,"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-15-may-2020"

Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street press briefing. I’d like to start with the daily update on the latest data on coronavirus.

The first slide shows cases confirmed with a test:

7,121,976 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 140,359 tests carried out or posted yesterday.
  299,251 people have tested positive, an increase of 1,115 cases since yesterday.
The second slide shows the latest data from hospitals:

387 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 14 June, that is down from 435 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April.
  379 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 494 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April.
The third slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country:

There are now 5,308 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 13% from
6,123 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,698 on 12 April.
  As you’ll see from the graphs while there is some variation, most nations and regions of the UK are broadly following a similar pattern.
The fourth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus:

Across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 42,153. That’s sadly an increase of 184 fatalities since yesterday.
  When you measure that on a  7-day rolling average, the daily number of deaths currently stands at 146, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.
As you’ll see from those slides we’re making important progress, and today marks another milestone.

In just under an hour’s time, the best league in the world will be back up and running after a 100 day pause.

All but five countries will be airing tonight’s games - underlining football’s global reach and the soft power of UK sport. The Premier League is returning and the world will be watching.

Of course it will be very different to what we’re used to.  But there is no doubt that this is a hugely symbolic moment.

An important step forward in our careful journey back towards normality, players back at their place of work, and a boost for our football loving nation.

We’ve worked really hard with the football authorities, police and medical experts to get to this point. But we do need fans to play their part too.

So please, look after your fellow fans and your communities by watching from home.  To keep the home advantage, support from home.

All 92 remaining Premier League games will be shown live on television, and I’m delighted that I and others managed to  work hard to get a third of them on free-to-air channels.

Friday will be the first on free-to-air, with Norwich versus Southampton. Then an important day on Saturday , that will be the first ever Premier League game on the BBC, followed by the Merseyside Derby again free to air on Sunday.

And there will be extended highlights of all the games free to air. So you won’t have to miss a single goal.

Our sports men and women have set some incredible examples during this pandemic, using their profiles to support worthwhile causes across the UK.

England’s men’s and women’s cricket teams have donated half a million pounds towards charitable causes.

Rugby League’s Cheshire West Bank Bears have delivered food and parcels to the elderly.

And of course, England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford has made the front pages and the back pages for the very best reasons - highlighting the struggles facing many families during this difficult time but that is of course in addition to the fantastic work he’s been doing helping to feed millions of children through the FareShare charity.

The last three months have demonstrated the immense power of sport. It brings us together through kindness and common humanity.

I was struck by this last week when I teamed up with the His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge and some of Britain’s biggest sports stars on mental health awareness.

We chatted about the need to deliver generational change in perceptions, and develop tools for good mental health - whether you’re a sports star at the top of your game, or a junior just starting out, or a fan going through a difficult period.  As we get sport back, I really think this is a great opportunity for all of us to be much more open about talking about mental health.

The sports recovery was never just about elite sports. I know countless people are itching to get back to their gyms and leisure centres, to their five-a-side leagues and all their other normal fitness activities.

We’re working closely with the sector to get grassroots and community sport back up and running as soon as it is safe to do so, with an aim of the start of July at the very earliest.  And as we continue our efforts to get children back to school, I want to focus on the role sport can play in improving young people’s physical and indeed their mental health.

Today is an important moment in our recovery. The return of elite sport has provided a model to follow. One based which is based on close partnership working with government, sport and the medics to bring it back safely.

It’s a model we are applying to other much-loved and much-missed parts of our economy - in particular the performing arts.

I know they face enormous challenges, particularly given the impact of social distancing on live venues, and I am looking hard at how we can address those challenges.

Over the last few weeks and months, I have been talking extensively and intensively with people from across the UK’s cultural sector to find a way through these issues - from some of our most creative directors and producers, to those running our greatest museums, theatres and music venues.

An important part of this is to get performances back up and running again. We have made a lot of progress through both the Cultural Renewal Taskforce and indeed the  Entertainment and Events working group which sits within that. However, it is clear that we need greater flexibility to overcome some of the very specific and practical obstacles to the return of live performance.

That’s why over the next week we will be convening experts in a targeted way - bringing together some of our leading performers in theatre, choirs and orchestras with medical experts and advisers.

The idea is they will work together in detail to develop that roadmap which is so badly needed to perform safely, with a particular focus on piloting innovative ideas that may permit live performances.

I know how essential our theatres, our music venues and the performing arts are to our wider cultural ecosystem.

Culture is our calling card. It’s respected around the world, and I am determined to work with them and across government to support it and to preserve its world leading position.

Today’s return of live football represents a significant milestone. But I hope it’s just another  step towards normality, to be followed by many more in the months to come.
